Chapter 1: Crimson
Painful!
How painful!
My head hurts so badly!
A gaudy and dazzling dreamworld ﬁlled with murmurs instantly
shattered. The sound asleep Zhou Mingrui felt an abnormal throbbing
pain in his head as though someone had ruthlessly lashed at him with
a pole again and again. No, it was more like a sharp object pierced
right through his temples followed by a twist!
Ouch… In his stupor, Zhou Mingrui attempted to turn around, look
up, and sit up; however, he was completely unable to move his limbs
as though he had lost control over his body.
From the looks of it, I’m still not awake. I’m still in a dream… Who
knows, perhaps the next scene will be of me thinking I’m already awake,
but in fact, am actually still sleeping…
Zhou Mingrui, who was not unfamiliar with similar encounters, tried
his best to focus in order to escape the shackles placed upon him by
the darkness and confusion.
However, while still in his reverie, whatever will he could summon
was ethereal like a ﬂeeting fog. He found his thoughts diﬃcult to
control and introspect. No matter how much he tried, he still lost his
focus as random thoughts surfaced in his mind.
Why would I suddenly have such an excruciating headache in the middle
of the night?
And it’s really painful!
Could it be something like a cerebral hemorrhage?
F**k, don’t tell me I’m going to die young?
I need to wake up! Now!
Eh? Why doesn’t it seem to hurt as much as before? But why does it still
feel like a blunt knife is slicing through my brains…
From the looks of it, sleep is impossible. How am I to show up for work
tomorrow?
Why am I still thinking about work? This is some authentic headache. Of
course I have to take time oﬀ! I don’t have to worry about my manager’s
grumblings!
Hey, putting it that way, it doesn’t seem too bad. Hehe, I can end up
getting some spare time for myself!
Throbbing pain inundated Zhou Mingrui, allowing him to slowly
accumulate immaterial strength until he was ﬁnally able to move his
back and open his eyes. He ﬁnally broke free from his reverie.
His vision ﬁrst blurred before it was screened by a faint crimson red.
All he could see was a study desk made of burly wood in front of
him. Right in the middle was an opened notebook with coarse,
yellow pages. The title was eye-catchingly written with strange, deep
black lettering.
To the left of the notebook was a stack of neatly arranged books,
numbering about eight. The wall on their right was inset with
grayish-white pipes with wall lamps connected to them.
The lamp had a classical Western style to it. It was about half the size
of an adult’s head with an inner layer of transparent glass and an
exterior gridded with black metal.
Diagonally beneath the lamp was a black ink bottle shrouded in a
pale red glow. Its embossed surface formed a blurry angel pattern.
In front of the ink bottle and to the right of the notebook sat a dark-
colored pen with a fully circular body. Its tip shimmered with a faint
glint while its cap rested right beside a brass revolver.
A gun? A revolver? Zhou Mingrui was completely taken aback. The
things laid before him were alien to him. It looked nothing like his
room!
While feeling shocked and confused, he discovered that the desk,
notebook, ink bottle, and revolver were covered in a layer of crimson
‘veil,’ a result of the light shining from the window.
Subconsciously, he looked up and shifted his gaze up bit by bit.
In midair, a crimson moon hung high above the backdrop of a ‘black
velvet curtain,’ glowing in silence.
This… Zhou Mingrui felt inexplicably horriﬁed as he stood up
abruptly. However, before his feet fully straightened, his brain
protested with throbbing pain. It made him temporarily lose his
strength as he fell uncontrollably. His buttocks slammed heavily onto
the burly wood chair.
Pa!
The pain did little. Zhou Mingrui stood up again by propping himself
up. He turned around in a ﬂuster as he began to size up the
environment he was in.
The room was not very large, with a brown door on each side of the
room. Close to an opposite wall was a low wooden bed.
Between the bed and the left door was a cabinet. Its two doors were
swung open and beneath it were ﬁve drawers.
To the side of the cabinet, there was the same grayish-white pipe on
the wall at the height of a person. However, it was connected to a
strange mechanical device with exposed gears and bearings in several
spots.
Items resembling coal stoves sat in the right corner of the room near
the table, along with soup pots, iron pots, and other kitchen utensils.
Across the right door was a dressing mirror with two cracks. Its
bottom was made of wood and the patterns were simple and plain.
With a sweep of his gaze, Zhou Mingrui noticed himself in the mirror
—the present him.
Black hair, brown pupils, a linen shirt, thinly built, average-looking
features and a rather deep outline…
This… Zhou Mingrui immediately drew a gasp as many helpless and
confused guesses surfaced in his mind.
The revolver in ancient European style and the crimson moon that
looked diﬀerent from Earth’s moon could only mean one thing!
C-could I have transmigrated? Zhou Mingrui widened his mouth
slightly.
He had grown up reading web novels and had often fantasized over
such scenes. However, he momentarily found it hard to accept the
situation when he found himself in one.
This was probably what it meant to love a fantasy 1 ? In a minute, Zhou
Mingrui had already cursed himself while trying to make the best out
of his adverse situation.
If not for the still throbbing headache that made his thoughts high
strung but clear, he would have deﬁnitely suspected that he was
dreaming.
Calm down, calm down, calm down… After taking a few deep breaths,
Zhou Mingrui worked hard to stop panicking.
At that moment, as his mind and body calmed down, memories
began ﬂooding him as they slowly appeared in his mind!
Klein Moretti, a citizen of the Northern Continent’s Loen Kingdom,
Awwa County, City of Tingen. He is also a recent graduate from the
Department of History at Khoy University…
His father was a sergeant of the Royal Army who had sacriﬁced
himself during a colonial conﬂict with the Southern Continent. The
bereavement allowance gave Klein the opportunity to study at a
private language school and laid the foundation for his admission
into university…
His mother was a devotee of the Evernight Goddess. She passed away
the year Klein passed the entrance examinations to Khoy University…
He also had an elder brother and a younger sister. They stayed in a
two bedroom apartment together…
Their family was not wealthy and its situation could even be
described as somewhat wanting. At present, the family was supported
solely by the elder brother who worked at an import and export
company as a clerk…
As a history graduate, Klein grasped knowledge of the ancient Feysac
language—deemed the origin of all languages in the Northern
Continent—as well as the Hermes language which often appeared in
ancient mausoleums as well as text regarding sacriﬁcial and praying
rituals…
Hermes language? Zhou Mingrui’s mind stirred as he reached out to
rub his throbbing temples. He cast his gaze toward the table at the
opened notebook. He noticed that the text on the yellowed paper
turned from strange to alien, before turning from alien to something
familiar. It then turned into something readable.
It was text written in Hermes language!
The dark ink wrote the following:
“Everyone will die, including me.”
Hiss! Zhou Mingrui felt inexplicably horriﬁed. He instinctively leaned
back in an attempt to widen the distance between him and the
notebook, as well as the text on it.
Being very weak, he nearly fell down but managed to extend his
hands in a ﬂuster to hold onto the edge of the table. He felt that the
surrounding air was turbulent as though there were faint murmurings
resounding in it. The feeling was akin to hearing horror stories being
recounted by elders when he was young.
He shook his head, believing that everything was an illusion. Zhou
Mingrui found his balance and shifted his gaze from the notebook as
he heaved for breath.
This time, his gaze landed on the shimmering brass revolver. He
suddenly had a question arise in him.
With Klein’s family situation, how can they have the money or means to
buy a revolver?
Zhou Mingrui could not help but frown.
While in deep thought, he suddenly discovered a red handprint to the
side of the table. Its color was deeper than the moonlight and much
thicker than the ‘veil.’
It was a bloody handprint!
“A bloody handprint?” Zhou Mingrui subconsciously ﬂipped his right
hand that had been holding the edge of the table. Looking down, he
saw that his palm and ﬁngers were covered in blood.
At the same time, the throbbing pain in his head continued. Although
it had weakened a little, it continued incessantly.
Did I smash my head open?
Zhou Mingrui guessed as he turned around and walked towards a
cracked dressing mirror.
A few steps later, a black-haired ﬁgure of medium build and brown
eyes appeared clearly in front of him. The person had a distinct
scholarly air to him.
Is this the present me? Klein Moretti?
Zhou Mingrui was stunned momentarily. Since there was insuﬃcient
lighting at night, he failed to see something clearly. He continued
forward until he was just a step short from colliding with the mirror.
Using the crimson veil-like moonlight as illumination, he turned his
head and examined the corner of his forehead.
A clear reﬂection appeared in the mirror. His temple had a grotesque
wound with burn marks along its periphery. Blood stained the
wound’s surroundings and there were grayish-white brain juices
squirming slowly within.
Chapter 2: Situation
Tap! Tap! Tap!
Zhou Mingrui reeled back in fear at the sight that greeted him. It was
as though the person in the dressing mirror was not himself, but a
dessicated corpse.
How could a person with such grievous wounds be still alive!?
He turned his head in disbelief again and checked the other side.
Even though he was a distance away and the lighting was poor, he
could still see the penetrating wound and dark red blood stains.
“This…”
Zhou Mingrui drew a deep breath as he tried hard to calm himself.
He reached out to press his left chest and sensed his racing heart that
exuded immense vitality.
He then touched his exposed skin. Beneath the slight coldness was
ﬂowing warmth.
When he squatted down and after verifying that his knees could
bend, Zhou Mingrui stood up again and calmed down.
“What’s happening?” he muttered with a frown. He planned to
inspect his head injury seriously once more.
He took two steps forward and suddenly paused. The moonlight of
the sanguine moon was relatively dark, so it was insuﬃcient for his
‘serious inspection.’
A memory fragment triggered as Zhou Mingrui turned his head to
look at the grayish-white pipes and the metallic-gridded lamp on the
wall right beside the study desk.
This was the most common gas lamp of the times. Its ﬂame was
stable and its illumination capabilities were excellent.
With Klein Moretti’s family situation, even a kerosene lamp was a
dream, much less a gas lamp. Using candles was most apt for their
standing and stature. However, back when he burned the midnight
oil four years ago to be admitted into Khoy University, his elder
brother, Benson, felt that it was an important matter which their
family’s future depended upon. Therefore, he insisted on creating
conducive studying conditions for Klein even if it meant taking on
debt.
Of course, Benson, who was literate and had worked for several
years, was not a rash person who did not think of the consequences.
He had quite some tricks up his sleeve. He reasoned with the landlord
to ‘raise the apartment’s standards by installing gas pipes to improve
the likelihood of rentals in the future.’ The landlord was convinced
and provided the money to complete the basic modiﬁcations. Then,
using the convenience of working at an import and export company,
he purchased a brand new gas lamp which was nearly at cost price.
In the end, all he needed was to use his savings and did not need to
borrow money.
After the memory fragment ﬂashed past his mind, Zhou Mingrui
came to the desk where he turned the pipe’s valve and began twisting
the gas lamp’s switch.
With a sputtering sound, a spark sounded from friction. Light did not
descend upon Zhou Mingrui as he had expected.
He twisted the switch a few more times, but all the gas lamp did was
sputter and remain dark.
“Hmm…” Retracting his hand and pressing on his left temple, Zhou
Mingrui sought for the reason by rummaging through his memory
fragments.
A few seconds later, he turned around and walked toward the door.
He arrived at the machine installation which was similarly inset into
the wall and had grayish-white pipes connected to it.
This was a gas meter!
After seeing the exposed gears and bearings, Zhou Mingrui took out a
coin from his trousers’ pocket.
It was dark yellow in color and had a bronze shimmer to it. The front
of the coin was engraved with a portrait of a crown-wearing man,
and there was a ‘1’ on a clump of wheat on the back.
Zhou Mingrui knew that this was the most basic currency of the Loen
Kingdom. It was called a copper penny. One penny’s purchasing
power was roughly three to four yuan before his transmigration. Such
coins had other denominations such as the ﬁve pence, a halfpence
and a quarterpence. Despite the three types, the denominations were
not in small-enough units. In everyday life, one had to buy several
diﬀerent things just to spend a single coin from time to time.
After ﬂipping the coin—which was only minted and circulated after
King George III ascended to the throne—a few times, Zhou Mingrui
inserted it into the gas meter’s thin vertical ‘mouth.’
Clink! Clang!
After the penny fell to the bottom of the meter, the sound of grinding
gears sounded immediately, producing a short but melodious
mechanical rhythm.
Zhou Mingrui stared at the meter for a few seconds before returning
to the burly wood desk. He then reached out to twist the gas lamp’s
switch.
After some sputtering, there was a sharp sound!
A ﬁre plume ignited and rapidly grew. Bright light ﬁrst occupied the
internals of the wall lamp before penetrating the transparent glass,
blanketing the room with a warm glow.
The darkness quickly receded as the crimson retreated out the
window. Zhou Mingrui felt at ease for a baﬄing reason as he quickly
came in front of the dressing mirror.
This time, he seriously inspected his temple and did not miss a single
detail.
After a few rounds of inspection, he realized that apart from the
original blood stain, liquid was no longer ﬂowing out of the
grotesque wound. It appeared like it had received the best hemostasis
and bandaging. As for the slowly squirming grayish-white brain and
the discernible growth of ﬂesh and blood around the wound, it meant
that the wound might take thirty to forty minutes, or maybe even
two to three hours before it would only leave a light scar.
“The restorative eﬀects that transmigration brings?” Zhou Mingrui
curled up the right corner of his mouth as he muttered silently.
Following that, he let out a long sigh. Regardless, he was still alive!
After settling his mind, he pulled open a drawer and took out a tiny
piece of soap. He took one of the old and tattered towels hanging by
the side of the cupboard and opened the door. He then walked to the
public bathroom which was shared by the tenants on the second
ﬂoor.
Yes, I should clean up the blood stains on my head, or I’ll keep looking
like a crime scene. It’s ﬁne scaring myself, but if I were to scare my sister,
Melissa, when she gets up early in the morning tomorrow, it would be
quite problematic!
The corridor outside was pitch black. Silhouettes were barely
accentuated by the crimson moonlight from the window at the end of
the corridor. They looked like a pair of monster eyes that silently
observed the living late into the night.
Zhou Mingrui lightened his footsteps as he walked towards the
communal bathroom with a shuddering fear.
When he entered, there was even more moonlight, allowing him to
see everything clearly. Zhou Mingrui stood in front of a wash basin
and turned the tap’s knob.
Upon hearing the gushing sound of water, he suddenly recalled his
landlord, Mr. Franky.
As water was included in the rent, this short and thin gentleman who
wore a top hat, a vest, and a black suit, always inspected the
bathroom actively to take note of any sounds of ﬂowing water.
If the water gushed too loudly, Mr. Franky would ignore all of his
gentlemanly traits by ﬂailing his walking stick and striking the
bathroom’s door, shouting things like ‘Darn thief,’ ‘Wastage is a
shameless matter,’ ‘I’ll remember you,’ ‘If I see this happen another
time, scram along with your ﬁlthy luggage,’ ‘Mark my words, this is
the most value-for-money apartment in Tingen City. You will not ﬁnd
a more kindly landlord anywhere else!’
Putting away those thoughts, Zhou Mingrui used a moist towel to
clean the blood stains from his face again and again.
After checking himself using the rundown mirror in the bathroom
and verifying that all that was left were a hideous wound and a pale
face did Zhou Mingrui relax. Then, he took oﬀ his linen shirt and
used a bar of soap to wash away the bloodstains.
At that moment, he knitted his brows and recalled of a possible
problem.
The wound was too exaggerated and there was too much blood.
Apart from his body, his room likely still had signs of his injury!
After Zhou Mingrui was done with his linen shirt a few minutes later,
he briskly returned to his apartment with a moist towel. He ﬁrst
wiped the blood handprint on the desk and then, using the gas lamp’s
illumination, sought out spots which he missed out.
He immediately discovered that quite a substantial amount of blood
had splattered onto the ﬂoor beneath the desk. And there was a
yellow bullet to the left side of the wall.
“Releasing a round with a revolver pointed at the temple?” After
mixing and matching the clues from before, Zhou Mingrui had a
rough idea how Klein had died.
He was in no hurry to verify his guess. Instead, he seriously wiped
away the blood stains and cleaned up the ‘scene.’ Following that, he
took the bullet and returned to the side of his desk. He opened the
revolver’s cylinder and poured out the rounds inside.
A total of ﬁve rounds and a cartridge shell all had a brass luster to
them.
“Indeed…” Zhou Mingrui looked at the empty cartridge shell in front
of him and stuﬀed the rounds back into the cylinder while nodding.
He shifted his gaze to the left and it landed on the notebook’s words:
‘Everyone will die, including me.’ Following that, even more
questions arose in him.
Where did the gun come from?
Was it suicide or a faked suicide?
What kind of trouble could a history graduate of humble origins get
himself into?
Why would such a suicide method only leave behind so little blood? Was
it because I transmigrated in a timely manner and it came with healing
beneﬁts?
After pondering for a moment, Zhou Mingrui changed into another
linen shirt. He sat on the chair and began pondering over more
important matters.
Klein’s experience was still not something he needed to concern
himself with. The true problem was to ﬁgure out the reason for his
transmigration and if he could return!
His parents, relatives, best buddies, and friends. The fascinating
world of the Internet and all sorts of delicious delicacies… These
were reasons that prompted his desire to return!
Click. Click. Click… Zhou Mingrui’s right hand was subconsciously
pulling out the revolver’s cylinder and slamming it back into place,
again and again.
Yea, there has not been much diﬀerence for me between this period of
time and the past. I was just a little unlucky, but why would I transmigrate
for no baﬄing reason?
Bad luck… Yes, I tried a luck enhancement ritual before dinner today!
A thought ﬂashed in Zhou Mingrui’s mind, illuminating the memories
which were concealed by a fog of confusion.
As a qualiﬁed keyboard politician, keyboard historian, keyboard
economist, keyboard biologist, and keyboard folklorist, he had
always deemed himself as ‘knowing something of everything.’ Of
course, his best buddy would often mock him as ‘only knowing a
little of everything.’
And one of them was Chinese Divination.
When he visited his hometown last year, he had discovered a thread-
bound book titled ‘Quintessential Divination and Arcane Arts of the
Qin and Han Dynasty’ at an old bookstore. It looked pretty interesting
and could aid him in posturing on the Internet, so he bought it.
Unfortunately, his interest was short-lived. The vertical script it used
made the reading experience horrible. All he did was ﬂip through the
beginning pages before he threw it into a corner.
He had experienced a spate of bad luck in the past month—losing his
cell phone, customers running away after cheating him, and mistakes
at work. Only then did he suddenly recall the luck enhancement
ritual written at the beginning of ‘Quintessential Divination and
Arcane Arts.’ Furthermore, the requirements were extremely simple,
without any basic foundation requirements.
All he needed was to get four portions of the staple food in his area
and place them in the four corners of his room. They could be placed
on furniture such as tables and cupboards. Then, standing in the
middle of the room, he had to take four steps in a counter-clockwise
fashion to make a square. The ﬁrst step required him to sincerely
chant ‘Blessings Stem From The Immortal Lord of Heaven and Earth.’
The second step was to silently chant, ‘Blessings Stem From The Sky
Lord of Heaven and Earth.’ The third step was ‘Blessings Stem From
The Exalted Thearch of Heaven and Earth,’ and the fourth step was
‘Blessings Stem From The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth.’
After the four steps were taken, he needed to close his eyes and wait
ﬁve minutes in his original spot. Only then would the ritual be
considered complete.
Since it did not cost him any money, he found the book, followed
what was stipulated, and did it before dinner. However… nothing
happened back then.
Who would have guessed that he would actually transmigrate in the
middle of the night!
Transmigration!
“There is a distinct possibility that it’s due to that luck enhancement
ritual… Yes, I should give it a try here tomorrow. If it’s really
because of that, I stand a chance of transmigrating back!” Zhou
Mingrui stopped ﬂicking the revolver’s cylinder and suddenly sat
straight up.
Regardless, he had to give it a try!
He had to attempt a Hail Mary!
Chapter 3: Melissa
After conﬁrming his plan, Zhou Mingrui immediately felt he had a
mental crutch. His fear and unease were all swept away into a corner
of his mind.
Only then did he had the mood to carefully study Klein’s memory
fragments.
Zhou Mingrui habitually stood up before turning oﬀ the pipe’s valve.
He watched the wall lamp gradually dim until its ﬂame extinguished
before sitting back down. As he subconsciously ﬁddled with the
revolver’s brass cylinder, he pressed the side of his head. He slowly
recalled his memories in the crimson-dyed darkness as though he was
the most attentive viewer in a movie theater.
Perhaps as a result of having a bullet pass through his head, Klein’s
memories were like shattered glass. Not only were the memories not
contiguous, there were many spots which were clearly missing. For
example, memories pertaining to how the exquisite revolver
appeared in his possession, whether he had committed suicide, or
was killed, as well as the meaning of the words ‘Everyone will die,
including me’ on the notebook, or whether he had participated in
anything odd two days before the incident.
Not only had these particular memories become fragmented, there
were also missing pieces. It was the same even for knowledge he
ought to know. In light of the present situation, Zhou Mingrui
believed that if Klein were to return to university, it was unlikely he
could graduate. This was despite him having left campus just days
ago without relaxing one bit.
He needs to participate in the Tingen University’s History department
interview two days later…
The university graduates of Loen Kingdom do not have the tradition of
staying at their alma mater… His mentor had given him a
recommendation letter for Tingen University and Backlund University…
…
Through the window, Zhou Mingrui silently observed the red moon
setting in the west. The gradual sinking of the moon continued until
faint light glowed from the east, dyeing the horizon golden.
At that moment, there was a commotion inside the apartment. Soon,
the sound of footsteps approached his door.
“Melissa is awake… She’s really as punctual as always.” Zhou
Mingrui smiled. Due to Klein’s memories, seeing Melissa made him
feel as though she was really his younger sister.
However, I do not have a younger sister… He immediately contradicted
himself.
Melissa was diﬀerent from Benson and Klein. Her rudimentary
education was not completed at the Sunday school classes oﬀered by
the Church of the Evernight Goddess. When she reached schooling
age, the Loen Kingdom had enacted the ‘Basic Education Law.’ A
Primary and Secondary Education Committee was established and
was specially provided with funding, increasing the kingdom’s
investment into education.
In less than three years, under the premise that numerous church
schools would be incorporated, many public primary schools were
established to strictly maintain the principle of religious neutrality.
This was to prevent education from involving itself in the conﬂicts
between the Lord of Storms, Evernight Goddess, and the God of
Steam and Machinery.
Compared to Sunday school that only cost a copper penny a week, a
public primary school’s cost of three pence a week appeared rather
expensive. However, the former only provided education every
Sunday, whereas the latter provided six days of classes a week. In
conclusion, the price was so low that it was almost free.
Melissa was diﬀerent from most girls. From a young age, she enjoyed
things like gears, springs, and bearings. Her ambition was to be a
steam mechanic.
Having suﬀered from a lack of culture, Benson, who knew the
importance of education, supported his sister’s dreams just like how
he supported Klein’s university education. After all, Tingen Technical
School was only considered secondary education. There was no need
for her to attend language school or a public school for more
knowledge.
In July last year, ﬁfteen-year-old Melissa passed her entrance
examinations and fulﬁlled her dreams of becoming a student at the
Tingen Technical School’s Steam and Machinery department. As such,
her weekly school fees raised to nine pence.
Meanwhile, Benson’s company was aﬀected by the situation in the
Southern Continent. There was a drastic drop both in proﬁt and
business transactions. More than a third of the employees were
retrenched. In order to keep his job and maintain their livelihood,
Benson could only accept more arduous tasks. He had to work
overtime more frequently or head to places with harsh environments.
That was what he was occupied with the past few days.
It was not that Klein did not think of helping share his elder brother’s
burden but being born a commoner and having been admitted into
an average language school, he felt a strong sense of inadequacy
when he enrolled into university. For example, as the origin of all
languages in the Northern Continent, the ancient language of Feysac
was something all the children of nobles and of the wealthy class
would learn from a young age. In contrast, he only made ﬁrst contact
with it in university.
He faced many similar aspects during his schooling career. Klein
nearly gave his all and often stayed up late into the night and woke
up early before barely managing to catch up to the others, eventually
allowing him to graduate with average results.
Memories regarding his elder brother and younger sister remained
active in Zhou Mingrui’s mind until he turned the doorknob open.
Only then did he jolt awake and remember that he held a revolver in
his hand.
This was a semi-regulated item!
It will scare children!
Also, there’s still the wound on my head!
With Melissa arriving at any moment, Zhou Mingrui pressed onto his
temple and hurriedly pulled open a desk drawer and threw the
revolver in before slamming it close.
“What happened?” Melissa looked over curiously when she heard the
commotion.
She was still in the prime of her youth. Even though she did not have
much nutritious food to eat, making her face thin and slightly pale,
her skin remained lustrous as it exuded the vibes of a young girl.
When Zhou Mingrui saw his sister’s brown eyes look over, he forcibly
composed himself and picked up an item beside his hand before
calmly closing the drawer to conceal the existence of the revolver. He
placed his other hand on his temple, the texture conﬁrming that his
wound had already healed!
He took out a silver vine-leaf pocket watch and pressed the top
gently, causing its cover to ﬂip open.
It was a picture of the siblings’ father. It was the most valuable item
the Royal Army sergeant left behind, but being a second-hand item, it
would often malfunction from time to time in recent years even
though he had gotten a watchsmith to ﬁx it. It had embarrassed
Benson who enjoyed bringing it with him to elevate his status many a
time, so it was thrown away back at home in the end.
It had to be said that perhaps Melissa did have talent in machinery.
After grasping the principles behind the watch, she borrowed the
tools from her Technical School to ﬁddle with the pocket watch.
Recently, she even claimed to have ﬁxed it!
Zhou Mingrui looked at the watch’s open cover and saw that the
second hand was not moving. Subconsciously, he twisted the top dial
to wind the pocket watch.
However, despite winding it a few times, he did not hear the sound of
taut springs. The second hand remained motionless.
“It looks like it’s broken again.” He looked at his sister while trying to
ﬁnd a topic of conversation.
Melissa shot him an expressionless glance and briskly walked over to
take the pocket watch away.
She stood in her spot and pulled up the button sitting atop the pocket
watch. With a few simple turns, the tick-tocking of the second hand
sounded.
Isn’t pulling the button up usually meant to adjust the time… Zhou
Mingrui’s expression immediately turned blank.
At that moment, a bell chimed from a faraway cathedral. It chimed
six times, sounding distant and ethereal.
Melissa tilted her head to listen to it and pulled the button up once
again. Following that, she turned it to synchronize the time.
“It’s okay now,” she said simply without emotion. She then pressed
the top button back and handed the pocket watch back to Zhou
Mingrui.
Zhou Mingrui returned a smile politely in embarrassment.
Melissa gave her elder brother a piercing stare before turning to walk
to the cupboard. She took her toiletries and towel before opening the
door to leave. She headed for the public bathroom.
Why did her expression have a look of disparagement and resignation?
Is it a look of love and concern for a retarded brother?
Zhou Mingrui lowered his head and chuckled. He closed the pocket
watch’s cover with a click before opening it again.
He repeated this action as his idle thoughts focused on a question.
Klein committed suicide without a silencer. Well, I’ll consider it as suicide
for now. His suicide should have caused quite a commotion; yet, Melissa,
who was just a wall away, did not notice it at all.
Was she sleeping too soundly? Or is Klein’s suicide shrouded in mystery to
begin with?
Click! The pocket watch opened. Clack! The pocket watch closed…
Melissa returned from washing up and saw her brother’s
subconscious act of constantly opening and closing the pocket watch.
Her gaze was once again glazed with exasperation as she said with a
sweet voice, “Klein, take out all the remaining bread. Remember to
buy fresh ones today. There’s meat and peas too. Your interview is
soon. I’ll make you mutton stewed with peas.”
As she spoke, she moved a stove out from a corner. With some
charcoal, she boiled a pot of hot water.
Before the water boiled, she opened the cupboard’s lowest drawer
and took out what seemed like a treasure—a can of inferior tea
leaves. She threw about ten leaves into the pot and pretended that it
was real tea.
Melissa poured two big cups of tea as she shared two pieces of rye
bread with Zhou Mingrui over tea.
There is no sawdust or excessive gluten mixed in, but it is unappetizing…
Zhou Mingrui still felt weak and was starving. He forced himself to
swallow the bread with the tea while complaining inwardly.
Melissa ﬁnished eating a few minutes later. After she adjusted her
black hair that reached down to her vest, she looked at Zhou Mingrui
and said, “Remember to buy fresh bread. All we need is eight pounds.
The weather is hot, so the bread will easily spoil. Also, buy the
mutton and peas. Remember to buy them!”
Indeed, she was showing concern for her dull brother. She even had to
repeat to emphasize it another time… Zhou Mingrui nodded with a
smile.
“Alright.”
Regarding the Loen Kingdom’s pound, Zhou Mingrui matched Klein’s
muscle memory with his. He believed it was close to half a kilogram
of what he was accustomed to.
Melissa did not say anything further. She stood up and tidied the
area. After packing away the last bit of bread for lunch, she put on a
tattered veil cap that their mother left behind, picked up a self-sewn
bag used to carry her books and stationery, and prepared to leave.
It was not Sunday, so she had an entire day of classes to attend.
Walking from their apartment to Tingen Technical School took about
ﬁfty minutes. There were public horse carriages that cost a penny a
kilometer with a limit of four pence in the city and six pence in the
city outskirts. In order to save money, Melissa would leave ahead of
time and walk to school.
Moments after she opened the main door, she paused in her footsteps
and turned her body halfway, saying, “Klein, don’t buy too much
mutton or peas. Benson might come back on Sunday. Oh, and
remember we only need eight pounds of bread.”
“Alright. Sure thing,” answered Zhou Mingrui exasperatedly.
Simultaneously, he repeated the word ‘Sunday’ a few times in his
head.
In the Northern Continent, a year was similarly split into twelve
months. Every year, there was 365 or 366 days. A week was similarly
split into seven days.
The splitting of months was a result of astronomical observations. It
made Zhou Mingrui suspect whether he was in a parallel world. As
for the splitting of days, it was a result of religion. This was because
Northern Continent had seven orthodox gods—the Eternal Blazing
Sun, the Lord of Storms, the God of Knowledge and Wisdom, the
Evernight Goddess, Mother Earth, the God of War, and the God of
Steam and Machinery.
Watching his sister close the door and leave, Zhou Mingrui suddenly
sighed. Soon, his thoughts focused onto the luck enhancement ritual.
Sorry, I really wish to return home…
Chapter 4: Divination
Returning to his chair again, he heard the faraway cathedral’s bells
chime again. It continued seven times before Zhou Mingrui slowly
stood up. He went up front to the cupboard and took out his clothes.
A black vest with a matching suit, trousers that clung tightly to his
legs, a halved top hat and his faint scholarly air made Zhou Mingrui
feel like he was watching an English drama set in the Victorian era.
He suddenly muttered softly as he shook his head with a wry smile,
“I’m not going for an interview. All I’m doing is buying some
ingredients to prepare for my luck enhancement ritual…”
Klein was so concerned about his impending interview that it became
instinct. When he was not focused enough, he habitually wore his
only decent set of clothing.
After taking a breath, Zhou Mingrui took oﬀ his suit and vest,
switching to a brownish-yellow coat. He also changed to a felt hat
with a rounded edge of the same color.
With his outﬁt done, he walked to the side of the bed and lifted a
square cushion. He reached his hand into an inconspicuous hole
beneath and rummaged around before ﬁnding an intermediate layer.
When he retracted his right hand, there was a roll of notes in his
palm. There were about eight notes with faded dark green colors.
These were all the savings Benson had at the moment. It even
included the living expenses for the next three days. Two of them
were ﬁve-soli notes and the remaining were one-soli notes.
In the Loen Kingdom’s currency system, soli was ranked second. It
originated from ancient silver coins. One soli was equivalent to
twelve copper pence. They had denominations of one and ﬁve soli.
At the top of the currency system was the gold pound. They were also
paper based but were guaranteed by gold and pegged directly. A gold
pound was equivalent to twenty soli. They had denominations of one,
ﬁve, and ten gold pounds.
Zhou Mingrui spread a note and caught a whiﬀ of the faint unique
ink.
This was the smell of money.
Perhaps a result of Klein’s memory fragments or his constant desire
for money, Zhou Mingrui felt like he had instantly fallen in love with
these notes.
Look, their designs are so beautiful. It makes the stern and old-fashioned
George III and his two mustaches appear especially adorable…
Look, the watermark that can be seen when the note is placed against
sunlight is so alluring. The exquisite design for the anti-counterfeit label
makes it completely diﬀerent from those fake fancy schlocks!
Zhou Mingrui admired it for nearly a minute before pulling out two
one-soli notes. He then rolled up the remaining notes and stuﬀed
them back into the cushion’s concealed layer.
After arranging and ﬂattening the cloth around the hole, Zhou
Mingrui folded the two notes he had taken out neatly and placed
them into the left pocket of his brownish-yellow jacket. He separated
the notes from the few pence he had in his trouser pocket.
With all of this done, he placed a key into his right pocket and
brought a dark brownish paper bag along with him and quickly
walked toward the door.
His shuﬄing footsteps slowed down from a brisk pace until it
eventually stopped.
Zhou Mingrui stood by the door and was unsure when he had already
begun to frown.
Klein’s suicide was fraught with peculiarities. Would he encounter any
‘accidents’ if he were to leave just like that?
After some deep thought, Zhou Mingrui returned to his desk and
pulled open the drawer. He then took out the shimmering brass
revolver.
This was the only defensive weapon he could think of, and it was the
only weapon with suﬃcient power!
Although he had never practicing shooting, just pulling such a
revolver out would deﬁnitely daunt anyone!
He caressed the revolver’s cold metal before stuﬃng his revolver into
the pocket where his notes were. He clasped the money in his palm
as his ﬁngers pressed onto the gun’s handle. It was perfectly
concealed.
Feeling secure, he who knew a little of everything suddenly had a
worry.
Would I end up misﬁring?
Being deluged with such a thought, Zhou Mingrui quickly thought of
a solution. He drew the revolver and released the cylinder. He then
aligned the empty chamber which was a result of the ‘suicide’ along
the gun’s hammer before closing it.
This way, even if there was a misﬁre, he would discharge an ’empty
round!’
After stuﬃng his revolver back into his pocket, Zhou Mingrui kept his
left hand in there.
He pressed down on his hat with his right hand and pulled open the
door before leaving.
The corridor during the day remained dim as limited sunlight shone
in from the window situated at the end of the corridor. Zhou Mingrui
quickly went down the stairs and left the apartment before taking in
the brilliance and warmth of the sun.
Although it was almost July, it was still considered the middle of
summer. However, Tingen was situated north of the Loen Kingdom,
so it had unique climate characteristics. The highest annual
temperature was not even 30°C on Earth, with even cooler mornings.
However, the streets were awash with ﬁlthy water and strewn junk.
From Klein’s memories, this was not a rare sight in low-income
communities, even if there were sewers. After all, there were just too
many people and people needed to survive.
“Come and try our delicious roasted ﬁsh!”
“Hot and fresh oyster soup. Drink a bowl in the morning and feel
invigorated all day!”
“Fresh ﬁsh from the port for just ﬁve pence apiece!”
“Muﬃns and eel soup make the perfect combination!”
“Conch! Conch! Conch!”
“Vegetables freshly plucked from the farms outside the city. Cheap
and fresh!”
…
The mobile hawkers who sold vegetables, fruits, and hot food
shouted along the streets as they beckoned the rushing pedestrians.
Some of them would stop and carefully compare before purchasing.
Others would impatiently wave their hands as they had yet to ﬁnd
work for the day.
Zhou Mingrui took in a whiﬀ of the air that mixed both noxious and
fragrant aromas. As he clenched the revolver tightly in his left hand,
he held the notes tight. He pressed down on his hat with his right
hand while passing through the busy street, slouching a little.
There was bound to be thieves in populated areas. Furthermore, this
street had no lack of poor citizens who were working part time after
losing their previous jobs. There were also starving children that
were exploited by adults to do their bidding.
He proceeded forward until he reached a point where the
crowdedness around him restored to normal. He straightened his
back and raised his head to look down the street.
There was a vagrant accordionist busking. The melody was
sometimes pleasant, sometimes fervent.
Beside him were several children in ragged clothes with sallow
complexions due to malnutrition.
They listened to the music and moved to the beat, dancing self-made
choreographies. Their faces were ﬁlled with joy as though they were
a prince or an angel.
A deadpan woman passed by; her skirt was dirty and her skin was
dull.
Her gaze appeared dull and sluggish. Only when she looked at the
bunch of children did a faint glow ﬂash. It was as though she had
seen herself from three decades ago.
Zhou Mingrui overtook her and turned into another street before
stopping at Smyrin Bakery.
The owner of the bakery was a seventy-plus year old granny named
Wendy Smyrin. Her hair was completely grayish-white and she
always wore a genial smile. From the beginning of Klein’s memories,
she had been here selling bread and pastries.
Oh, the Tingen biscuits and lemon cakes she bakes are very delicious…
Zhou Mingrui gulped a mouthful of saliva and smiled.
“Mrs. Smyrin, eight pounds of rye bread.”
“Oh. Dear Klein, where’s Benson? Is he not back?” Wendy asked
smilingly.
“In a few more days,” answered Zhou Mingrui vaguely.
As Wendy took the rye bread, she sighed. “He sure is a hardworking
lad. He will have a good wife.”
Upon saying this, the corners of her lips curled up as she said
playfully, “All is good now. You have already graduated. You are a
history graduate of our Khoy University~ Oh, you will soon be able
to earn money. You should not be staying in the apartment you are
currently living in. At the very least, you should have a bathroom you
can call your own.”
“Mrs. Smyrin, you seem to be a young and energetic woman today.”
All Zhou Mingrui could do was respond with a dry smile.
If Klein were to successfully pass his interview and become a lecturer
at Tingen University, it was true that his family would immediately
be pushed up to a higher socioeconomic status!
In his memory fragments, he had once fantasized about renting a
bungalow in the suburbs. There would be ﬁve or six rooms, two
bathrooms, a huge balcony upstairs, two rooms, a dining room, a
living room, a kitchen, a bathroom, and an underground storage
room on the ﬁrst ﬂoor.
This was not a wishful dream. Even a lecturer on probation at Tingen
University would have a weekly salary of two gold pounds. After the
probationary period, the salary would be raised to three gold pounds
and ten soli. One had to know that despite working for so many
years, Klein’s brother, Benson, only had a weekly salary of one pound
and ten soli. Ordinary workers at a factory did not even get a pound
or, at best, a little more. And rent for a bungalow was about nineteen
soli to one pound and eighteen soli.
“This is the diﬀerence between earning three to four thousand yuan
and earning fourteen to ﬁfteen thousand yuan a month…” Zhou
Mingrui mumbled to himself.
However, all of this was under the premise that he passed either the
Tingen University or Backlund University interviews.
There were not many other opportunities. People without any
connections were unable to get recommendations to become a public
servant. And those who studied history were more limited in job
opportunities. There was not much demand for private consultants
from the aristocrats, banks, or industrial magnates.
Taking into account that the knowledge Klein grasped were
fragmented and incomplete, Zhou Mingrui felt awkward and guilty
towards Mrs. Smyrin’s expectations of him.
“No, I have always been this young,” answered Wendy humorously.
As she spoke, she packed the sixteen rye bread she had weighed into
the brown paper bag that Zhou Mingrui had brought. She stretched
out her right hand and said, “Nine pence.”
Every rye bread weighted about half a pound as diﬀerences were
inevitable.
“Nine pence? Wasn’t it eleven pence two days ago?” Zhou Mingrui
asked subconsciously.
It cost 15 pence the month before the previous month.
“You have to thank the people who protested on the streets for the
repeal of the Grain Act,” said Wendy as she shrugged.
Zhou Mingrui nodded in vague acknowledgment. Klein’s memories
regarding this was incomplete. All he remembered was that the core
tenet of the Grain Act was to protect the prices of domestic
agriculture products. Once the prices rose to a certain level, grain
imports from Southern nations like Feynapotter, Masin, Lenburg were
stopped.
Why would people protest the act?
Without saying much, Zhou Mingrui, afraid he would end up pulling
out the revolver, carefully took out his notes and handed one of them
over to Mrs. Smyrin.
He was given three copper pence in change. Stuﬃng them into his
trouser pocket, he took the paper bag containing the bread and
headed for the ‘Lettuce and Meat’ market across the street. He was
working hard for the mutton stewed with peas his sister had
exhorted.
There was a municipal square at the intersection of Iron Cross Street
and Daﬀodil Street. Many tents were erected there, and clowns
dressed in odd and funny attires were distributing ﬂiers.
“There’s a circus performance tomorrow night?” Zhou Mingrui
glanced at the ﬂiers in the hands of others as he read their contents
under his breath.
Melissa would deﬁnitely like it. However, how much is the entrance fee?
With that thought, Zhou Mingrui went closer.
Just as he was about to ask a clown with a red and yellow painted
face, a hoarse woman’s voice sounded from beside him.
“Would you like to try a divination?”
Zhou Mingrui subconsciously turned his head and saw a woman
wearing a pointed hat and a long black dress standing in front of a
short tent.
Her face was smeared with red and yellow paint and her eyes were a
profound grayish-blue.
“No,” Zhou Mingrui shook his head in response. He did not have the
spare cash for divination.
The woman laughed and said, “My tarot divination is very accurate.”
“Tarot…” Zhou Mingrui was instantly dumbfounded.
This pronunciation was almost identical to the tarot cards on Earth!
And tarot cards from Earth were a set of cards used for divination.
They just had graphics that represented diﬀerent omens.
Wait… He suddenly recalled the origins of tarot divination in this
world.
It did not originate from the seven orthodox gods nor was it an
ancient legacy. Instead, it was created by the Intis Republic’s Consul
of that era, Roselle Gusta, more than 170 years ago.
This Mr. Roselle invented the steam engine, improved the sailing
boat, overthrew the Intis Kingdom’s imperial rule, and was
recognized by the God of Craftsmanship. He also became the ﬁrst
Consul of the Intis Republic.
Later, he invaded other nations and placed Lenburg and other nations
under his protection. He made the Loen Kingdom, Feynapotter,
Feysac Empire and other powerful Northern Continent nations bow
down to the Intis Republic. Following that, the Republic was then
changed to an Empire and he became the self-proclaimed ‘Emperor
Caesar.’
It was during Roselle’s rule that the Church of Craftsmanship
received its ﬁrst public holy revelation since the Fifth Epoch. Ever
since, the God of Craftsmanship was changed to the God of Steam
and Machinery.
Roselle also invented tarot divination. He also established the
contemporary system of paper-based cards and their playstyles. There
were many familiar styles that Zhou Mingrui was familiar with, such
as Upgrade, Fighting the Landlord, Texas Poker, and Quint…
In addition, the marine ﬂeets he sent out discovered a sea route that
led to the Southern Continent through the stormy and turbulent seas.
This also began the era of colonialism.
Unfortunately, he was betrayed in his old age. In the year 1198 of the
Fifth Epoch, he was assassinated by the combined forces of the
Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun, the former Intis royal family—the
Sauron family, and other aristocrats. He eventually died in the White
Maple Palace.
This… To recall such general knowledge suddenly made him
facepalm.
Could this be a transmigration senior?
With this in mind, Zhou Mingrui was intrigued to see what tarot
cards looked like. Therefore, he nodded at the pointy hat woman
with the painted face and said, “If the… well… price is reasonable,
I’ll give it a try.”
The woman immediately said with a laugh, “Sir, you are the ﬁrst one
here today, so it’s on the house.”
Chapter 5: Ritual
Free? Free things cost the most!
Zhou Mingrui silently mumbled and decided that he would not
purchase any additional services whatever they were. He would
ﬁrmly refuse them all.
If you are really that capable, try divining that I transmigrated here!
With this in mind, Zhou Mingrui followed behind the woman whose
face was painted red and yellow, stooping low to enter the low tent.
The tent’s interior was extremely dark, illuminated only by several
beams of light that managed to seep inside. A table covered with
paper cards could be made out faintly in the low illumination.
The woman with the sharp pointy hat was not aﬀected by this at all.
Her long black dress glided as though it was moving over water while
she went around to the table. She sat on the opposite side and lighted
a candle.
The dim yellow light ﬂickered, causing the inside of the tent to
appear bright and dark at the same time. It instantly added a much
more mysterious feel to the atmosphere.
Zhou Mingrui sat down quietly, his gaze sweeping over the tarot
cards on the table where he discovered familiar cards like “The
Magician,” “The Emperor,” “The Hanged Man,” and “Temperance,”
etc.
Could Roselle have been a ‘senior’… I wonder if he was also a fellow
countryman of mine… Zhou Mingrui mumbled to himself
subconsciously.
Before he could ﬁnish looking at the opened cards on the table, the
woman who claimed to have accurate divinations had already
reached out her hands to gather all of the cards together. She stacked
them into a deck and pushed it in front of him.
“Shuﬄe the cards ﬁrst and cut the deck,” the circus fortune-teller
said in a muted voice.
“Me? Shuﬄe?” Zhou Mingrui asked reﬂexively.
The yellow and red paint on the fortune-teller’s face squirmed
together as she revealed a slight smile, saying, “Of course, everyone’s
destiny can only be unraveled by themselves. I only serve as a reader
of it.”
Zhou Mingrui immediately questioned her warily, “This reading does
not require additional fees, right?”
As a keyboard folklorist, I’ve already seen too many of such tricks!
The fortune-teller was visibly taken aback before ﬁnally saying
muﬄedly, “It’s free.”
Zhou Mingrui, relieved, stuﬀed the revolver further back into his
pocket. Thereafter, he calmly reached out his two hands to shuﬄe
and cut the deck skillfully.
“It’s done.” He placed the already shuﬄed tarot cards in the middle
of the table.
The fortune-teller clasped the cards with both her hands and carefully
looked at cards for a while. Then, she suddenly opened her mouth
and said, “I’m sorry, I forgot to ask, but what would you like to ask
about?”
Back when he was wooing his ﬁrst love, Zhou Mingrui had also done
research on tarot cards. He asked unhesitatingly, “Past, present, and
future.”
This was a type of divination as part of tarot card interpretation—
three cards when opened sequentially symbolized one’s past, present,
and future.
The fortune-teller nodded ﬁrst, then curled her lips to reveal a smile
and said, “Then please reshuﬄe the deck. You can only truly get the
cards you want if you know what you would like to ask about.”
Were you fooling me just now? Do you have to be this petty? Didn’t I only
ask a few times if this would be a free service? Zhou Mingrui’s cheeks
twitched a little. He took a deep breath and took the tarot deck back
to reshuﬄe and cut it.
“There won’t be any problems this time, right?” He placed the
already cut deck back onto the table.
“No problem.” The fortune-teller reached out her ﬁngers and picked a
card from the top of the deck. Then she placed it on the left side of
Zhou Mingrui. Her voice was going lower and lower as she spoke,
“This card symbolizes your past.”
“This card symbolize your present.” The fortune-teller placed the
second card right in front of Zhou Mingrui.
Then, she picked the third card and put it on the right side of Zhou
Mingrui.
“This card symbolizes the future.”
“Alright, which card would you like to see ﬁrst?” The fortune-teller
raised her head up after completing her placement of the cards and
gazed deeply at Zhou Mingrui with her grayish-blue eyes.
“I’ll have a look at the ‘present’ ﬁrst,” Zhou Mingrui said after giving
it some thought.
The fortune-teller nodded slowly and ﬂipped over the tarot card that
was directly in front of Zhou Mingrui.
A colorfully dressed character was depicted on this card, wearing
ragged headgear with a stick over his shoulder. There was a bindle
hanging on the end of the stick and a puppy was following behind
him. It was numbered “0.”
“The Fool,” the fortune-teller lightly read out the name of the card
with her grayish-blue eyes aﬃxed on Zhou Mingrui.
The Fool? The “0” card of tarot? A start? A fresh beginning with all kinds
of possibilities? Zhou Mingrui was not even considered an amateur
enthusiast of tarot, so he could only make a rough interpretation
based on his own impressions of tarot.
Just as the fortune-teller was about to say something, the cloth
curtains of the tent was suddenly lifted open. The ray of sunlight that
shone in was so blinding that it caused the back-facing Zhou Mingrui
to instinctively narrow his eyes.
“Why are you impersonating me again! It’s my job to handle the
divination for people!” a woman’s voice growled angrily. “Return to
your post quickly! You must remember that you’re just an animal
trainer!”
An animal trainer? Zhou Mingrui’s eyes had already adapted to the
light by now. He saw a similar-looking woman who was also wearing
a sharp pointy hat in a black dress, with her face painted in red and
yellow as well. The only diﬀerence was that she was taller and had a
slimmer physique.
The woman who was seating in front of him immediately stood up
and said disgruntledly, “Don’t mind this, it’s just that I like doing
this. But I have to say, my divination and interpretation can be really
accurate sometimes. I’m serious…”
She spoke and lifted up her dress to go around from the side of the
table before quickly trotting away from the tent.
“Sir, would you like me to interpret your cards for you?” the real
fortune-teller looked at Zhou Mingrui and asked with a smile.
Zhou Mingrui’s lips twitched and asked her sincerely, “Is it free?”
“…No,” the real fortune-teller answered.
“Then forget it.” Zhou Mingrui pulled his hands back and put them
into his pockets. He clutched his revolver and money before stooping
again to exit the tent.
Damn! He actually got an animal trainer to be his fortune-teller?
Was an animal trainer who didn’t want to be a fortune-teller not a good
clown?
Zhou Mingrui very quickly put this matter behind him. He spent
seven pence at the ‘Lettuce and Meat’ market for a pound of not-so-
great mutton. Then, he also bought some tender broad beans,
cabbage, onions, potatoes, and other items. Together with the bread
that he bought earlier, he spent a total of 25 copper pennies, which
converted to two soli and one pence.
“There is really not enough to go around for spending. Poor
Benson…” Not only had Zhou Mingrui spent the two notes that he
had brought with him, but it was also necessary for him top it up
with the one penny he had in his pocket.
He just sighed and did not think further about it as he hurried back
home.
With the staple food, he could now carry out the luck enhancement
ritual!
…
After the second-ﬂoor tenants gradually left, Zhou Mingrui was still
in no hurry to carry out the ritual. Instead, he translated the
“Blessings Stem From The Immortal Lord of Heaven and Earth” and
related phrases into the ancient Feysac language, as well as the Loen
language. He was intending to try the ritual again the next day in
those local languages if the original incantation did not take eﬀect!
After all, he had to take into consideration the diﬀerences between
the two worlds. In Rome, do as the Romans do!
As for translating it into an ancient ritual prayer that used the
dedicated Hermes language, Zhou Mingrui had a diﬃcult time
completing it due to his lack of vocabulary.
After readying everything, he ﬁnally took out the four loaves of rye
bread. He placed one in the corner where the coal stove was
originally, one at the bottom inner side of the dress mirror, one at the
top of the cupboard where two walls met, and one at the right side of
the study table where miscellaneous items were kept.
With a deep breath, Zhou Mingrui came to the center of the room
and spent a few minutes to calm himself. Then, he took a solemn step
forward and went in a counter-clockwise direction in the shape of a
square.
When he took the ﬁrst step, he chanted in a low whisper, “Blessings
Stem From The Immortal Lord of Heaven and Earth.”
The second step, he sincerely chanted, “Blessings Stem From The Sky
Lord of Heaven and Earth.”
The third step, Zhou Mingrui breathed out a whisper. “Blessings Stem
From The Exalted Thearch of Heaven and Earth.”
At the fourth step, he spat out a foul breath and meditated in
concentration. “Blessings Stem From The Celestial Worthy of Heaven
and Earth.”
When he returned back to the original spot, Zhou Mingrui closed his
eyes and waited in his place for an outcome. He had some
anticipation in him, some unease, some hope, and some fear.
Could he make it back?
Was there going to be any eﬀect?
Could there be some unexpected situation?
The unknown in front of him was tainted with the crimson light of
hope. Zhou Mingrui’s thoughts were swirling in his head and was
ﬁnding it diﬃcult to quell it.
It was at this time that he suddenly felt the surrounding air seem to
stop, becoming thick and mysterious.
Immediately after, a low whisper could be heard beside his ears that
sounded at times real, at times sharp, at times imaginary, at times
alluring, at times maniacal, and at times crazy.
He clearly did not understand the murmuring that went on, but Zhou
Mingrui still couldn’t help himself from wanting to listen to it and
distinguish what it was saying.
His head was in pain again. It was so painful that it felt like someone
had stuck a steel drill rod into it.
Zhou Mingrui only felt like his head was going to explode. His
thoughts were ﬁlled with a psychedelic of colors.
He knew that something was wrong and tried to open his eyes.
However, he wasn’t even able to complete such a simple action.
His entire body was getting tighter and tighter and it felt like he
could just break apart at any time. At this time, a self-mocking
thought came up in Zhou Mingrui’s mind:
“If you didn’t seek death, you wouldn’t die…”
He could no longer bear with it. Just as his mind was going to break,
the murmuring of voices faded away and his surroundings became
very quiet. The mood was an erratic one.
It was not only the mood; Zhou Mingrui felt his own body going
through the same sensations as well.
He tried once more to open his eyes, an extremely easy task this time.
A gray fog appeared over his eyes—haziness, vague, and endless.
“What’s with this situation?” Zhou Mingrui suddenly looked around
him and then lowered his head down to discover that he was ﬂoating
at the edge of an endless fog.
The fog was ﬂowing like water and was dotted with a lot of crimson
‘stars.’ Some of them were enormous while others were tiny. There
was a sense of them being hidden in the deep depths, while others
ﬂoated over the surface of this water-like fog.
Looking at the seemingly holographic sight, Zhou Mingrui reached
out his right hand in a half-confused, half-exploring manner to try to
touch the crimson ‘star’ that was seemingly ﬂoating on the surface.
He was trying to ﬁnd a way to leave this place.
When his hand touched the surface of that star, a water mark
suddenly appeared from within his body and agitated the stars into a
“crimson” burst. It looked like a dreamlike burning of ﬂames.
Zhou Mingrui got a fright from it. He retracted his right hand in a
panic, but accidentally touched yet another crimson star.
As a result, this star burst with splendid light as well.
In turn, Zhou Mingrui felt his mind empty and his spirit dissipated.
…
In the Loen Kingdom’s capital, Backlund. Inside a luxurious looking
villa at the royal district.
Audrey Hall sat in front of a dresser. The markings on it were
antiquated and there was a cracked bronze mirror on the surface.
“Mirror, mirror, awaken…
“In the name of the Hall family, I command you to awaken!”
…
She switched between many diﬀerent sayings, but there was no
reaction from the mirror at all.
After more than 10 minutes, she ﬁnally chose to give up and pouted
her lips in grievance. She said in a soft murmur, “Father was indeed
lying to me. He always tells me that this mirror was the treasure of
the Roman Empire’s Dark Emperor, and that it is an extraordinary
item…”
Her voice trailed oﬀ. The bronze mirror which rested on the dresser
suddenly glowed with a crimson light that shrouded her completely.
…
In the Sonia Sea, a three-masted sailboat that looked like an obvious
relic was navigating through a storm.
Alger Wilson stood on deck, his body undulating with the currents at
sea, maintaining his balance easily.
He wore a robe embroidered with lightning patterns, and in his hand
was a quirky-shaped glass bottle. Bubbles billowed inside the bottle
at times, frost turned into snow at times, and signs of gusting wind
could be seen at times.
“We’re still short on the Ghost Shark’s blood…” Alger murmured.
Then at this moment, a crimson burst appeared in the space between
the glass bottle and the surface of his palm. In an instant, it
enveloped the surroundings as well.
…
In the fog of gray mist, Audrey Hall regained her sight. She started
reckoning the situation in a state of horror and confusion when she
noticed the blurry image of a man on the opposite side of her doing
the same as well.
Immediately after, the both of them discovered another mystery
person standing not far from them who was shrouded in a gray mist.
The ‘mysterious person’ was none other than Zhou Mingrui. He was
similarly dumbfounded.
“Sir, where is this?”
Audrey and Alger were startled at ﬁrst, falling silent in the process.
Then, they immediately started speaking in unison.
“What are you planning on doing?”
Chapter 6: Beyonder
Not only did they speak the same Loen language, they also shared the
same grim and tense vibes.
Where am I? What do I plan to do here? I would like to know too…
Calming himself down, Zhou Mingrui silently repeated the questions
posed by the two.
What left the deepest impression on him were neither the sentences
formed by words nor the meanings behind them, but the display of
bewilderment, vigilance, panic, and reverence by the couple!
For some baﬄing reason, two people had been mysteriously dragged
into this world surrounded by gray fog. As the perpetrator, Zhou
Mingrui was already feeling abnormally dumbfounded and startled,
let alone the couple who was pulled into this mess completely
passively!
For them, such events and encounters might already be beyond their
imaginations, right?
Momentarily, Zhou Mingrui thought of two options: The ﬁrst option
was feigning victimhood to hide his true identity, and in turn gain a
considerable amount of trust. He could then take a wait-and-see
approach and take advantage of his circumstances where necessary.
The other option was to maintain his mysterious identity in the eyes
of the couple. He could then aﬀect the subsequent development while
gleaning valuable information from them.
Without the luxury of time to deliberate over the situation, he
grasped hold of the thought that ﬂashed across his mind. He made an
immediate decision to try out the second idea.
Exploit the psychological state of the others to gain the greatest
advantage for himself!
After a few seconds of silence in the fog, Zhou Mingrui chuckled.
With a low but not heavy tone, he calmly spoke as though he was
replying to the polite greetings from the visitors, “An attempt.”
An attempt… an attempt? Audrey Hall looked at the mysterious guy
veiled in the grayish-white fog, and the only thought was that
whatever was happening was absurd, funny, horrifying, and weird.
She was at the dressing table inside her bedroom only moments ago.
But just by turning around, she had “come” into this place that was
ﬁlled with gray fog!
How inconceivable!
Audrey took a breath, revealing an impeccable, courteous smile. She
asked in a somewhat perturbed way, “Sir, is the attempt over? Might
you permit our return?”
Alger Wilson also had the intentions to probe Zhou Mingrui in a
similar fashion, but his rich experience made him statelier. He held
back his impulse and only took on the role of a silent onlooker.
Zhou Mingrui looked at the questioner. Looking through the hazy
mist, he could roughly see the silhouette of the person in question. It
was a tall girl with smooth blond hair, but her exact countenance
could not be seen clearly.
He did not rush to reply the girl’s question but turned around to look
at the man. He had messy dark-blue hair, as well as a medium stature
that was not considered stout.
Zhou Mingrui suddenly realized something. Once he became stronger
or had a deeper understanding of the foggy world, perhaps it was
possible for him to see through the fog and discern the girl and the
man.
In this situation, they are the visitors, and I’m the master!
After changing his mindset, Zhou Mingrui instantly noticed details
that he had neglected earlier on.
The girl with a melodious voice and the mature, withdrawn man both
looked considerably incorporeal. Tainted by a faint crimson red, they
resembled a projected image of the two crimson red “stars” beyond
the gray fog.
This projection was based on the connection between the crimson red
and himself, an intangible connection that only he himself could
realistically grasp hold of.
The projection would disappear once the connection was cut, and the
couple would then return… Zhou Mingrui nodded mildly and looked
at the blond, chuckling. “Of course, if you make a formal request, you
can return this very moment.”
When she did not identify any ill intention from his tone, Audrey
heaved a sigh of relief. She believed that since a gentleman who was
capable of such miraculous things had given his word, he would
deﬁnitely abide by it stringently.
With her mind somewhat molliﬁed, she surprisingly was in no hurry
to request her leave. She rolled her virid eyes left and right, which
sparkled with an abnormal radiance.
She said in an anxious, anticipative and tempted manner, “This is
such a wonderful experience… Yes, I have always been hoping that
something like this would happen. I mean—I like mysteries and
supernatural miracles. No, my point is—what I mean is that, Sir,
what can I do to become a Beyonder?”
She got more excited as she spoke, so much so she was fumbling over
her words. The dream that sprouted in her as a result of listening to
thrilling fantasies as told by her elders ﬁnally saw the possibility of
being materialized.
However, with just a few words, she had already forgotten all her
previous fears and horrors.
Good question! I would also like to know the answer… Zhou Mingrui
complained inwardly.
He started to ponder on an answer to the question to maintain his
unfathomable image.
At the same time, he felt that it was quite unbecoming of him to talk
while standing. Shouldn’t he be in a palace, sitting at the head of a
long table, and on a mysterious high-back chair engraved with
ancient patterns, while silently observing his visitors?
As soon as this thought surfaced, the gray fog started to churn, giving
both Audrey and Alger a shock.
In an instant, they saw a number of towering stone pillars around
them. Above them was a vast dome that encapsulated them.
This entire ediﬁce looked magniﬁcent, grand and lofty, just like a
legendary palace for giants.
Directly under the dome where the gray fog gathered, a long, bronze
table appeared with ten high-back chairs on either side in a
symmetrical arrangement. The back of each chair dazzled and shone
faintly with crimson red, drawing the outlines of weird constellations
that diﬀered from reality.
Audrey and Alger sat face-to-face, sitting next to the Seat of Honor.
The girl looked to her sides, and could not help but mumble, “How
fascinating…”
It is certainly fascinating… Zhou Mingrui extended his right hand and
caressed the edge of the bronze table a little while maintaining an
unperturbed expression.
Alger inspected the surroundings, and after a few seconds of silence,
he suddenly opened his mouth, and answered Audrey’s question in
place of Zhou Mingrui.
“Are you a Loen?
“If you want to become a Beyonder, join the Churches of either the
Evernight Goddess, the Lord of Storms, or the God of Steam and
Machinery.
“The majority of us will not meet a Beyonder our entire lives. This
has caused churches, and even some clergies within some of the
biggest churches, to suspect the same. While this is the case, I am
certain to tell you that Beyonders still exist in courts, tribunals, and
execution agencies. They are still ﬁghting against the dangers that
grow in the dark, only that their numbers are much fewer as
compared to before and during the early days of the Iron Age.”
Zhou Mingrui listened attentively, but he tried his best to present
himself as paying little attention to Alger’s words, much like how
young kids listened to stories.
Relying on Klein’s fragmented general knowledge of history, Zhou
Mingrui knew clearly that the “Iron Age” referred to the current
epoch, which was the Fifth Epoch that began 1349 years ago.
Audrey silently listened to Alger ﬁnish his sentence before sighing.
“Mister, I know all about what you just said; I even know more than
that, including the Nighthawks, the Mandated Punisher, and the
Machinery Hivemind, but I don’t want to lose my freedom.”
Alger gave a low-sounding laugh, and said vaguely, “You can’t
become a Beyonder without sacriﬁces. If you don’t consider joining
churches and accepting their given challenges, you can only seek the
royal families and the few nobles with family histories of more than a
thousand years. If not, you can rely on your luck to search for
clandestine evil organizations.”
Audrey puﬀed her cheeks subconsciously and looked around in a
ﬂuster. After conﬁrming that both the “mysterious man” and Audrey
did not notice her tic, she pressed, “Are there no other solutions?”
Alger sank into silence. About half a minute later, he turned around
to look at the “mysterious man” who was watching the two of them
in silence.
Realizing that Zhou Mingrui had no plans to make any comment, he
looked back at Audrey and said with deliberation, “I have two sets of
Sequence 9 Potion formulas.”
Sequence 9? Zhou Mingrui muttered to himself.
“Really? Which two sets?” Audrey clearly knew what the Sequence 9
Potion formulas meant.
Alger leaned back slightly, and replied unhurriedly, “As you know,
humanity can only depend on potions to become real Beyonders,
while the names of potions come from the ‘Blasphemy Slate.’ After
constant translations intoJotun 1 , Elvish, ancient and modern
Hermes, and ancient Feysac, they have undergone changes to match
the day and age of that era. The essence is not in their names, but
whether they portray the ‘core characteristics’ of the potions.
“I have a Sequence 9 Potion named ‘Sailor.’ It enables you to have
excellent balancing capabilities. Even if you were on a boat in a
rainstorm, you will be able to walk about freely as though you were
on land. You will also gain immense strength and illusory scales
under your skin. They will enable you to swim like a ﬁsh and be
diﬃcult to catch. You will move agilely underwater just like marine
animals. Even without any equipment, you will be able to easily
submerge underwater for at least ten minutes.”
“Sounds great… the ‘Keepers of the Seas’ from the Lord of Storms?”
“It was called by that name in the past.” Alger did not pause and
continued. “The second set of Sequence 9 Potions is called
‘Spectator,’ although I am not sure what it was called in the past. This
set of potions enables you to have an exceptionally sharp mind with
acute observational abilities. I believe you can understand by what
‘spectator’ means from watching operas and plays. Just like an
audience, spectators judge the ‘actors’ in the secular world, catching
a glimpse of the real thoughts of them through their emotions,
conduct, and mantras.”
At this point, Alger emphasized, “You must remember, regardless of
whether you are at an extravagant banquet or a crowded street,
spectators can only be spectators forever.”
Audrey’s eyes shone as she listened, and spoke after a long while,
“Why? Alright, this is a follow-up question. I-I think I have fallen in
love with this feeling—of being a ‘spectator.’ How can I get this
potion’s formula? What can I use to trade with you for it?”
Alger looked like he was already prepared as he said in a deep voice,
“The blood of Ghost Sharks, at least 100 milliliters of it.”
Audrey nodded her head excitedly, but subsequently asked worriedly,
“If I can get it—and I’m saying if—how do I hand it to you? How can
you promise me that you can give the potion’s formula to me in
return for the Ghost Shark’s blood, as well as the authenticity of the
formula?”
Alger said calmly, “I’ll give you an address. I’ll mail the formula to
you, or tell you directly here, once I receive the blood of the Ghost
Shark.”
“As for promises, I think that both you and I can feel rest assured
under the witness of the mysterious sir.”
As he said this, he swept his eyes towards Zhou Mingrui who was
sitting up straight at the Seat of Honor.
“Sir, the fact that you brought us here shows that you have
tremendous strength unimaginable to us. Neither one of us would
dare violate a promise with you as witness.”
“That’s right!” Audrey’s eyes sparkled and agreed with excitement.
From her perspective, the mysterious gentleman who had
unimaginable abilities was deﬁnitely an “authoritative” witness.
How could I or the guy opposite me dare trick him!
Audrey half-turned her body and looked at Zhou Mingrui earnestly.
“Sir, please be the witness of our trade.”
At that moment, she then realized that she was all too impolite,
having forgotten all along to ask a particular question. She asked
hurriedly, “Sir, how should we address you?”
Alger nodded slightly, and echoed the same question in a serious
manner, “Sir, how should we address you?”
Zhou Mingrui was taken aback. He gently rapped his ﬁngers on the
bronze table. The contents of the earlier divination ﬂashed across his
mind suddenly.
He leaned back, withdrew his right hand, and crossed his ten ﬁngers,
placing them below his chin. He gave the duo a faint smile.
“You can address me as…”
Upon saying this, he paused for a moment. He said amiably and
calmly, “The Fool.”
Chapter 7: Call Sign
“You can address me as The Fool.”
The simple answer soon emanated through the grand hall and
dissipated into the fog. However, the voice kept resonating in
Audrey’s and Alger’s hearts, stirring up one ripple after another.
They never expected such a designation, but they felt that he was
deserving of it. The designation perfectly embodied his image as
someone mysterious, powerful, and bizarre!
After a few seconds of silence, Audrey stood up, held up her skirt
slightly and bent her knees, curtseying to Zhou Mingrui.
“Honorable Mr. Fool, would you please permit me to take the liberty
of requesting you to be the witness of our trade?”
“It’s nothing.” Zhou Mingrui’s mind whirred as he answered in a way
that matched his status.
“It’s our honor, Mr. Fool.” Alger stood up as well. He bent his back
slightly with his right palm over his chest.
Zhou Mingrui lowered his right palm and smiled.
“Continue, the both of you.”
Alger nodded and sat back down before looking at Audrey.
“If you can obtain the Ghost Shark’s blood, get someone to send it to
the Warrior & Sea Bar at Pelican Street, in the White Rose Borough of
Pritz Harbor. Tell the boss, Williams, that it’s what the ‘Captain’
wants.
“Once I acknowledge receipt, will you be giving me an address to
mail the potion formula to or do you want me to tell it to you here
directly?”
Audrey thought for a moment before saying with a smile, “I will
choose the more secure method. Let’s do it here, although it’s a test
of my memory.”
Since Mr. Fool had agreed to bear witness for the trade, it also
represented that there would be a similar ‘Gathering’ the next time.
With this in mind, she suddenly turned her head as she looked at
Zhou Mingrui with sparkling eyes. With a tone of interest, she
suggested, “Mr. Fool, would you mind making a few more ‘attempts’
like this?”
Alger listened to her suggestion calmly; he was tempted by the
suggestion as well. He hurriedly echoed, “Mr. Fool, don’t you ﬁnd
such ‘Gatherings’ interesting? Although your powers exceed our
imaginations, there has to be certain domains that you don’t
understand or excel in. The person across me is obviously a young
lady of lofty stature. I also have my unique set of experiences,
insights, mediums, and resources. Perhaps there will come a day
when both of us can help you complete something trivial that might
be inconvenient for you.”
From his point of view, the fact that he had been pulled into this
space without any warning or any means to resist meant that the
mysterious Mr. Fool was in control. Participating in the ‘Gatherings’
was not necessarily something he could refuse. Therefore, it was
better to reap the beneﬁts of this encounter as much as he could to
make up for his passive and disadvantaged state.
The trio at the long table had diﬀerent backgrounds, resources,
information channels, and comprehension of the mystical domain. If
they interacted and enjoyed some limited cooperation, they could
produce unpredictable and immeasurable eﬀects!
The resource trade that had just been negotiated was one example.
Another example would be if he wished to kill someone. He could
easily request the Gathering’s members who did not appear to be
related to him both on the surface and in reality for help. He could
perfectly misdirect any investigators.
A young lady of lofty stature… Was my behavior and accent that
obvious? Audrey stared blankly, mouth slightly agape, but she soon
jolted back to her senses and nodded her head without any
hesitation.
“Mr. Fool, I think it’s a very good suggestion. As long as this
Gathering becomes regular, you can totally leave certain things that
are inconvenient for you to us. Of course, it has to be something
within our capacities.”
From the moment he heard the suggestion, Zhou Mingrui was already
weighing the pros and cons. More gatherings deﬁnitely allowed him
to gain more knowledge of the secrets of the Beyonders or other
mysteries, a boon for his transmigration back. For example, it was
likely that the potion formula would appear at the next gathering
because of the ‘spectators.’ Similarly, the information he gained was
bound to be helpful for his present life.
However, more gatherings meant it was easier to expose himself!
Indeed, regardless of the world, there is no such thing as a free lunch…
Zhou Mingrui extended his right hand again as he rapped the side of
the long table with his ﬁnger gently.
Considering the fact that he was in control of the gathering’s
summoning and dismissal, any threat of exposure was within the
conﬁnes of his control. The pros clearly exceeded the cons, so Zhou
Mingrui rapidly made a decision.
He stopped his rapping as he smiled at the anticipative and perturbed
gazes of the duo.
“I’m a person who likes a fair and equal exchange.
“Your help will not go unrewarded.
“Every Monday at three in the afternoon, try your best to be alone.
After I make a few more attempts and ﬁgure out certain things,
perhaps you can apply for a leave of absence ahead of time. You will
no longer need to worry about being in inappropriate situations.”
This was a form of agreement to Alger’s and Audrey’s suggestions.
Audrey had just turned seventeen. Having been taken care of her
entire life, she had the character of a young girl. Therefore, she could
not help but clench her ﬁst and gradually pump it in front of her
chest when she heard The Fool’s reply.
Without waiting for Alger to say a word, Audrey said in excitement,
her eyes glowing, “Then, shall we give ourselves call signs? After all,
we can’t use our real names for conversation.”
Although I might not be able to deceive Mr. Fool regarding my true
identity, the person opposite me poses some danger. I must not let him
know who I am!
“Good idea,” answered Zhou Mingrui in a simple and relaxed
manner.
Audrey’s mind immediately began whirring as she aired her thoughts
as they came to her.
“You are Mr. Fool which is derived from tarot cards. Then, as a ﬁxed,
long-term, and secretive ‘Gathering,’ we should be uniform in our
designations. Yes, I’ll also choose one from the tarot cards.”
Her tone slowly turned joyous.
“I’ve decided. My designation shall be ‘Justice!'”
It was one of the twenty-two Major Arcana tarot cards.
“What about you, Mister?” Audrey cheekily smiled at her ‘partner’
sitting across her.
Alger frowned slightly before relaxing it immediately.
“The Hanged Man.”
It was another Major Arcana card.
“Alright, then we can be considered as the founding members of the
Tarot Club!” Audrey was the ﬁrst to blurt it out happily, only to look
fearfully at the fog-concealed Zhou Mingrui. “Will that be alright, Mr.
Fool?”
Zhou Mingrui shook his head in amusement.
“You can decide on such trivial matters by yourselves.”
“Thank you!” Audrey was clearly thrilled.
Following that, she looked at Alger.
“Mr. Hanged Man, can you repeat the address again once more? I’m
afraid that my memories will fail me.”
“No problem.” Alger was very pleased with Audrey’s seriousness as
he repeated the address once more.
After repeating it to herself silently thrice, Audrey said again in
excitement, “I heard that tarot cards were invented by Emperor
Roselle as a game. In fact, doesn’t it come equipped with the power
to divine the future?”
“No. Most of the time, divination stems from one’s self. Everyone has
something spiritual about themselves, allowing them to attune to the
spiritual world and connect to information about themselves at an
even higher level. However, ordinary folks are unable to notice this,
much less be able to interpret the ‘signs’ they receive. This
information will present itself with the help of divination tools. Let
me raise a simple example, dreams and dream interpreters.” Alger
took a glance at Zhou Mingrui and seeing no response from him, he
refuted Audrey’s claim. “Tarot cards are, in fact, such a tool. It uses
more symbolism and more logical elements to help us in conveniently
and accurately interpreting the signs.”
Although Zhou Mingrui appeared indiﬀerent, he was actually
listening very carefully. It was only at this point that his empty mind
slowly became heavy as his head began to feel a throbbing pain.
“Got it.” Audrey nodded in agreement. Following that, she
emphasized, “That’s not what I meant. I’m not doubting the tarot
cards, but I heard that Emperor Roselle had actually created another
set of cards, secret and mysterious ones. They were paper cards
which symbolized a particular unknown power. There was a total of
twenty-two cards that he completed. Later on in life, he referenced
them to create the twenty-two Major Arcana tarot cards which are
used as a gaming tool. Was what I said correct?”
She looked at Zhou Mingrui as though she was attempting to get an
answer from the mysterious Mr. Fool.
All Zhou Mingrui did was smile without saying a word. He cast his
gaze at The Hanged Man as though he was putting him to the test.
Alger subconsciously straightened his back and said in a deep voice,
“That’s right. It is said that Emperor Roselle had seen the Blasphemy
Slate and that set of paper cards contain the profound mysteries of
the twenty-two paths of the divine.”
“Twenty-two paths of the divine…” repeated Audrey with a longing
tone.
At that moment, Zhou Mingrui’s headache intensiﬁed. He felt that his
invisible connection with the crimson stars and grayish-white fog was
beginning to falter.
“Alright, that will be all for today’s gathering,” he said in a deep
voice after making the decision immediately.
“By your will.” Alger bowed his head respectfully.
“By your will.” Audrey mimicked The Hanged Man.
She still had many questions and thoughts; thus, she was unwilling to
have it end so soon.
As Zhou Mingrui severed the connection, he said with a smile, “Let us
look forward to the next gathering.”
The ‘stars’ brightened once more as the crimson light receded like
water. Just as Audrey and Alger heard Mr. Fool’s words, their ﬁgures
turned into a blur as they phased away.
In a second, the ‘projection’ shattered as the gray fog restored its
silence.
As for Zhou Mingrui, he felt himself turning heavy rapidly. His
surroundings turned ﬂeeting as his eyes met darkness before
changing into dazzling sunlight.
He was still standing in the middle of his apartment.
“It was like a dream… What the heck was that foggy world… Who or
what sort of power created the changes that just happened…” Zhou
Mingrui sighed softly. He was completely puzzled as he walked
towards the study desk as though his legs were ﬁlled with lead.
He picked up the pocket watch he placed outside to determine how
much time had passed.
“Time ﬂowed at the same pace.” Zhou Mingrui made a rough
judgment.
After putting down his pocket watch, he found himself unable to
endure the splitting headache any further. He sat on the chair and
lowered his head, using his left thumb and middle ﬁnger to massage
his temples.
After a long while, he suddenly let out a sigh and said in Mandarin,
“From the looks of it, I won’t be able to return any time soon…”
Only the clueless could be fearless. After witnessing such a
fascinating event and learning the situation regarding Beyonders and
the mysterious world, Zhou Mingrui no longer dared to rashly try the
luck enhancement ritual using ancient Feysac or Loen language.
Who knew what other kinds of situation would happen. Perhaps, it
would be more bizarre, horrifying, or even a living hell!
“At the very least, I should attempt only when I have a deep mastery
of mysticism,” thought Zhou Mingrui helplessly.
Thankfully, the so-called Gathering could provide him with help.
After another bout of silence, he muttered to himself with a tone of
dismay, disappointment, agony, and grief, “From this moment forth,
I’m Klein.”
…
Klein tried his best to refocus his solutions and plans so as to purge
the negative emotions in him.
Perhaps, he could learn the potion formula for ‘Spectator’ from the
side…
The ‘Gathering’ that just happened sure is fascinating. People who reside
in diﬀerent places across the world can reduce hundreds of kilometers to
just mere inches and discuss face-to-face while supplying each other’s
needs. Uh, speaking of which, this does sound a little familiar…
Klein was stunned for a few seconds before he burst out in laughter.
Pressing against his temple, he jested under his breath, “Wasn’t that a
social networking platform?”
Chapter 8: A New Era
Whoosh!
Howling wind accompanied a downpour. The three-mast sailboat was
tossed around by the crests and troughs of the incoming waves, as if
it was being toyed by a giant.
The crimson glow in Alger Wilson’s eyes faded. He found himself still
remaining on the deck and nothing appeared to have changed.
Almost immediately, the quirky-shaped glass bottle in his palm
shattered and the frost within melted into the rain. In seconds, there
were no longer any traces left that suggested the existence of the
wondrous antique.
A hexagonal crystal-like snowﬂake emerged on Alger’s palm. It then
faded rapidly until it was seemingly absorbed by the ﬂesh, vanishing
completely in the process. Alger nodded his head in a hardly
noticeable manner, as if he was thinking about something. He
remained still and silent for a full ﬁve minutes.
He turned around and headed for the cabin. As he was about to enter,
a man who wore a similar robe embroidered with lightning patterns
emerged from inside.
This man, who had soft blond hair, paused and looked at Alger. He
held his right ﬁst to his chest and said, “May the Storm be with you.”
Alger replied with the same words and gesture. There were no
emotions on his rough face which had a well-deﬁned structure.
Alger entered the cabin after the greeting and proceeded to the
captain’s cabin situated at the far end of the corridor.
Surprisingly, he did not encounter any sailors on the way. The whole
place was as quiet as a graveyard.
Behind the door to the captain’s cabin, a soft brown carpet overlaid
the ﬂoor. A bookshelf and a wine rack took the opposite side walls of
the room. The books with their yellowish covers and wine bottles
with their dark red color looked peculiar under the ﬂickering
candlelight.
On the desk with the candle, there was a bottle of ink, a quill, a pair
of black metallic telescope, and a sextant made of brass.
Behind the desk sat a pale middle-aged man wearing a captain’s hat
which had a skull on it. As Alger approached him, he said
menacingly, “I will not give in!”
“I believe you can do it,” Alger said calmly, so calm that it felt like he
was commenting on the weather.
“You…” The man seemed to be stunned by the unexpected answer.
At this very moment, Alger leaned forward slightly and suddenly
dashed across the room until they were only separated by the desk.
Pa!
Alger tightened his shoulder and reached out his right hand to choke
the man.
Illusory ﬁsh scales appeared on the back of his hand as he crazily
mustered more strength to choke the man, giving him no time to
respond.
Crack!
Amid the crisp cracking sound, the man’s eyes widened as his body
was lifted up.
His legs twitched furiously before they soon became motionless. His
pupils began to widen as he stared aimlessly. There was a stench
from between his legs as his pants gradually turned moist.
While lifting the man, Alger lowered his back and strode toward the
wall.
Bang! He used the man as a shield and smashed forward at the wall.
His extremely muscular arm was monstrous.
A hole cracked open in the wooden wall, and rain poured in,
accompanied by the scent of the ocean.
Alger ﬂung the man out of the cabin, straight into the giant waves
that resembled mountains.
The wind continued to howl in the dark as almighty nature devoured
everything.
Alger took out a white handkerchief and wiped his right hand
carefully before throwing it into the sea as well.
He stepped back and waited patiently for company.
In less than ten seconds, the blond man from before rushed in and
asked, “What happened?”
“The ‘captain’ has escaped,” Alger answered in an annoyed manner as
he panted. “I didn’t know he still had some of his Beyonder powers.”
“Damn it!” the blond man cursed softly.
He went up to the opening and stared into the distance. However,
nothing was visible except for the waves and the rain.
“Forget it, he was just extra loot,” the blond man said, waving his
arm, “We will still be rewarded for ﬁnding this ghost ship from the
Tudor Era.”
Even if he was a Keeper of the Sea, he would not have hastily dived
into the sea under this weather condition.
“The ‘captain’ will not be able to survive much longer if the storm
continues.” Alger said, as he nodded in approval. The wooden wall
was repairing itself at a discernible rate.
He gazed at the wall and turned his head subconsciously towards the
rudder and the sail.
He was perfectly aware of what was going on behind all the wooden
planks.
The chief mate, the second mate, the crew, and the sailors were not
present. There was no living person on board!
Amidst all the emptiness, the rudder and the sail moved eerily by
themselves.
Alger again pictured “The Fool” who was covered in grayish-white
fog and sighed.
He turned back and looked outside at the mighty waves and spoke as
though in a reverie while ﬁlled with anticipation and awe, “A new
era has begun…”
…
Empress Borough, Backlund, capital of the Loen Kingdom.
Audrey Hall pinched her cheeks in disbelief of her encounter a while
ago.
On the dressing table in front of her, the old bronze mirror had
shattered into pieces.
Audrey cast her gaze downwards and saw the swirling “crimson” on
the back of her hand; it was like a tattoo depicting a star.
The “crimson” gradually faded and disappeared into her skin.
Only at this point in time was Audrey certain that it was not a dream.
Her eyes twinkled as she grinned. She could not help but stand up
before bending down to lift up the hem of her dress.
She curtseyed towards thin air and started dancing lively. It was the
“Ancient Elf Dance, “the most popular dance among royalty at the
moment.
She had a bright smile on her face as she moved about gracefully.
Knock! Knock! Someone suddenly knocked at her bedroom door.
“Who is it?” Audrey immediately stopped her dance and asked as she
tidied her dress to look more elegant.
“My Lady, may I come in? You should start to prepare for the
ceremony,” Audrey’s maidservant asked from outside the door.
Audrey looked into a mirror on the dressing table and quickly wiped
the smile from her face, leaving only a tiny hint of a smile.
She responded gently after she had ensured everything was
presentable, “Come in.”
The doorknob turned and Annie, her maidservant, pushed in.
“Oh, it cracked…” Annie said as she instantly saw the outcome of the
old bronze mirror.
Audrey blinked and said slowly, “Erm, Yes! Susie was here just now. I
am sure you know she likes to wreak havoc!”
Susie was a golden retriever that was not so much of a purebred. It
was a gift given to her father, Count Hall, when he bought a
foxhound. Nevertheless, Audrey adored it.
“You should train it well,” Annie said, as she picked up the pieces of
the bronze mirror adeptly and with care, lest it hurt her mistress.
As she ﬁnished tidying up, she asked Audrey with a smile, “Which
dress do you want to put on?”
Audrey thought for a while and answered,” I like the dress designed
by Mrs. Guinea for my 17th birthday.”
“No, you can’t wear the same dress twice to a formal ceremony or
others will gossip about and question the Hall family’s ﬁnancial
ability,” Annie said, shaking her head in disagreement.
“But I really like it!” Audrey insisted in a gentle manner.
“You can wear it at home or when you attend an event that isn’t so
formal,” Annie said ﬁrmly, suggesting that it was not negotiable.
“Then it will have to be the one with the lotus design along the
sleeves given by Mr. Sades two days ago,” Audrey said as she drew in
a gasp inconspicuously, maintaining her sweet smile.
“You always have such a good taste,” Annie said as she stepped back
and shouted towards the door, “The sixth dressing room! Ah, forget
it, I shall fetch it myself.”
Maidservants began to work. The dress, accessories, footwear, hat,
makeup, and hairstyle—everything had to be taken care of.
When it was almost ready, Count Hall appeared at the door wearing a
dark brown waistcoat.
He had a hat sharing the same color as his clothes and a nice
mustache. His blue eyes were ﬁlled with joy, but his loosening
muscles, widening waist, and wrinkles were obviously destroying his
handsome youth.
“The brightest jewel of Backlund, it is time for our departure,” Count
Hall said, knocking at the door twice.
“Father! Stop calling me that,” Audrey protested as she got up with
the help of the maidservants.
“Well then, it’s time to set oﬀ, my beautiful little princess,” Count
Hall said as he bent his left arm, signaling Audrey to hold his arm.
Audrey shook her head slightly and said, “That is for my mother,
Mrs. Hall, the Countess.”
“Then this side,” Count Hall bent his right arm with a smile and said,
“This is for you, my greatest pride.”
…
The Royal Navy base, Pritz Harbor, Oak Island.
When Audrey took her father’s arm and walked down the carriage,
she was suddenly shocked by the juggernaut in front of her.
In the military port not far away, there was a huge ship shimmering
with metallic reﬂections. It did not have a sail, leaving only an
observatory deck, two towering chimneys, and two turrets at the ends
of the ship.
It was so majestic and large that the ﬂeet of sails nearby were like
newborn dwarfs clustering around a giant.
“Holy Lord of Storms…”
“Oh, m’lord.”
“An ironclad warship!”
…
Amidst the furore, Audrey was also shocked by this unprecedented
miracle created by mankind. It was an ocean miracle that had never
been seen before!
It took a while for the aristocrats, ministers, and members of
parliament to compose themselves. Then, a black spot on the sky
started to grow in size until it occupied a third of the sky and entered
everyone’s view. The atmosphere suddenly became solemn.
It was a gigantic ﬂying machine with a beautiful streamlined design
hovering in mid-air. The deep blue machine had airbags made of
cotton which were supported by alloy structures that were strong but
light. The alloy structure’s bottom had openings mounted with
machine guns, projectile launchers, and muzzles. The exaggerated
humming noise from the ignition steam engine and the tail blades
produced a symphony that left everyone amazed.
The King’s family arrived on their airship, exuding a lofty and
indisputable authority.
Two swords, each with a ruby crown at the handle, were pointing
vertically down and reﬂected the sunlight on both sides of the cabin.
They were the “Sword of Judgment” emblem which symbolized the
Augustus family and has been passed down from the previous epoch.
Audrey was not yet eighteen, so she had not attended the
“introductory ceremony,” which was an event led by the Empress
that marked one’s debut into the Backlund social scene, to announce
her adult status. Therefore, she could not be nearer to the airship and
had to remain silent at the back to watch the entire event.
Nevertheless, it did not matter to her. In fact, she was relieved that
she did not need to deal with the princes.
The ‘miracle’ that mankind used to conquer the sky touched down
gently. The ﬁrst ones to step down the stairs were the handsome
young guards who wore red ceremonial uniforms with white trousers.
Decorated with medals, they formed two lines with riﬂes in hand.
They were awaiting the appearances of King George III, his queen,
and the prince and princess.
Audrey was not new to meeting important people so she showed no
interest at all. Instead, she had her attention on the two statue-like
black-armored cavalry ﬂanking the king.
In this era of iron, steam, and cannons, it was surprising that there
was still someone who could bear wearing full armor.
The cold metallic luster and the dull black helmet conveyed
solemnity and authority.
“Could they be the higher-order Disciplinary Paladins…” Audrey
recalled snippets of a casual conversation among adults. She was
curious but did not dare go close.
The ceremony commenced with the arrival of the king’s family. The
incumbent Prime Minister, Lord Aguesid Negan, went up to the front.
He was a member of the Conservative Party and the second non-
aristocrat to become the Prime Minister till this very day. He was
given the title of a Lord for his great contributions.
Of course, Audrey knew more. The main supporter of the
Conservative Party was the present Duke of Negan, Pallas Negan,
who was the brother of Aguesid!
Aguesid was a slender and almost bald ﬁfty plus year old man with a
sharp gaze. He surveyed the area before speaking.
“Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe you have witnessed this history-
making ironclad warship. It has dimensions of 101 by 21 meters. It
has an amazing port and starboard design. The armor belt is 457
millimeters thick. The displacement is 10060 tonnes. There are four
305-millimeter main cannons, six rapid-ﬁre cannons, 12 six-pound
cannons, 18 six-barrel machine guns, and four torpedo launchers. It
can reach a speed of 16 knots!
“It will be the real hegemon! It will conquer the seas!”
The crowd was roused. The mere descriptions were enough to instill
fearful images in them, let alone the fact that the actual thing was
right in front of them.
Aguesid smiled and spoke a few more lines before saluting the king
and requested, “Your Majesty, please give it a name!”
“Since it will set sail from Pritz Harbor, it should be named “The
Pritz,” George III responded. His expression showed his delight.
“The Pritz!”
“The Pritz!”
…
The words spread from the Navy Minister and the Admiral of the
Royal Navy to all the soldiers and oﬃcers on the deck. They all
exclaimed in unison, “The Pritz!”
George III ordered the Pritz to set sail for a trial in the midst of the
gun salutes and the celebratory atmosphere.
Honk!
Thick smoke spewed out from the chimneys. The sound from the
machinery could be heard faintly beneath the sound of the ship horn.
The juggernaut departed from the harbor. Everyone was shocked
when the two main cannons at the ship’s bow ﬁred at an uninhabited
island in its path.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
The ground shook as dust shot up into the sky. Shock waves spread
out, producing waves in the sea.
Satisﬁed, Aguesid turned back to the crowd and announced, “From
this day on, doomsday will fall on the seven pirates who call
themselves Admirals and the four who call themselves Kings. They
can only shiver in fear!
“It is the end of their era. Only the ironclad warship will roam the
seas no matter whether the pirates have the powers of the Beyonders,
ghost ships, or cursed ships.”
Aguesid’s chief secretary deliberately asked, “Can’t they build their
own ironclad warships?”
Some of the nobles and Members of Parliament nodded, feeling that
such a possibility could not be eliminated.
Aguesid immediately smiled and shook his head slowly as he
answered, “Impossible! It will never be possible! Building our
ironclad warship required three big coal and steel amalgamators, a
scale of more than twenty steel factories, 60 scientists and senior
engineers from the Backlund Cannon Academy and Pritz Nautical
Academy, two royal shipyards, almost hundred factories for spare
parts, an Admiralty, a ship-building committee, a Cabinet, a
determined king with excellent foresight, and a great country with an
annual steel production of 12 million tonnes!
“The pirates will never achieve it.”
Having said that, he paused and raised his arms before shouting in
agitation, “Ladies and Gentlemen, the era of cannons and warships
has dawned upon us!”
Chapter 9: The Notebook
After half an hour of rest, Zhou Mingrui, who now viewed himself as
Klein, ﬁnally recovered. In the meantime, he found that there were
now four black dots on the back of his hand, which happened to form
a small square.
These four black spots faded and disappeared quickly, but Klein knew
that they were still hiding in his body, waiting to be awakened.
“Four spots forming a square; is it in correspondence with the four
pieces of staple food at the four corners of the room? Does this mean
that in the future, I don’t need to prepare the food and can do the
ritual and chants immediately?” Klein made a guess.
This might seem good, but the emergence of the spots was ominous,
and “things” that one lacked understanding of were always scary.
The fact that those inexplicable Chinese Divinations from Earth could
produce eﬀects here, the strange transmigration in his sleep, the
mysterious murmurings that almost drove him crazy during the
ritual, and the mysterious and trippy gray world whose signiﬁcance
he had no idea of made Klein shiver in the hot weather of June.
“The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest
and strongest fear is the fear of the unknown.” He recalled this saying
as he was experiencing the fear of the unknown acutely.
There was in him an unprecedented and irresistible urge to make
contact with the mysterious domain, to learn more, and to explore
the unknown. There was also a contradicting escape mentality within
him compelling him to pretend nothing had happened.
Intense sunlight shone through the window onto the desk. It was as if
there were grains of gold sprinkled on the desk. Klein gazed at the
desk, feeling as though he had come into contact with warmth and
hope.
He relaxed slightly, and a strong sense of fatigue washed over him.
His eyelids were as heavy as lead as they kept closing themselves. It
must have been the combined eﬀect of the sleepless night and the
tiring encounter.
Klein shook his head and pushed himself up with the aid of the desk.
He stumbled towards the double-decked bed, completely disregarding
the rye bread placed at the four corners of the room. He fell asleep
immediately after he lay down.
Groan! Groan!
Klein was woken up by hunger pangs. When he opened his eyes, he
felt rejuvenated.
“There’s still a slight headache.” He rubbed his temples and sat up.
He was so hungry that he could eat a horse!
He returned to the desk while straightening his shirt. He picked up
the silver vine-leaf pocket watch.
Pa!
The pocket watch’s lid sprang open and the second hand was ticking.
“Half past twelve. I slept for three hours…” Klein put the pocket
watch back into his linen shirt pocket in while swallowing.
In the Northern Continent, there were 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes
in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. Whether each second passed
at the same rate here compared to Earth was unknown to Klein.
At this moment, he could not even think of terms such as mysticism,
rituals or the grayish world. His mind was occupied by one thing—
food!
He would leave the thinking to after his meals! Only then could he
work!
Klein picked up the loaves of rye bread from the four corners and
wiped oﬀ the minute specks of dust on it without any hesitation. He
planned on making one of them his lunch.
He decided to dig into the oﬀerings because he only had ﬁve pence
with him and there was a tradition of eating the oﬀerings back in his
hometown. After all, there was not any observable change to the
bread. It was better to be frugal.
Of course, the memory and habits left behind by the original Klein
had also played a role.
It was a huge waste to use the expensive gas only to light up the
room. So, Klein took out a furnace and boiled water with it after
adding some coal. He paced around as he waited.
Anyone would choke eating those loaves of rye bread without water.
Yikes. Life with meat only for dinner is going to be dreadful… No, wait,
this is already an exception. Melissa would only allow our meals to have
meat twice a week if not for my upcoming interview, Klein thought, as he
looked around, hungry. He had nothing better to do.
His eyes seemed to turn avaricious when he set his eyes on the pound
of mutton in the cupboard.
No, I need to wait for Melissa to eat it together , Klein thought as he
shook his head and rejected the idea of cooking half of it right now.
Although he often ate outside, he had still developed some basic
culinary skills, owing to his living in a big city alone. His dishes were
not delicious, but they were at least edible.
Klein turned his body around so that the mutton would not “seduce”
him. Then, he suddenly realized that he had also bought peas and
potatoes in the morning.
Potatoes! Klein immediately had an idea. He quickly turned back to
the cupboard and took out two potatoes from a tiny pile of them.
He ﬁrst cleaned the potatoes in the public bathroom and then added
them into a pot so they were boiled together with the water.
After a while, he sprinkled into the water some yellow coarse salt
from the spices container he found inside the cupboard.
He waited patiently for a few minutes before lifting the pot and
pouring the “soup” into a few cups and a bowl. He took out the
potatoes with a fork and placed them on the desk at the end.
Fﬀﬀﬀf!
He blew at the potato as he peeled it bit by bit. The fragrance of
boiled potato diﬀused through the air. It smelled very appetizing.
He salivated crazily; the heat could not deter him any longer. Klein
took a bite despite having the potato only half peeled.
How fragrant! It had a powdery texture and tasted sweet as he
chewed. He was instantly ﬁlled with emotions and he wolfed down
the two potatoes. He even ate some of the skin.
Then, he held up the bowl and enjoyed the ‘soup.’ The pinch of salt
in water proved to be thirst-quenching.
I really enjoyed eating potatoes this way when I was young… A ﬁlled
Klein exclaimed in his head. Meanwhile, he tore oﬀ a small piece of
bread and dipped it into the ‘soup’ to eat it softened.
Perhaps the ritual was too tiring; Klein ate two loaves of bread which
amounted to a whole pound.
Klein felt he was ﬁnally rejuvenated. He enjoyed the joy of life after
he drank the ‘soup’ before tidying up. Then, he took in the lustrous
sunshine happily.
He sat back at the desk and began planning.
“I can’t escape. I must think of a way to come into contact with
mysticism and become a Beyonder as mentioned by Justice and The
Hanged Man.
“I need to overcome the fear of the unknown.
“The only way now is to wait for the next ‘gathering.’ I need to try
listen for the formula of the ‘Spectator’ potion or other things related
to mysticism.”
“There are four more days before Monday. Before that, I need to ﬁrst
ﬁgure out the problem with Klein. Why did he commit suicide? What
happened to him?”
Unable to transmigrate back and wash his hands of everything, Klein
picked up the notebook that lay on the table. He wanted to ﬁnd hints
that could help him regain his lost memory fragments.
The original Klein obviously had the habit of taking notes. He also
liked to write diaries.
Klein was fully aware that the cabinet that supported the desk on the
right stored a whole stack of completed notebooks.
The book he had began on the 10th of May. Matters regarding his
school, and mentor, as well as content pertaining to knowledge were
at the beginning.
“12th May. Mr. Azik mentioned that the common language used by
the Balam Empire in the Southern Continent also developed from
Ancient Feysac, a branch of Jotun. Why is this so? Does this mean
that every sentient living being once spoke the same language? No,
there has to be a mistake. According to ‘The Revelation of Evernight’
and ‘The Book of Storms’, giants were not the only hegemons of the
world in primordial times. There were also elves, mutants, and
dragons. Anyways, these are just myths and fantasies.”
…
“16th May. Senior Associate Professor Cohen and Mr. Azik discussed
the inevitability of the Age of Steam. Mr. Azik opined that it was just
a coincidence because if it wasn’t for Emperor Roselle, the Northern
Continent would still be wielding swords like the Southern Continent.
Mentor argued that Mr. Azik had placed too much emphasis on the
contribution of an individual. He believes that with progress, even if
there wasn’t an Emperor Roselle, there would be an Emperor Robert.
Therefore, the Age of Steam might come late, but eventually come
nevertheless. I found little meaning in their discussion. I prefer
discovering new things and unraveling the hidden past. Perhaps I am
more suited to study archeology than history.”
…
“29th May. Welch found me and told me that he had acquired a
notebook from the Fourth Epoch. Oh my Goddess! A notebook from
the Fourth Epoch! He didn’t want to ask the archeology department’s
students for help so he came to Naya and me to help him decode the
contents. How can I refuse? Of course, I can only do it after my
graduation defense. I can’t aﬀord diverting my attention at this
stage.”
This caught Klein’s attention. Compared to the notes about history
and viewpoint disagreements, the appearance of a notebook from the
Fourth Epoch might have led to Klein’s suicide.
The Fourth Epoch was the epoch before the present “Iron Age.” Its
history was mysterious and incomplete. Due to the fact that very few
tombs, ancient cities, and records had been found, archaeologists and
historians could only refer to the ambiguous records provided by the
seven major Churches that centered around their religious teachings
to roughly form the ‘original’ picture. They knew the existence of the
Solomon Empire, the Tudor Dynasty, and the Trunsoest Empire.
Having set his sights on solving the mystery and restoring history,
Klein didn’t have much interest in the ﬁrst three eras, whose roots
were closer to legends. He was more interested in the Fourth Epoch,
also known as the Age of the Gods.
“Hmm, so Klein was concerned for his future career and thus focused
on the interview. But it was all futile…” Klein could not resist
exclaiming.
Universities were still very scarce and the majority of students were
either from noble or wealthy families. As long as he did not have an
extreme mindset, a commoner who had been admitted into university
would have been able to build precious social connections through
group discussions and networking events despite the prejudice and
exclusion from the entrenched social circles.
The very generous Welch McGovern was an example. He was the son
of a banker from Constant City, Midseashire, Loen Kingdom. He was
used to asking Naya and Klein for help because they were always in
the same group for work.
Without thinking further, Klein continued reading the notebook.
“18th June. I have graduated. Farewell, Khoy University!”
“19th June. I have seen the notebook. By comparing sentence
structures and root words, I discovered that it is a modiﬁed form of
ancient Feysac. More precisely, over the course of its thousand-year
history, the Feysac language had changed constantly, a little at a
time.”
“20th June. We have deciphered the contents of the ﬁrst page. The
author was a member of a family called Antigonus.”
“21st June. He mentioned the Dark Emperor. This is anachronistic
with regards to the time this notebook is deduced to be written. Is
Professor wrong? Is ‘Dark Emperor’ a common title for every emperor
of the Solomon Empire?”
“22nd June. The Antigonus family apparently had a very high
standing in the Solomon Empire. The author mentions that he was
making a secret transaction with a person named Tudor. Tudor? Is it
related to the Tudor Dynasty?”
“23rd June. I am trying to restrain myself from thinking about the
notebook and going to Welch’s place. I need to prepare for the
interview! It’s very important!”
“24th June. Naya tells me that they have found something new. I
think I need to check it out.”
“25th June. From the new deciphered content, the author had
accepted a mission to visit the ‘Nation of the Evernight’ situated at
the summit of the highest peak of the Hornacis mountain range. Oh
my Goddess! How can a nation exist at the summit of that peak
which is over 6000 meters above sea level? How do they survive?”
“26th June. Are these strange things real?”
The record ended at this point. Zhou Mingrui transmigrated in the
early hours of the 28th.
“Which means to say that there was indeed an entry for June 27th,
it’s that line… Everyone will die, including me…” Klein ﬂipped to the
page he ﬁrst saw when he arrived, feeling goosebumps while he
made the deduction.
In order to solve the mystery of the original Klein’s suicide, he
thought that he should visit Welch and take a look at the ancient
notebook. However, with a lot of experience from novels, movies,
and TV drama series, he suspected that if they were really related,
this visit would be very dangerous—those who went investigating
castles despite knowing that they were haunted served as a warning!
However, he had to go since escaping would never solve the problem.
It would only make things worse, until it welled over and completely
drowned him!
Perhaps call the police? But claiming to have committed suicide would be
silly, right…
Knock!
Knock, knock!
There was a series of quick and forceful knocks.
Klein sat straight up and listened.
Knock!
Knock, knock!
The knocks echoed through the empty hallway.
Chapter 10: The Norm
“Who is it?”
Klein was thinking about the mysterious suicide of the original owner
of this body and the unknown danger he might encounter when he
heard the sudden knock on the door. He subconsciously opened the
drawer, took out the revolver, and asked vigilantly.
The other party was quiet for two seconds before a slightly sharp
voice, in Awwa’s accent, replied, “It’s me, Mountbatten, Bitsch
Mountbatten.”
The voice paused for a moment before adding, “Police.”
Bitsch Mountbatten… When Klein heard this name, he immediately
thought of the owner of this name.
He was the policeman in charge of the street where the apartment
was located. He was a rude, brutal, hands-on man. But perhaps, only
such a man could be a deterrent for alcoholics, thieves, part-time
thieves, villains, and hooligans.
And his unique voice was one of his trademarks.
“Okay, I’ll be right there!” Klein responded loudly.
He had planned to put the revolver back into the drawer but thinking
that he had no idea why the police was outside and that they might
search the room or do other things, he cautiously ran to the stove
where the ﬂames had already been extinguished and put the revolver
in it.
Then he picked up the coal basket, shook a few pieces into the stove,
covered the gun, and ﬁnally placed the kettle over the stove to
conceal everything.
After doing all of that, he tidied up his clothes and quickly
approached the door and murmured, “Sorry, I just had a nap.”
Outside the door stood four policemen in black-and-white checkered
uniforms with peak caps. Bitsch Mountbatten, the one with a brown
beard, coughed and said to Klein, “These three inspectors have
something to ask you.”
Inspectors? Klein looked at the shoulder badges of the other three
reﬂexively and found that two of them had three silver hexagons and
one had two, both of which looked superior to Bitsch Mountbatten,
who had only three chevrons.
As a history student, Klein did little to no research into the ranks of
police epaulets, except that Bitsch Mountbatten often boasted of
being a senior sergeant.
So these three are inspectors? Inﬂuenced by conversations with Benson,
Welch, and his classmates, Klein had the common sense to make way
and point into the room.
“Please come in. How might I help you?”
The leader of the three inspectors was a middle-aged man with sharp
eyes. He seemed to be able to read the mind of a person and make
them fearful. His eyes were wrinkled, and the edge of his hat
revealed light brown hair. He looked around the room and asked in a
deep voice, “Do you know Welch McGovern?”
“What’s wrong with him?” Klein quivered and blurted back.
“I’m the one asking the questions.” The digniﬁed middle-aged police
inspector had a stern look in his eyes.
The inspector next to him, also wearing three silver hexagons, looked
at Klein and smiled gently.
“Don’t be nervous. It’s just a routine questioning.”
This policeman was in his thirties, with a straight nose and gray eyes
that, like a lake in an ancient forest that no one visited, gave him an
indescribable sense of depth.
Klein took a breath and organized his words.
“If you mean Welch McGovern, the graduate of Khoy University from
Constant, then I’m sure I know him. We are classmates with the same
mentor, Senior Associate Professor Quentin Cohen.”
In the Loen Kingdom, “Professor” was not only a professional title,
but also a position, just like the combination of professors and
department deans on Earth. That meant there could only be one
professor in a university’s department. If an associate professor
wanted to become professor, they had to wait for their superior to
retire, or force out their superior with their abilities.
As talents needed to be retained, the kingdom’s Higher Education
Commission had added senior associate professors in the three-level
system of lecturers, associate professors and professors after years of
observation. This title was given to anyone with high academic
achievements or with enough seniority but did not make it to the
position of professor.
At this point, Klein looked into the eyes of the middle-aged police
inspector and thought for a second.
“To be honest, our relationship is quite good. During this period, I
met with him and Naya frequently to interpret and discuss the Fourth
Epoch notebook that belonged to him. Inspectors, did something
happen to him?”
Instead of answering, the middle-aged police inspector looked
sideways at his gray-eyed colleague.
The inspector with the peak cap and ordinary looks replied mildly,
“I’m sorry, Mr. Welch has passed away.”
“WHAT?” Despite having some hunches, Klein could not help but
shout out in astonishment.
Welch died just like the original owner of this body?
That is a little scary!
“What about Naya?” Klein questioned hurriedly.
“Ms. Naya passed away too,” the gray-eyed police inspector said
quite calmly. “Both of them died in Mr. Welch’s house.”
“Killed?” Klein had a vague guess.
Perhaps it was suicide…
The gray-eyed inspector shook his head.
“No, the scene suggests that they committed suicide. Mr. Welch hit
the wall with his head many times, covering the wall with blood. Ms.
Naya drowned herself in a basin. Yes, the kind used to wash your
face.”
“That’s impossible…” Klein’s hairs stood on their ends as he seemed
capable of imagining the strange scene.
A girl kneeling on a chair and burying her face into a basin ﬁlled with
water. Her soft brown hair swaying in the wind, but her entire person
remaining motionless. Welch falling to the ground and staring at the
ceiling intently. His forehead in a complete blood-mangled mess, while the
traces of the impact on the wall were evident the with dripping of blood…
The gray-eyed inspector continued, “We believe so too, but the
autopsy results and the situation at the scene exclude factors such as
drugs and external forces. They—being Mr. Welch and Ms. Naya—
showed no signs of struggling.”
Before Klein could speak again, he stepped into the room and asked,
pretending to be casual, “When was the last time you saw Mr. Welch
or Ms. Naya?”
As he spoke, he gestured with his eyes to his colleague with two
silver hexagons.
He was a young police inspector and looked about the same age as
Klein. With black sideburns and green pupils, he was good looking
and had a poet’s romantic temperament.
When he heard the question, Klein thought about it and answered it
thoughtfully, “It should be June 26th, we were reading a new chapter
in the notes. Then, I went home to prepare for my interview on June
30th. Uh, the interview was for the History Department of Tingen
University.”
Tingen was known as the city of universities. There were two
universities, Tingen and Khoy, as well as technical schools, law
colleges and business colleges. It was second only to Backlund, the
capital.
As soon as he ﬁnished, he saw the young police inspector walk
towards his desk in the corner of his eye and pick up the notes which
resembled more of a diary.
Damn! I forgot to hide it!
“Hey!” Klein cried out.
The young inspector smiled back at him, but did not stop ﬂipping
through his notes, while the gray-eyed inspector explained, “This is a
necessary procedure.”
At this time, Bitsch Mountbatten and the digniﬁed middle-aged police
inspectors were just watching without interrupting or assisting in the
search.
Where are your search warrants? Klein had intended to question them,
but on second thought, the judicial system of the Loen Kingdom did
not seem to have such a thing as search warrants. At least he did not
know if there was one. After all, the police force had only been
established for ﬁfteen or sixteen years.
When the original owner of this body was still a child, they were still
called Public Security Oﬃcers.
Klein couldn’t stop it. He watched the young inspector ﬂip through
his notes, but the gray-eyed inspector did not ask any questions.
“What is this strange thing?” The young police inspector turned to
the end of the notes and suddenly asked, “And what does this mean?
‘Everyone will die, including me’…”
Isn’t it common sense that everyone dies except for deities? Klein was
prepared to quibble, but it suddenly occurred to him that he had
planned to “connect” with the police in case of possible danger, but
he had no reasons or excuses.
He made a decision in less than a second. Putting his hand over his
forehead, he answered painfully, “I have no idea. I really have no
idea… When I woke up this morning, I felt I wasn’t quite right, as if I
had forgotten something. It’s especially true for whatever happened
recently. I don’t even know why I had written such a sentence.”
Sometimes, being frank was the best way to solve a problem. Of
course, it required skills. There were things that could be said and
could not be said, and the order of what was said ﬁrst mattered.
As an expert keyboard warrior, Klein was also good at sophistry.
“That is ridiculous! Do you think we are fools?” Bitsch Mountbatten
could not help but interject angrily.
This is such a bad lie that it insults the intelligence of his and his
colleagues!
It’s better for you to pretend to be mentally ill than to pretend to be an
amnesiac!
“I’m speaking the truth,” Klein responded frankly, looking into the
eyes of Mountbatten and middle-aged police inspectors.
It really could not be more true.
“Maybe it is,” the gray-eyed police inspector said slowly.
What? He really believed it? Klein was surprised himself.
The gray-eyed inspector smiled at him and said, “An expert will come
in two days and believe me, she should be able to help you to recall
your lost memories.”
Expert? Help me remember my memories? In the ﬁeld of psychology?
Klein frowned.
Hey, what if his memories of Earth were exposed? He suddenly felt like
facepalming himself.
The young police inspector put down his notes and searched his desk
and room. Fortunately, he focused on books instead of lifting the
kettle.
“Well, Mr. Klein, thank you for your cooperation. We advise that
you’d better not leave Tingen for the coming days. If you have to,
please notify Inspector Mountbatten, or you’ll become a fugitive,” the
gray-eyed police inspector warned.
That’s it? That’s it for today? No other questions with deeper
investigations? Or taking me back to the police station to torture me for
information? Klein was at a loss.
Nevertheless, he wanted to solve the odd turn of events brought
about by Welch too. So he nodded.
“That wouldn’t be an issue.”
The inspectors exited the room one by one, and the young man at the
end suddenly patted Klein on the shoulder.
“It’s really nice. Very lucky.”
“What?” Klein’s face was puzzled.
The green-eyed police inspector with a poet’s temperament smiled
and said, “Generally speaking, the norm is for all the involved parties
to die in such an event. We are very glad and fortunate to see you
still alive.”
After that, he exited the room and closed the door behind him in
well-mannered manner.
The norm is for everyone to die together? Very glad that I’m still alive?
Fortunate that I’m still alive?
On this June afternoon, Klein was chilling all over.
Chapter 11: Real Culinary Skills
The norm is for everyone to die together? Very glad that I’m still alive?
Fortunate that I’m still alive?
Klein shivered and quickly ran to the door, trying to catch up with
the policemen and ask for protection.
But as soon as he reached the handle, he suddenly stopped.
That oﬃcer talked so horribly about it, why didn’t they protect me, an
important witness or key lead?
Isn’t that too careless?
Were they just probing me? Or maybe it’s a bait?
All kinds of thoughts rushed into Klein’s mind; he suspected that the
police were still secretly “watching” him, observing his reaction.
He felt much calmer after thinking of this and was no longer so
panicked. He slowly opened the door, deliberately shouting with a
trembling voice at the staircase, “You guys will protect me, right?”
Tap, tap, tap… There was no response from the police oﬃcers, and
there was no change in the rhythm of the contact between the leather
shoes and the wooden stairs.
“I know! You’ll do that!” Klein shouted again in a tone of feigned
conviction, trying to act like a normal person that was in danger.
The sound of footsteps gradually weakened and disappeared into the
bottom ﬂoor of the apartment.
Klein snorted and laughed, “Isn’t that response too fake? Their acting
skills are not up to standard!”
He did not run after them. Instead, he turned back to the room and
closed the door behind him.
In the next few hours, Klein fully expressed what they called back in
Foodaholic Empire, China—restlessness, nervousness, agitation,
inadvertence and murmuring words that he did not understand. He
did not slack just because there was no one around.
This is called the self-cultivation of an actor! He laughed at himself in
his heart.
When the sun moved to the west, the clouds on the horizon appeared
to be reddish-orange. Tenants in the apartment came home one after
another; Klein shifted his focus elsewhere.
“Melissa is almost done with school…” He looked at the stove, lifted
the kettle, peeled oﬀ the coal and took out the revolver.
Without pause or delay, he reached to the back of the board under
the double-decked bed where more than ten wooden strips were
staggered out.
After clipping the left wheel between a piece of wooden strip and
board, Klein straightened up and waited uneasily, fearing that the
police would burst open the door and rush into the room with guns
in their hands.
If it was an Age of Steam, he was certain he would not be seen by
anyone when he did that. However, there were extraordinary powers
here, ones that he had proven through his own experiences.
After waiting for a few minutes, there was no movement at the door.
There was only the chatter between two tenants who were heading
for the Heart of the Wild Bar on Iron Cross Street.
“Phew.” Klein exhaled, feeling assured.
All he needed to do was wait for Melissa’s return and cook the stewed
mutton with tender peas!
When the idea came to Klein’s mind, his mouth seemed to taste the
rich ﬂavor of the gravy; he remembered how Melissa cooked stewed
mutton with tender peas.
First, she boiled the water and stir-fried the meat. Then, she added
onions, salt, a little pepper, and water. After a speciﬁc period of time,
the peas and potatoes were added, and the stew was to be cooked for
an additional forty or ﬁfty minutes with the lid on.
“It’s indeed a simple and crude way to do it… Supported purely by
the ﬂavors of the meat itself!” Klein shook his head.
But there was no other way about it. It was hard for commoners to
have many kinds of condiments and various cooking methods. They
could only pursue simple, practical, and economical methods. As long
as the meat was not burnt or spoiled, anything was good for people
who could only eat meat once or twice a week.
Klein was not a very good cook himself and ordered takeout food
most of the time. But by cooking three or four times a week, after
many weeks of accumulated practice, he had a passing standard and
felt that he would not let the pound of mutton down.
“When Melissa comes back to cook it, it will be done after 7:30pm.
She would be starving by then… It’s time for her to see what real
cooking is!” Klein made an excuse for himself. First, he started the
ﬁre again, went to the bathroom to collect water, and washed the
mutton. Then he took out the kitchen boards and knives before
chopping the mutton into tiny chunks.
As for the explanation for his sudden culinary skills, he decided to
blame it on the dead Welch McGovern, who had not only hired a chef
who was good at the Midseashire ﬂavor, but also often created his
own delicacies and invited people to try them.
Well, the dead cannot refute me!
Nevertheless, tsk, this is a world with Beyonders; the dead are not
necessarily unable to speak. With that in mind, Klein was a little guilty
conscience.
He threw aside his confused thoughts and put the meat into the soup
bowl. Then he took out the condiment box and added in a spoonful of
the crude salt, half of which had begun yellowing. In addition, he
cautiously took some black pepper grains from a special small bottle,
mixing and marinating them together.
He placed the saucepan on the stove and, while waiting for it to heat
up, Klein rummaged for the carrots from yesterday and cut them into
pieces with the onions he bought today.
When he was done with his preparations, he took out a small can
from the cupboard and opened it. There was not much lard left in it.
Klein took a spoonful, put it in the pan, and melted it. He added in
the carrots and onions and stirred it for a while.
As the fragrance began to pervade, Klein poured all the mutton into
the pot and fried it with care for a while.
He should have added cooking wine in the process, or red wine at
least. However, the Moretti family did not have these luxuries and
could only drink a glass of beer a week. Klein had to make do with
whatever was available and poured in some boiled water.
After stewing for about twenty minutes, he opened the lid, put the
tender peas and cut potatoes in it, and added a cup of hot water and
two spoons of salt.
He closed the lid, lowered the ﬁre, and exhaled satisfactorily, waiting
for his sister to reach home.
As seconds turned into minutes, the fragrance in the room intensiﬁed.
There was the allure from the meat, the rich smell of potatoes, and
the refreshing scent of onions.
The smell gradually mixed up, and Klein swallowed his saliva from
time to time, keeping track of the time with his pocket watch.
After more than forty minutes, some not-so-brisk but rhythmic
footsteps approached. A key was inserted, the handle was turned, and
the door opened.
Before Melissa came in, she whispered doubtfully, “Smells good…”
With her bag still in her hand, she stepped in and glanced over at the
stove.
“You made this?” Melissa took oﬀ her veil hat and her hand paused
mid-air, looking at Klein in astonishment.
She twitched her nose and inhaled more of the fragrance. Her eyes
quickly softened, and she seemed to ﬁnd some conﬁdence.
“You made this?” she asked again.
“Are you afraid I’d waste the mutton?” Klein smiled and returned
with a question. Without waiting for an answer, he said to himself,
“Don’t worry, I speciﬁcally asked Welch to teach me how to cook this
dish. You know, he has a good cook.”
“First time?” Melissa’s eyebrows creased subconsciously, but they
were smoothed by the fragrance.
“It looks like I’m talented.” Klein laughed. “It’s almost done. Put your
books and veil hat down somewhere. Go to the bathroom and wash
your hands, and then get ready to taste it. I’m very conﬁdent about
it.”
When she heard her brother’s orderly arrangements and saw his
gentle and calm smile, Melissa stood rooted at the door and failed to
respond in her daze.
“Do you prefer the mutton to be cooked longer?” Klein urged with a
laugh.
“Ah, okay, okay!” Melissa jolted back to her senses. With handbag
and veil in each hand, she rushed into the room quickly.
When the lid of the saucepan was uncovered, a sudden blast of steam
appeared before Klein’s eyes. Two pieces of rye bread were already
placed to the side of the mutton and tender peas, allowing them to
absorb the fragrance and heat to become soft.
By the time Melissa had packed her items, washed her hands and
face, and returned, a plate of stewed mutton with tender peas,
potatoes, carrots and onions was already placed on the table. Two
pieces of rye bread, colored by a light dip into the gravy, were on
their plates.
“Come on, try it.” Klein pointed to the wooden fork and spoon next
to the plate.
Melissa was still a little confused. She didn’t refuse; she picked up a
potato with her fork, put it into her mouth and bit it lightly.
The taste of the starchy potato and gravy fragrance ﬂooded her
mouth. Her saliva secretion went crazy as she gobbled down the
potato in a few mouthfuls.
“Try the mutton.” Klein gestured at the plate with his chin.
He had tasted it just now and thought it was barely at a passing
standard, but it was enough for a girl who was inexperienced with
what the world had to oﬀer. After all, she only ate meat occasionally.
Melissa’s eyes were ﬁlled with anticipation as she carefully forked
some mutton.
It was very tender and, as soon as it entered the mouth, nearly
melted. The fragrance of the meat exploded in her mouth, ﬁlling it
with delicious meat juices.
It was an unprecedented feeling and that made Melissa unable to stop
eating.
By the time she realized it, she had already eaten several pieces of
the mutton.
“I… I… Klein, this was supposed to be prepared for you…” Melissa
blushed and stammered.
“I’d nibbled some of the food just now. It’s the privilege of being a
cook.” Klein smiled and soothed her sister. He picked up his fork and
spoon. At times, he would eat a piece of meat and sometimes, he
would stuﬀ his mouth full of peas. At other times, he would put down
the utensils, break oﬀ a piece of rye bread and dip it in gravy.
Melissa relaxed and was immersed in the delicacy again by Klein’s
normal behavior.
“It’s really delicious. It doesn’t seem like you were doing it for the
ﬁrst time.” Melissa looked at the empty dish and praised him with all
her heart. Even the gravy was ﬁnished.
“It’s a long way from Welch’s chef. When I’m rich, I’ll take you and
Benson out to the restaurant and have a better meal!” Klein said. He
was beginning to look forward to it himself.
“Your interview… Burp…” Melissa did not ﬁnish her words because
she suddenly let out a sound of contentment involuntarily.
She put her hand over her mouth in a hurry and looked embarrassed.
The fault is with the stewed mutton with tender peas just now! It was just
too delicious.
Klein laughed secretly and decided not to make fun of his sister. He
pointed to the plate and said, “This is your mission.”
“All right!” Melissa stood up immediately, took the basin and rushed
out the door.
When she came back, she opened the cupboard to check the
condiment box and other items as per normal.
“Did you just use them?” Melissa was surprised, and turned to Klein,
holding the black pepper bottle and lard can.
Klein shrugged his shoulders and laughed.
“Just a little. It’s the price of a delicacy.”
Melissa’s eyes twinkled, her expression changing for a few moments,
before she ﬁnally said, “Let me cook in the future.”
“Um… You have to hurry up and prepare for the interview. You have
to think about your job.”
Chapter 12: Here Again
Melissa, can you not rub my nose in it… Klein muttered inwardly. He
felt a throbbing pain in his head.
The amount of content Klein had forgotten was considered a lot, but
neither was it negligible. The interview was in two days, so how
could he ﬁnd the time to make up for it…?
Furthermore, he was involved in such strange paranormal activity, so
how would it be possible that he would be in the mood to revise?
Klein gave his sister a perfunctory response and began putting on the
appearance of studying. Melissa moved a chair over to sit beside him.
With light shining from the gas lamp, she began working on her
assignments.
The atmosphere was serene. When it was almost eleven o’clock, the
siblings bade each other goodnight and went to bed.
…
Knock!
Knock! Knock!
Poundings on the door roused Klein from his dreams.
He peered out of the window to see the ﬁrst glimmer of dawn. In a
daze, he ﬂipped over and sat up.
“Who is it?”
Look at the time now! Why didn’t Melissa wake me up?
“It’s me. Dunn Smith,” a man with a deep voice outside the door
replied.
Dunn Smith? Don’t know him… Klein got oﬀ his bed and shook his
head as he walked towards the door.
He opened the door to see the gray-eyed police inspector whom he
had met the day before standing in front of him.
Alarmed, Klein asked, “Is there something wrong?”
The policeman replied with a stern look, “We found a carriage driver.
He testiﬁed that you had gone to Mr. Welch’s place on the 27th—the
day when Mr. Welch and Ms. Naya died. Furthermore, Mr. Welch was
the one who paid for your transportation fees.”
Klein was startled. He did not feel a tinge of fear or guilt that one
would expect from having his lies exposed.
It was because he was not even lying. In fact, he was surprised by the
evidence provided by Dunn Smith.
On the 27th of June, the former Klein had indeed gone to Mr.
Welch’s place. On the night that he returned, he killed himself, the
exact same way as Welch and Naya did!
Klein gave a forced smile and said, “This is insuﬃcient evidence. It
does not directly prove that I am associated with the death of Welch
and Naya. Honestly speaking, I’m also very curious about the whole
incident. I want to know what exactly happened to my two poor
friends. But… But… I really can’t remember. In fact I have almost
completely forgotten what I had done on the 27th. You may ﬁnd it
hard to believe, but I fully relied on the diaries I had written to
roughly make a guess that I had gone to Welch’s place on the 27th.”
“You sure have great mental fortitude,” Dunn Smith said while
nodding. He showed not a trace of anger; nor was he smiling.
“You should be able to hear my sincerity,” Klein looked him straight
in the eye and said.
I’m telling the truth! Of course, only part of it!
Dunn Smith did not give an immediate response. He swept his glance
across the room before saying slowly, “Mr. Welch lost a revolver. I
guess… I should be able to ﬁnd it here. Right? Mr. Klein?”
Indeed… Klein ﬁnally understood where the revolver had come from.
A thought ﬂashed in his mind and he came to the ﬁnal verdict in an
instant.
He raised his hands halfway and retreated, leaving a path open.
Then, he signaled at the bunk bed with his chin.
“Behind the bed board.”
He did not speciﬁcally mention that it was the bottom deck, as no
one would normally hide things at the back of the bed board on an
upper deck. That would be too obvious for guests to notice at a
glance.
Dunn Smith did not move forward. The corners of his mouth
twitched as he asked, “Nothing to add on?”
Without hesitation, Klein replied, “There is!”
“Yesterday, when I woke up in the middle of the night, I realized I
was laying on my desk with a revolver beside me. There was a bullet
at the corner of the room. It was as if I had committed suicide. But
due to a lack of experience of never having used a gun, or maybe I
was too scared at the ﬁnal moment… Anyway, the bullet did not
achieve the desired result, my head is still in its place. I am still alive
now.
“And since then, I have lost some memories, including what I saw
and did at Welch’s place on the 27th. I’m not lying. I really can’t
remember.”
For the sake of being eliminated as a suspect. For the sake of getting
rid of all these strange events surrounding him, Klein explained
almost everything that had happened. Except, the transmigration and
“gathering.”
Also, Klein was careful with his words, allowing every sentence to be
amenable. Such as, not revealing the fact that the bullet had hit his
brains, but only mentioning that it did not achieve the desired result,
and that his head was still in its place.
To others, these two statements might seem to convey the exact same
ideas, but in reality they were like chalk and cheese.
Dunn Smith listened quietly, then said, “This corresponds with what I
had surmised. It also corresponds with the hidden logic of similar
incidents in the past. Of course, I have no idea how you managed to
survive.”
“I’m glad you believe in me. I don’t know how I survived either.”
Klein heaved a small sigh of relief.
“But—” Dunn threw out a conjunction. “There is no use in me
believing you. You are currently the prime suspect. You have to be
conﬁrmed by an ‘expert’ that you have indeed forgotten what you
went through, or that you indeed have nothing to do with the deaths
of Mr. Welch and Miss Naya.”
He coughed, his expression becoming serious.
“Mr. Klein, I seek your cooperation on coming with me to the police
station for the investigation. This should take roughly two to three
days if it is conﬁrmed that there are no issues with you.”
“The expert is here?” Klein asked blankly in return.
Didn’t they say it would take another two days?
“She came earlier than expected.” Dunn turned sideways, signaling
for Klein to leave.
“Allow me to leave a note,” Klein requested.
Benson was still away and Melissa had gone to school. He could only
leave a note to inform them that he was involved in an incident
associated with Welch so that they would not worry about him.
Dunn nodded, barely minding.
“Alright.”
Klein returned to the desk. As he searched for paper, he began
thinking about what was about to occur.
Honestly speaking, he did not wish to meet the ‘expert.’ After all, he
had a bigger secret.
In a place where there were seven major churches, under the premise
that Emperor Roselle, who was suspected to be a transmigrator
predecessor, was assassinated, a thing like ‘transmigration’ usually
meant having to go to court and enter arbitration!
But, without weapons, combat skills, or superpowers, he was no
match for a professional policeman. What’s more, a few of Dunn’s
subordinates were standing in the dark outside.
Once they draw their guns and shoot at me, I’d be ﬁnished!
“Ugh, I’ll take one step at a time.” Klein left the note, grabbed his
keys, and followed Dunn out the room.
Along the dark aisle, four policemen in black-and-white checkered
uniforms split into pairs and guarded them on both sides. They were
very alert.
Tap. Tap. Tap. Klein followed alongside Dunn as they went down the
wooden stairs which occasionally creaked in protest.
Outside the apartment, there was a four-wheeled carriage. On the
side of the carriage, there was the “two crossed swords and a crown”
police emblem. Their surroundings were crowded and bustling with
noise as usual.
“Go on, up.” Dunn signaled for Klein to go ﬁrst.
Klein was just about to step forward when an oyster seller suddenly
grabbed a customer and claimed that he was a thief.
Both parties wrestled and triggered a response from the horses,
causing great chaos.
An opportunity!
There wasn’t much time for Klein to think any further; he bent
forward and dashed towards the crowd.
Either shoving or dodging, he escaped frantically towards the other
end of the street.
Right now, for the sake of not “meeting” the expert, he could only
proceed by going to the pier outside the city, taking a boat down the
Tussock River and escaping to the capital, Backlund. The population
was higher there, making it easier to hide.
Of course, he could also get on a steam train, go eastward to the
nearest Enmatt Harbor and take the sea route to Pritz, then towards
Backlund.
Not long after, Klein arrived at a street and made a turn onto Iron
Cross Street. There were several carriages that could be hired.
“To the pier outside the city.” Klein reached out his hand and hopped
onto one of the carriages.
He had thought through things clearly. Firstly, he had to mislead the
police that were coming for him. Once the carriage was a suitable
distance away from them, he would jump right oﬀ!
“Alrighty.” The carriage driver tugged at the reins.
Clop! Clop! Clop… The carriage left Iron Cross Street.
Just as Klein was about to jump oﬀ the carriage, he noticed that it
had turned into another road. It wasn’t leading out of the city!
“Where are you going?” Klein blurted in his momentary daze.
“To Welch’s place…” the carriage driver answered monotonously.
What!? Klein was at a loss for words. The carriage driver turned
around, exposing his cold gray eyes. It was Dunn Smith, the gray-
eyed policeman!
“You!” Klein was ﬂustered. Everything suddenly became a blur as
though the world spun around him when he instantly sat up.
Sat up? Klein looked around, confused. He noticed the crimson moon
outside the window and the room being covered in a crimson veil.
He reached out with his hand to feel his forehead. It was all moist
and cold. Cold sweat. His back felt exactly the same.
“It was a nightmare…” Klein heaved a sigh. “All is well… All is
well…”
He found it weird. He was rather clear-minded in his dream, he was
even able to think calmly!
After calming down, Klein looked at his pocket watch. It was only
two in the morning. He got out of bed quietly and planned to head to
the washroom where he could wash his face and empty his
burgeoning bladder.
He opened the door and walked along the dark corridor. Under the
dim moonlight, he walked lightly towards the washroom.
Suddenly, he noticed a silhouette outside the window at the end of
the corridor.
That silhouette was wearing a black windbreaker that was shorter
than a coat, but longer than a jacket.
That silhouette was partly camouﬂaged in the darkness, bathing in
the crimson moonlight.
That silhouette turned around slowly. His eyes deep, gray, and cold.
Dunn Smith!
Chapter 13: Nighthawk
Plop!
Klein could not help but take a step back. For a moment he was
unsure if he was awake or still in his dreams.
The silhouette took oﬀ his black top hat and bowed a little as he said
with a smile, “Reintroducing myself, Nighthawk, Dunn Smith.”
Nighthawk? One of the codenames of the Church of the Evernight
Goddess’ Beyonder teams which ‘Justice’ and ‘The Hanged Man’
mentioned before? Klein suddenly realised something, and exclaimed
after making a connection, “You can control dreams? You just made
me dream of that?”
Nighthawk Dunn Smith wore his black hat again, concealing his
slightly high hairline. With deep gray eyes he said, “No, I only
entered your dream and made the necessary guidance.”
His voice was deep and soothing; it reverberated through the dimly
lit corridor without disturbing the sweet dreams of others, “In
dreams, even though much of your usually suppressed emotions and
various dark thoughts in you are ampliﬁed—making everything seem
chaotic, absurd, and crazy—they are all rooted in reality since reality
exists. For veterans like me, everything is crystal clear. Compared to
a conscious you, I believe the you in your dreams more.”
This… What normal human being could control his dream? If I had
dreamed of something on Earth, wouldn’t Dunn Smith have noticed? Klein
was petriﬁed by what had happened in the dream.
Yet he quickly found it bizarre. He remembered being very much
sober and rational—knowing what to say and what not to say.
To put it simply, it did not feel like dreaming at all!
So, Dunn Smith only “saw” what I wanted him to see?
Klein’s mind whirled as he gained a glimmer of understanding.
This is a perk that resulted from transmigration? Like having a special
body and soul? Or was it the eﬀects of that luck enhancement ritual?
“So, Mr Smith, do you believe that I really lost my memory?” Klein
organized his thoughts and asked in reply.
Dunn Smith did not answer him directly. Instead he looked at him
keenly.
“You are actually not surprised by the course of events?”
“I’ve met people who wouldn’t believe in the power of the Beyonders,
and they would rather believe that they haven’t really woken up.”
Klein tersely acknowledged as he said, “Perhaps, I have always been
praying, hoping that there was such power to help me.”
“An interesting train of thought… Perhaps you survived not only
because you were lucky.” Dunn nodded expressionlessly. “I can now
conﬁrm that you really lost parts of your memories due to the
incident, especially those related to it.”
“So can I go back now?” Klein heaved a long sigh of relief in his heart
as he probed.
Dunn placed a hand in his pocket and walked slowly towards Klein,
the surrounding darkness becoming tranquil and gentle.
“No, you still have to come with me to see the expert,” he smiled
politely and said.
“Why?” Klein blurted out, then added, “You don’t believe in the
ﬁndings from my dream?”
You must be joking, if that “expert” specializes in hypnosis or mind-
reading and stuﬀ, then wouldn’t my biggest secret be exposed?
The consequences would be beyond imagination!
“I’m quite humble usually, but I’m still conﬁdent for things related to
dreams.” Dunn calmly replied, “However, for important key matters,
there is no harm in conﬁrming them again. Plus, our specialties lie in
diﬀerent areas. Perhaps, she can help you recover some of your
memories.”
Not waiting for Klein to reply, his voice turned deeper. “After all
you’re connected to the whereabouts of that Antigonus family
notebook.”
“What?” Klein froze.
Dunn stopped in front of him, locking his gray eyes on Klein’s eyes
and said, “At the scene of the suicide, there was not a single trace of
that notebook from the Fourth Epoch. Welch is dead, Naya is dead;
you are our only lead.”
“…Alright then.” Klein went silent for a moment before exhaling.
A missing notebook… now this is really peculiar!
How did I not think about the whereabouts of that notebook from the
Fourth Epoch!
Dunn nodded slightly, walking pass Klein and said, “Lock your door
and come with me to Welch’s apartment, the expert is waiting for us
there.”
Klein took in a silent breath. His heart was thumping wildly as he felt
uneasy.
He wanted to decline and even had the intention to run. However, he
believed that with what had happened in his dreams, Dunn Smith
would have deﬁnitely heightened his level of guard. And with the
diﬀerence in strength between a normal human and a Beyonder,
there was little chance of success by using force.
He must have a revolver with him too… He must also have had practice
using the revolver…
Many thoughts ﬂashed past his mind, and eventually Klein chose to
accept the reality.
“Alright.”
Sigh, I can only take one step at a time and see how things unfold; maybe,
that miraculous power in my dream will take eﬀect again…
“Then let’s go,” Dunn said in an indiﬀerent tone.
Klein turned and followed. After taking two steps, he suddenly
stopped and said, “Mr. Smith, I… I would like to use the bathroom
ﬁrst.”
I came out originally for the bathroom…
Dunn did not stop him. Instead, he gave him a keen look and said,
“No problem, Klein. Believe me, I am far more powerful than you can
imagine in the dark night.”
In the dark night… Klein silently repeated this phrase.
He did not make any reckless attempt to escape and honestly relieved
himself. He then washed his face with cold water, completely
calming himself down.
Klein changed his outﬁt and closed the door to his apartment. With
gentle steps, Klein followed Dunn down the stairs and walked
towards the building’s entrance.
In such a tranquil setting, Dunn Smith opened his mouth and spoke
suddenly, “At the end of the dream, why did you try to escape? What
were you afraid of?”
Klein immediately thought of an answer as he said, “I do not
remember what I did at Welch’s place, nor do I remember if I was
directly involved in Welch’s and Naya’s deaths. I was afraid that if it
was really proven to be my doing, I would rather gamble and escape.
I can then start anew in the Southern Continent.”
“I would’ve done the same if I were you,” Dunn said as he pushed
opened the door to the building, letting in the cool midnight breeze
to disperse the sweltering heat inside.
He was not afraid of Klein running away as he got on the carriage. It
was exactly the one Klein had dreamed of—a four-wheeled carriage
drawn by a single horse and the carriage driver. There was also the
police emblem of double-crossed swords that clustered a crown
carved onto the side of the carriage.
Klein followed into the carriage. Inside, there was a thick carpet laid
out and the place was ﬁlled with a soothing fragrance.
Having sat down, he looked for a topic to probe for more
information.
“Mr. Smith, what if—and I mean if—the ‘expert’ conﬁrms that I have
really forgotten a part of my memories? And that there is no other
evidence which points to me being the perpetrator or a victim, would
this be over?”
“In theory, yes. We will try to search for the notebook through other
means. As long as it exists, it can be found. Of course, before that, we
will have to make sure you are not cursed or have any scent of
cacodemons and that there are no related psychological problems
lingering. We must ensure that you can embrace the rest of your life
peacefully and healthily.” Dunn Smith had a smile on his face, a
rather unusual smile.
Klein caught on to this point keenly, and promptly inquired, “In
theory?”
“Yes, only in theory. In this ﬁeld of work, there are always twisted,
unorthodox, and inexplicable things happening.” Dunn looked Klein
in the eye and said, “Their continuation or end are not what we can
foresee or control at times.”
“For example?” Klein actually felt frightened for a moment.
The carriage sped through an almost empty street. Dunn took out his
tobacco pipe and sniﬀed it, saying, “When we believe that things
have come to an end, with everything going back to normal, it would
resurface in a terrifying, chilling way.”
“A few years ago, we handled a case regarding an evil cult. They did
live sacriﬁces to please an evil god by making followers commit
suicide. When one of the followers was chosen, his survival instincts
triumphed over his foolishness, twisted beliefs, and psychedelic
drugs. He secretly escaped and reported to the police.
“The case was handed over to us. It was a very small mission, since
there were no Beyonders in that cult. The deity they worshiped was
actually randomly thought up by their leader merely for the sake of
money and satisfaction. Humanity was lost there.
“We only used two members, coupled with the support from the
police, to suppress this cult. No one was oﬀ the hook. For that
whistleblower, we also conﬁrmed that he had no lingering demonic
scent left on him. He was not cursed and did not suﬀer any mental
disorders. He didn’t have any personality problems or any other
irregularities, nothing.
“Later, he got a decent advancement in his career, got married to a
very good wife, had a son and a daughter. His dark past seemed far
away from him. The horror and bloodshed seemed to have
completely vanished.”
At this point, Dunn Smith gave out a laugh and said, “Yet in March
this year, despite being in good ﬁnancial health and having a loving
wife and adorable kids… he strangled himself to death in his own
oﬃce.”
The crimson moonlight outside the carriage window shone upon
Dunn Smith.
At that instance, his seemingly self-derisive smile made Klein feel
unspeakably horriﬁed.
“Strangled himself to death…” Klein drew in a gasp of cool air
silently, as if seeing his own tragic end.
Even if I escaped it once, it might just be temporary?
Is there any way to resolve this completely?
Become a Beyonder to ﬁght it?
The carriage returned to silence. Countless thoughts welled in Klein’s
mind.
Under an awkward silence, the carriage traveled for a long time at
high speeds.
Just as Klein made up his mind to consult Dunn Smith for any
solutions, the carriage came to a halt.
“Mr. Smith, we have reached Welch’s apartment.” The carriage
driver’s voice was heard.
“Let’s get down.” Dunn straightened out his black coat that reached
his knees.
“Oh, let me introduce beforehand, the oﬃcial disguise of the ‘expert’
is the most renowned spirit medium of Awwa County.”
Klein suppressed his other thoughts and asked curiously, “Then what
is her actual identity?”
Dunn half-turned his body and turned his head back, with his
abstruse gray eyes he said, “A true Spirit Medium.”
Chapter 14: The Medium
A true medium… Klein repeated this description inwardly, and did not
speak again. He followed Dunn Smith down the carriage.
Welch’s place in Tingen was a detached house with a garden. The
road outside the hollowed metal gates allowed four carriages to pass
through at once. Street lamps lined the sides of the road every ﬁfty
meters. They looked diﬀerent from the ones Klein had seen in his
previous life. They were gas lamps and the height of every lamp was
about that of an adult male so that it was convenient to light the
lamps.
The black metal was closely appressed to the glass, forming a
checkered pattern, casting out classical paper lantern-like ‘artworks.’
Coldness and warmth were intertwined while darkness and light
coexisted.
Walking along the pathway blanketed by rays from the sunset, Klein
and Dunn Smith entered Welch’s rented place through the ajar metal
gate.
Facing the main entrance was a cemented road that led straight to a
two-ﬂoored bungalow. Two carriages could go at once.
There was a garden on the left and a lawn to the right. The pleasantly
faint fragrance from the ﬂowers mixed with the cool scent of the
fresh grass made one feel happy and relaxed.
As soon as he stepped in, Klein shivered and peered around.
He felt that in the garden, somewhere in the lawn, on the roof,
behind the swing, somewhere in a dark corner, pairs of eyes were
observing him!
There was clearly no one here; yet, Klein felt as if he was on a
crowded street.
This strange contrast—this peculiar feeling—tensed him up. A chill
ran up his spine.
“Something’s wrong!” he couldn’t help but exclaim to Dunn.
Dunn’s expression remained unchanged as he walked beside him and
replied calmly, “Just ignore them.”
Since the “Nighthawk” had said so, Klein tolerated the chilling
feeling of not being able to notice the perpetrator despite being
followed, spied, and observed. Step by step, he arrived at the main
entrance of the bungalow.
If this goes on any longer, I will go crazy… As Dunn reached out his
hand to knock on the door, Klein quickly turned around. Flowers
swayed in the wind, without a person in sight.
“Come in, gentlemen.” A seemingly ethereal voice came from inside
the house.
Dunn turned the doorknob, pushed the door open and said to a
woman on the sofa, “Daly, any results?”
The chandelier in the living room was unlit. A set of two leather
couches surrounded a marble coﬀee table.
On the table was a lit candle, but the light emitted a cobalt blue
glow. It covered the half-enclosed living room, dining room, and
kitchen in a strange, eerie hue.
On the middle of the sofa sat a lady in a hooded black robe who wore
blue eyeshadow and blush. An exposed silver bracelet with a hanging
white crystal pendant was worn around her wrist.
At the ﬁrst sight of her, Klein had an inexplicable feeling. She was
dressed just like a real medium…
Was she stereotyping herself?
Daly, the “medium” with uncanny beauty, took a quick glance at
Klein with her twinkling emerald eyes. She looked at Dunn Smith and
said, “The original spirits have all disappeared, including that of
Welch’s and Naya’s. Right now, all these little rascals know nothing
at all.”
Spirits? Spirit Medium… All the invisible things that were spying on him
previously were spirits? There were so many of them? Klein removed his
hat and placed it across his chest, bowing slightly as he said, “Good
evening, Madam.”
Dunn Smith sighed. “That’s tricky…”
“Daly, this is Klein Moretti. See if you can get anything out of him.”
The medium, Daly, shifted her gaze onto Klein immediately. She
pointed at a single armchair and said, “Please, take a seat.”
“Thank you.” Klein nodded, took a few steps over, and sat down
obediently. His heart raced uncontrollably.
Whether I survive, whether I get through this successfully or have my
secrets exposed will all depend on whatever happens next!
And the thing that made him feel the most helpless was that he had
nothing to rely on. He could only place his hopes on his inherent
specialness…
This feeling really sucks… Klein thought bitterly.
Next, Dunn sat on the two-seater sofa opposite of Klein. Daly took out
two thumb-sized glass bottles from her waist pouch.
Her emerald eyes smiled at Klein as she said, “I need a bit of help
here. After all, you are not an enemy, I can’t treat you harshly. That
might make you uncomfortable or put you in pain. It might even
leave some serious after-eﬀects on you. I will give you some
fragrances, making you feel tender and smooth, which will allow you
to let loose bit by bit so that you can truly indulge in those feelings.”
That sounded wrong… Klein gaped as his eyes were ﬁlled with shock.
Seated across him, Dunn laughed and said, “Don’t be weirded out.
We are diﬀerent from the fellows from the Church of the Lord of
Storms. Here, the ladies can also verbally tease men. In this regard,
you should be able to understand. Your mother was a devout believer
of the Goddess. You and your brother used to attend Sunday school at
Church.”
“I understand. It’s just that I never thought that she would be such
a… such a…” Klein gestured, as he could not ﬁnd the right words. He
almost blurted out the direct translation for “veteran driver 1 “.
Dunn curved the corners of his mouth up and said, “Don’t worry.
Actually, Daly seldom does this. She just wants to use these methods
to calm you down. She prefers corpses over men.”
“You make me sound perverted,” Daly interjected with a smile.
She opened one of the little bottles and dripped a few drops onto the
bright blue candle ﬂame.
“Night vanilla, slumber ﬂower, and chamomile, all distilled and
extracted to form this aromatic ﬂoral essence. I call it ‘Amantha;’ it
means tranquility in the Hermes language. It smells really amazing.”
As they chatted, the candle ﬂame ﬂickered, evaporating the ﬂoral
essence and ﬁlling the room with its aroma.
A beautifully enchanting aroma found its way into Klein’s nostrils. He
no longer felt tensed up. He was instantly calm as if he was gazing
into the darkness of the silent night.
“This bottle is called the Eye of the Spirit. Barks and leaves of drago
and poplar trees are sun-dried for seven days and decocted thrice.
Then, they are immersed in Lanti Wine. Of course, there would be
several incantations while we’re at it…” As Daly described the liquid,
the amber substance dripped onto the cobalt blue candle ﬂame.
Upon smelling the ethereal scent of the aromatic wine, Klein noticed
that the candle ﬂame was dancing wildly. The luster of Daly’s blue
eyeshadow and blush shone oddly, to the extent of him seeing
double.
“It is a great helping hand for mediumship. It is also a ﬂoral essence
that is suﬃciently enchanting… ”
As Daly explained continuously, Klein felt as if her voice was coming
from all around.
Bewildered, Klein looked around and realized that everything was
swaying and in a blur. He felt like he was shrouded by layers and
layers of fog. Even his body was swaying as it phased away before he
began ﬂoating and then losing his balance.
Colors blended like an impressionist painting—the reds were redder,
the blues were bluer, and the blacks were blacker—appearing more
deﬁned than usual. It was dreamy and hazy. Distinct murmurs from
the surroundings came through as if hundreds and thousands of
people who could not be seen were debating.
“This feels similar to the luck enhancement ritual I did before, but
without the kind of madness that makes your head feel like
exploding…” Klein looked around and thought questioningly.
At this moment, his vision was locked onto a pair of eyes that were
crystal clear like emerald. On a blurry “sofa” sat Daly in a black robe.
Eccentrically, her gaze concentrated on the tip of Klein’s head. She
smiled and in a gentle voice, said, “Let me properly introduce myself.
I am the Spirit Medium, Daly.”
I can still… have rational thoughts… It’s like when I was at that luck
enhancement ritual and that gathering… The thought crossed Klein’s
mind as he intentionally behaved muddled and said, “Hello there…”
“The mental worlds of humans are extremely vast. Many secrets are
hidden within the mind. Look at the ocean—what we know about it
is all on the superﬁcial level. But in reality, deep in the ocean, there
is a larger unseen portion. Other than islands, there is the entire
ocean. There is the boundless sky that symbolizes the spiritual
world…
“You are the spirit of your body. Not only do you know of the islands
above, but you also know of the things hidden beneath the sea, as
well as the entire ocean…
“Anything that exists leaves some traces behind. The superﬁcial
memories of the islands may be wiped out, but what is left under the
sea and the entire ocean will deﬁnitely have a corresponding
projection left in it…”
Daly went on and on, bewitching Klein. The vague surrounding winds
and shadows took on similar forms. It as though Klein’s spirit was
fully exposed in the form of an ocean, waiting for him to search and
discover.
Klein watched patiently, as he ‘churned’ the ocean occasionally.
Then, in an airy voice, he replied, “No… I can’t remember… I have
forgotten…”
He expressed his agony at just the right level.
Daly tried to guide him once again, but the clear-headed Klein was
unaﬀected.
“Okay. We shall end here. You may leave.”
“Leave.”
“Leave…”
The airy voice lingered and Daly disappeared. The wind and shadows
began calming as the ethereal smell and subtle scent of the aromatic
wine became more distinct again.
The colors returned to their normal state and the fuzzy feeling was no
longer around. Klein’s body quivered, and he found his balance
again.
He opened his eyes, which he had no memory of closing, and noticed
that the candle with the bright blue ﬂame was still before him. Dunn
Smith was still resting comfortably on the couch. Same for Daly with
the black-hooded robe.
“Why did you use the theory that belongs to that bunch of evil
madmen, the Psychology Alchemists?” Dunn furrowed his eyebrows
and stared at Daly.
As Daly put away the two little bottles, she replied calmly, “I think
it’s pretty accurate. At least, it corresponds with some of the things
I’ve made contact with before…”
Without waiting for Dunn’s reply, Daly shrugged and said, “This
tricky fellow did not leave a single trace behind.”
Upon hearing this, Klein heaved a huge sigh of relief. Pretentiously,
he asked, “Oh, it’s over? What happened? It felt like I just took a
nap…”
That was a pass, right?
Thankfully, I had the ‘luck enhancement ritual’ as a rehearsal!
“Just take it as such.” Dunn interrupted him and looked at Daly.
“Have you examined Welch’s and Naya’s bodies?”
“The corpses can tell us a lot more than you can imagine. It’s such a
pity that Welch and Naya had indeed committed suicide. So, the
force that drove them to it is to be feared. Not a single trace was left
behind.” Daly stood up and pointed at the candle. “I need some rest.”
The cobalt blue glow vanished, and the house was instantly
inundated with a blurry shade of crimson.
…
“Congratulations. You can return home now. But do remember, do
not reveal this incident to your loved ones. You have to promise
this.” Dunn said as he led Klein to the door.
Surprised, Klein asked, “Is there no need to examine the curses or the
trails left behind by the evil spirits?”
“Daly didn’t mention anything about it, so there’s no need for it,”
Dunn answered simply.
Klein calmed down. As the thought of his previous worries came to
mind, he asked hurriedly, “How can I be sure that I will be free from
trouble from now on?”
“No worries.” Dunn twitched his lips and said, “Based on statistics of
similar incidents in the past, eighty percent of the survivors of the
incident do not experience any horrifying after-eﬀects. Yeah… This is
based on what I know… roughly… more or less…”
“Then… there’s still one ﬁfth of those poor souls…” Klein did not
dare to try his luck.
“Then you can consider joining us as a civilian staﬀ. This way, even if
there are any precursors, we can discover it in time,” Dunn said
casually as he approached the carriage. “Or simply become a
Beyonder. After all, we are not nannies. We can’t babysit you all day
long and even watch what you do with women.”
“Can I?” Klein questioned the statement.
Of course, he did not expect much. After all, how was it even possible
to be a part of the Nighthawks so easily and obtain the power of the
Beyonders?
That was the power of the Beyonders!
Dunn paused, and turned his head sideways to look at him.
“It’s not that you can’t… It depends…”
What? The transition in his words shocked Klein. Klein stared blankly
beside the carriage before answering, “Really?”
Who are you kidding? Is it so easy to become a Beyonder?
Dunn laughed lightly; his gray eyes were hidden in the shadow of the
carriage.
“You don’t believe me, huh? Actually, when you become a
Nighthawk you lose a lot. For instance, freedom.
“Even if we don’t talk about this now, there is another issue. Firstly,
you are not a member of the clergy, nor a devotee. You can’t pick
whatever you want or choose the safest approach.”
“And secondly…” Dunn held onto the handle and hopped onto the
carriage as he went on. “Among the cases that we—us, the Mandated
Punisher, the Machinery Hivemind and other Judiciaries—have to
deal with annually, a quarter of them were a result of Beyonders who
lost control.”
A quarter… Beyonders who lost control… Klein was dumbfounded.
Just then, Dunn turned slightly. His gray eyes were deep. With no
sign of a smile, he continued, “And among the quarter of cases, a
large number of them are our teammates.”
Chapter 15: The Invitation
A wave of tumultuous emotions rose up in Klein’s heart after he
heard Dunn. Instinctively, he uttered, “Why?”
The Beyonders have serious hidden dangers? So much so that the Church’s
internal Judiciary and the Beyonders, who dealt with bizarre
phenomenon, are also prone to problems?
Dunn stepped into the carriage and sat back in his seat. His
expression and tone remained the same.
“This is not something that you need to understand. Neither is it
something you can understand, unless you become one of us.”
Klein was struck dumb for a moment, after which he sat down and
questioned in a tone that was half dubious and half-joking.
“If I don’t come to understand, how is it possible for me to make a
decision to join?”
And not joining would mean Klein could not understand. This would
end in a deadlock…
Dunn Smith took out the pipe once again, placed it against his nose,
and took a whiﬀ.
“You probably misunderstood; a civilian staﬀ member is also one of
us.”
“In other words, as long as I become one of your civilian staﬀ
members, I will be able to understand the relevant secrets, ﬁgure out
the hidden dangers that plague Beyonders, and the dangers that may
be encountered, as well as consider whether I want to become a
Beyonder later?” Klein reorganized his thoughts and paraphrased
what Dunn had shared.
Dunn smiled and said, “Yes, that is the case, except for one point.
You cannot simply become a Beyonder just because you want to
because every church will be equally strict in this aspect.”
It would be odd if the churches were not strict… Klein lampooned
silently, as he added with a more intense tone coupled with stronger
body language, “What about civilian staﬀ members? This should be
quite strict as well, right?”
“There shouldn’t be any problems if it’s you,” said Dunn with half-
closed eyelids as he whiﬀed the pipe with partially relaxed
countenance. However, he did not ignite it.
“Why?” Klein asked as he was once again grappled by doubt.
At the same time, he jested inwardly.
So my uniqueness and halo as a transmigrator are akin to the ﬁreﬂies in
the night, ever so bright and outstanding?
Dunn opened his half-closed eyelids, his silver-colored eyes reﬂecting
the same tranquility as before.
“First, you managed to survive without our help in such a situation.
Certain exceptional qualities are not present in others. For instance,
luck. Lucky people are often welcomed.”
Seeing that Klein’s expression had turned blank, Dunn smiled slightly.
“All right, just treat this as a humorous statement. Second, you’re a
graduate of the history department from Khoy University; this is
something we urgently need. Although a believer of the Lord of the
Storms, Leumi, perceives women in a way that is loathsome, his
views regarding society, humanities, economics, and politics remain
incisive. He said before that talents are key to maintaining a
competitive advantage and positive development, a point that I very
much agree with.
Noticing that Klein was slightly furrowing his eyebrows, Dunn
casually explained, “You should be able to imagine that we often
encounter documents and objects from the Fourth Epoch or earlier.
Many cults and heretics have tried to gain power from these things.
Sometimes, they themselves can lead to strange and terrible things.
“Except for the Beyonders in special ﬁelds, most of us are not good
with our studies, or have passed that age.” Having said that, Dunn
Smith pointed to his own head, and the corner of his mouth turned
up slightly as if he was mocking himself.
He then said, “Those dry, boring knowledge always puts us to sleep.
Even the Sleepless can’t help it. In the past, we would cooperate with
historians or archaeologists, but this posed the risk of exposing
secrets, and mishaps might befall on these otherwise uninvolved
professors and associate professors. Thus, the addition of a
professional in our ranks is hard to refuse.”
Klein nodded lightly and accepted Dunn’s explanation. With his
thoughts all over the place, he asked, “Then why don’t you directly,
um, groom one?”
Dunn continued, “This brings me to the third point, which is also the
ﬁnal and most important point. You’ve already been through a
similar ordeal, so inviting you doesn’t violate the conﬁdentiality
clause.
“With regard to developing others, I will bear the responsibility of
exposure if it fails. Most of our team members, our civilian staﬀ
members, come from within the Church.”
After Klein ﬁnished listening silently, he asked curiously, “Why are
you so strict about maintaining conﬁdentiality? Wouldn’t spreading
the news publicly to more people and increasing awareness lessen the
chances of a similar mistake from happening again? The greatest fear
stems from the fear of the unknown; we can make the unknown
become known.”
“No, humanity’s stupidity is beyond your imagination. It actually
leads to more people emulating these acts, creating more chaos and
more severe incidents,” Dunn Smith shook his head and replied.
Klein acknowledged as he replied in enlightenment, “The only lesson
that humans can learn from history is that humans do not gain any
lessons from history, and they’re always repeating the same
tragedies.”
“That famous quote from Emperor Roselle is indeed ﬁlled with much
philosophical meaning,” agreed Dunn.
…Emperor Roselle said that? This transmigrator senior really did not give
the ‘latecomers’ any chance to posture… Klein did not know how to
follow up on Dunn’s words.
Dunn turned his head and gazed out of the horse carriage. The dim
yellowish light of the street lamps intertwined to display the splendor
of civilization.
“…There is a similar discourse within the judiciary of the major
churches. This may be the main reason for the strict conﬁdentiality
and the prohibition of ordinary people from knowing.”
“What is it?” Klein asked as his interest was piqued, pleasured that he
seemed to be spying on secrets.
Dunn turned his head; his facial muscles pulled themselves so slightly
that it was hardly visible.
“Faith and fear bring troubles. More faith and more fear bring more
troubles, until everything is destroyed.”
After he said that, Dunn signed, “Besides praying for the blessings
and help from gods, humans can’t solve their real major problems.
“Faith and fear bring troubles. More faith and more fear bring more
troubles…” Klein recited silently, but he could not fully understand
it.
What followed next was the fear of uncertainty that came from the
unknown. It was like the dark shadows formed by the street lights
outside. In the darkness without light, it appeared as though there
were pairs of callous-looking eyes and wide-opened mouths.
As the horse galloped vigorously and nimbly while the wheels of the
horse carriage reeled on ahead with Iron Cross Street in sight, Dunn
broke the silence suddenly and formally invited Klein.
“Would you like to join us as a civilian staﬀ member?”
In Klein’s mind, multiple thoughts surfaced, making him indecisive.
He contemplated and asked, “Can I have some time to consider?”
Since this matter had serious implications, he could not hastily and
recklessly make the decision.
“No problem, just give me a reply before Sunday,” Dunn nodded and
added. “Of course, remember to keep this a secret and don’t disclose
the information regarding Welch to anyone, including your brother
and sister. Once this is violated, it’ll not only bring them trouble, but
you might also have to attend a special court.”
“Okay,” Klein answered gravely.
The carriage was once again plunged into silence.
Seeing that they were nearing Iron Cross Street and that he was
almost reaching home, Klein suddenly thought of a question. He
hesitated for a few seconds before asking, “Mr Smith, what kind of
salary and beneﬁts do civilian staﬀ get?”
This was a serious question…
Taken aback momentarily, Dunn smiled instantly and answered,
“There’s no need for you to worry about this issue. Our funds are
guaranteed by the Church and the police department. For newly
registered civilian staﬀs, the weekly salaries are placed at two pounds
and ten soli. There is an additional ten soli as compensation for the
risk and conﬁdentiality. All of this will add up to a total of three
pounds. This is hardly worse than a conﬁrmed university lecturer.
“Afterwhich, your salary will gradually rise according to your
experience and contributions.
“As for civilian staﬀ members, the contract is generally ﬁve years.
After ﬁve years, you can quit normally if you’re no longer willing to
stay. You only have to sign a lifetime conﬁdentiality agreement and
you’re not allowed to leave Tingen until permission is given. If you
want to move to another city, the ﬁrst thing you must do is register
with the local Nighthawk.
“By the way, there are no weekends and you can only work in shifts.
At any point in time, there should be three civilian staﬀs on duty and
if you wish to go to the South or Desi Bay for a vacation, you’ll need
to arrange it with your colleagues.”
Just as Dunn ﬁnished speaking, the horse carriage pulled to a stop
and the apartment building where Klein and his siblings resided in
appeared on the side.
“I get it now,” Klein turned around and walked down the horse
carriage. He stopped at the side and asked, “By the way Mr. Smith,
where do I ﬁnd you after I’ve come to my decision?”
Dunn gave a deep and low throaty laugh before saying, “Go to the
‘Hound Pub’ at Besik Street and ﬁnd their boss, Wright. Tell him that
you want to hire a small mercenary squad for a mission.”
“Huh?” Klein asked confusedly.
“Our location is conﬁdential too. Before you agree to become one of
us, I can’t tell you directly. Alright Mr. Klein Moretti, I wish you a
good dream tonight as well,” Dunn smiled as he said.
Klein took oﬀ his hat and saluted, watching as the pace of the
departing horse carriage gradually sped up.
He took out his pocket watch.
“Click,” he pressed it open and saw that it was only a little past four
in the morning. The street was ﬁlled with a relaxing, cool breeze. A
dim yellowish light from the street lamps illuminated the
surroundings.
Klein drew a deep breath and took in the deep silence of the night
around him.
The busiest and noisiest district in the day could be so lifeless and
quiet at night. This was in stark contrast to the silent observations
and medium’s seance in Welch’s residence.
It was only then that Klein realized that the back of his linen shirt
was unknowingly drenched in sweat, cold and clammy.
Chapter 16: Rat-baiting With
Dogs
Phew, I ﬁnally got through the round with the medium…
Klein let out a foul breath. He slowly turned around and enjoyed the
cool breeze and tranquility of the night while walking closer and
closer to the apartment building’s door.
He took out his keys, inserted the correct one in and turned it gently,
allowing the crimson-mixed darkness to expand with the creaking
sound of the opened door.
Walking on the staircase without a single person in sight and taking
in the cold air, Klein had an inexplicable and amazing feeling. It felt
like he had a few more hours than others. This caused him to hasten
his pace.
In a similar state of mind, he opened the door to his room and before
he even stepped inside, he saw a silhouette sitting silently in front of
his desk. It had reddish black hair, bright brown eyes, and a delicate,
pretty face. Undoubtedly, she was Melissa Moretti!
“Klein, where did you go?” Melissa asked curiously as she relaxed her
eyebrows.
Without waiting for Klein’s reply, she added, “Just now, I got up to
go to the bathroom and realized you weren’t home.” It was as if she
wanted to know everything clearly, from the causes and eﬀects of the
matter to the underlying logic.
With great experience at lying to his parents, Klein’s brain took a spin
before he gave a bitter smile and calmly replied, “I couldn’t fall
asleep again after I woke up. Instead of wasting time, I decided that I
should train my body. So I went out to run a few rounds. Look at my
sweat!”
He took oﬀ his jacket and half-turned his body, pointing to his back.
Melissa stood up, took a glance half-heartedly and deliberated for a
few moments before saying, “Honestly speaking, Klein, you don’t
have to stress yourself out. I’m sure you can pass the interview to
Tingen University. Even if you can’t, er—I mean if —you can still ﬁnd
better ones.”
I haven’t even thought about the interview… Klein nodded his head and
said, “I understand.”
He did not mention the “oﬀer” that he had gotten because he had not
decided whether he wanted to join them or not.
Staring at Klein intensely, Melissa suddenly turned around and
trotted into the interior of the house. She took out an object that
resembled a tortoise. It was comprised of items like gears, rusted
iron, torsion springs and ordinary springs.
After quickly tightening the torsion spring, Melissa placed the object
on the desk.
Ka! Ka! Ka!
Dum! Dum! Dum!
The “tortoise” moved and jumped with a rhythm that could pull
anyone’s attention.
“Whenever I feel irritated, I feel much better seeing this tortoise
move. I’ve been doing this very often recently and it’s very eﬀective!
Klein, give it a try!” invited Melissa as her eyes brightened.
Klein did not turn down his sister’s goodwill. He approached the
“tortoise” and waited for it to stop before laughing. He said,
“Simplicity and regularity can indeed help relaxation.”
Without waiting for Melissa’s reply, Klein pointed to the “tortoise”
and casually asked, “Did you make this yourself? When did you make
this? Why wasn’t I aware of it?”
“I made use of unwanted materials from school and things picked up
from the streets to make this. It was only ﬁnished two days ago,”
Melissa said in her usual tone, the side of her lips upturned a few
more degrees.
“That’s impressive,” Klein praised sincerely.
As a boy with poor skills in machine assembly, he encountered great
diﬃculties even assembling a four-wheel toy car as a child.
With her chin slightly raised and her eyes slightly bent, Melissa
calmly replied, “It was okay.”
“Being overly humble is a bad trait,” Klein smiled slightly and
continued, “This is a tortoise, right?”
Instantly, the atmosphere in the room took a great plunge, leaving
behind an air of graveness for a while. Then, Melissa faintly replied
with a voice that seemed enigmatic like the crimson veil, “It’s a
puppet.”
Puppet…
Klein gave an awkward smile, and tried to forcefully explain, “The
problem lies in the materials, they’re too rudimentary.”
Following that, he tried to change the topic and said, “Why would
you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night? Isn’t there a toilet
here? Don’t you always sleep till dawn?”
Melissa was taken aback momentarily.
It was only after a few seconds, before she opened her mouth,
prepared to explain.
At that moment, an intense sound of digestion sounded from
herthoracoabdominal 1 area.
“I-I’ll go get some more sleep!”
Bang! She grabbed her tortoise-like “puppet”, trotted to the interior of
the house, and closed the door to her room.
Last night’s dinner was too good, she ate too much and now her stomach
is having trouble digesting it… Klein shook his head as he smiled,
slowly walking towards his desk. He sat down soundlessly, silently
pondering Dunn Smith’s invitation as the crimson red moon emerged
from behind the dark clouds.
Being a Nighthawk civilian staﬀ member had its apparent
disadvantages.
With me being a transmigrator, “The Fool”—initiator of the mysterious
Gathering—and the multiple secrets I have, it will be risky to be under the
noses of the Church of the Evernight Goddess’s team that specializes in
dealing with matters regarding the Beyonders.
As long as I join Dunn Smith and his team, I would certainly aim to
become a Beyonder. I could then cover up the beneﬁts gained from the
Gathering.
Yet, becoming a formal member would entail many restrictions on my
freedom, like how a civilian staﬀ has to report his leaving of Tingen. No
longer would I be able to go wherever I want or do whatever I want. I
would miss many opportunities.
The Nighthawks are a strict organization. Once a mission is given, I can
only wait for the arrangements and accept orders. There is no room for
rejection.
Beyonders have the risk of losing control.
…
Having all the disadvantages listed out one by one, Klein turned to
considering the necessities and advantages:
Judging from the situation of the luck enhancement ritual, I’m not one of
the eighty percent of lucky people. In the future, there is bound to be some
bizarre event happening to me, increasing the dangers I face.
Only by becoming one of the Beyonders or by joining the Nighthawks can
I be equipped with the ability to resist.
The wish to become a Beyonder cannot be solely reliant on the Gathering.
The potion formula is not a major problem, but where can I ﬁnd the
corresponding materials? How am I to obtain and concoct them?
Not forgetting the nous of daily practice, I’m faced with serious obstacles!
It is just not possible for me to consult Justice and The Hanged Man on
every matter and exchange every object with them. This would not only
hurt the image of The Fool and arouse their suspicions, but there will also
be inadequate time to communicate on such trivial issues.
Similarly, I am unable to produce anything that can pique their interest.
Besides, more materials would more often than not leave behind the trail
of my real identity. Then, “online disputes” would eﬀectively be
transformed into “oﬄine conﬂicts,” bringing about immense troubles.
By joining the Nighthawks, there would deﬁnitely be contact with the
common knowledge of the world of mystery and relevant channels. This
can suﬃciently accumulate into a corresponding social circle and can be
used as leverage. Only then can I initiate the Gathering and in turn gain
the greatest beneﬁts from Justice and The Hanged Man. In reality, the
gains can feedback into reality, allowing me to obtain more resources and
form a virtuous cycle.
Of course, I could also go to an organization that is suppressed by the
various Churches such as the Psychology Alchemists mentioned by Dunn
and join them.
Yet I’ll also lose my freedom, and be in a constant state of fear and
anxiety. However, more importantly, I have no idea where to look for
them. Even if I manage to gain the corresponding information from The
Hanged Man, such rash contact with them could endanger my life.
Becoming a civilian staﬀ leaves opportunity for a buﬀer and exit.
The inferior recluse hides away in the wild; the superior, the crowd.
Perhaps the identity as a Nighthawk can be a better cover.
In the future, when I become one of the top authorities of the tribunal,
who would imagine that I am a heretic, the head of the secret organization
who is working behind the scenes?
…
As the ﬁrst rays of the morning sun shone, the crimson disappeared.
Gazing at the golden light on the horizons of the sky, Klein made up
his mind.
He would ﬁnd Dunn Smith today and become part of the Nighthawk’s
civilian staﬀ!
At this moment, Melissa, who had gotten out of bed again, had
pushed open the door to the room. She was surprised to see her
brother stretching in an unglamorous manner. “You didn’t sleep?”
“I was thinking through some things.” Klein smiled, feeling relaxed.
Melissa thought for a moment and said, “Whenever I encounter
problems, I’ll list out both the pros and cons one by one and compare
them. After that, I would be able to get a hint of what I should do
next.”
“That’s a good habit. I did that too,” Klein smiled and replied.
Melissa’s countenance was relaxed, and she did not add more.
Holding a yellowish sheet of paper and her toiletries, she headed to
the bathroom.
Not in a hurry to leave after he ﬁnished his breakfast and his sister’s
departure, Klein took a good nap. Based on what he knew, nearly all
the pubs were closed in the morning.
At two o’clock in the afternoon, he smoothed the pleats of his silk hat
and handkerchief using a small brush. He also removed the dirt to
reestablish the tidiness.
Thereafter, he wore a suit of formal clothing, just like he was going
for an interview.
Besik Street was a little far, and Klein was afraid that he would miss
the “working hours” of the Nighthawk. Therefore, he did not walk
there, but instead waited for public horse carriage at Iron Cross
Street.
In the Loen Kingdom, public horse carriages were placed under two
categories—without track and with track.
The former consisted of a carriage drawn by two horses and could sit
approximately 20 people while taking into account the top of the
carriage. Only a general route existed, without speciﬁc stations. It
had ﬂexible operations and could be hailed anywhere unless it was
full.
The latter was operated by the Orbital Carriage Company. First, a
rail-like service device was laid on the main street. The horses would
move on the inner lane while the wheels ran on the tracks, making it
easier and more labor-saving. This could thus pull a bigger double-
decker carriage that sat nearly ﬁfty passengers.
However, the only problem was that the route and stations were
ﬁxed, making many places inaccessible.
After ten minutes, the sound of the wheels hitting the tracks
approached from a distance. A double-decker horse carriage stopped
in front of the station at Iron Cross Street.
“To Besik Street,” Klein said to the carriage driver.
“You have to transfer at Champagne Street but when you get there, it
takes about ten minutes to walk to Besik Street,” explained the
carriage driver to Klein, with regards to the route.
“Let’s go to Champagne Street then.” Klein nodded in approval.
“It’s more than four kilometers, four pence”, said a young man with a
fair and clean face, as he extended his hand.
He was a worker responsible for money collection.
“Okay.” Klein ﬁshed out four copper coins from his pocket and
handed it to the other party.
He walked up to the carriage and found that there were not many
passengers. Even on the ﬁrst ﬂoor, there were a few empty seats.
“I only have three pence on me now, so I can only walk when I go
back…” Klein pressed his hat down and sat down ﬁrmly.
On this ﬂoor, the men and women were mostly well-dressed although
there were a few clothed in their work clothes, leisurely reading
newspapers. Almost no one spoke, and it was quite quiet.
Klein shut his eyes and recharged his strength, oblivious to the
coming and going of passengers around him.
Station after station passed until he ﬁnally heard the few words
“Champagne Street.”
After alighting the horse carriage, he inquired along the way and
soon reached Besik Street, where he saw the pub with the brownish-
yellow hound logo.
Klein reached out his right hand and gave a forceful push. The heavy
door gradually opened, inundating him with a wave of uproarious
noises and an impetuous heat wave.
Although it was still afternoon, there were already many customers in
the pub. Some were temporary workers, looking for opportunities
here, waiting to be hired. Others were simply idling around, numbing
themselves with alcohol.
The pub was dimly lit. In the center, there were two large iron cages
with a third of its bottom sinking deep into the ground without any
gaps.
People held wooden wine cups and surrounded it, sometimes
discussing loudly while laughing, sometimes cursing loudly.
Giving a curious glance, Klein found two dogs caged inside. One was
black and white, similar to the husky found on Earth. The other was
wholly black, with shiny fur, making it look healthy and ﬁerce.
“Do you want to bet? Doug has won eight games in a row!” said a
little man wearing a brown beret, as he neared Klein and pointed to
the black dog.
Bet? Taken aback at ﬁrst, Klein regained his senses immediately.
“Dog-ﬁghting?”
When he was at Khoy University, those aristocratic and wealthy
students would always ask him contemptuously and curiously, if the
boorish workers and unemployed hooligans enjoyed participating in
boxing and gambling at the pubs.
Besides being able to gamble on boxing and card games, didn’t it also
include cruel and bloody activities like cock-ﬁghting, dog-ﬁghting,
and others?
The short man smirked. “Mister, we’re civilized people. We don’t
engage in such unglamorous activities.”
Having said that, he whispered, “Besides, laws were introduced to
ban these things last year…”
“Then what are y’all betting on?” asked Klein curiously.
“The better hunter.” Just as the short man ﬁnished his sentence, a
resounding cacophony sounded.
He turned his head, waved his hands excitedly, and said, “You can’t
place a bet for this round as it has started, wait for the next one
then.”
Upon hearing that, Klein tipped his toes, lifted his head, and looked
as far as he could.
He saw two strong men each dragging a sack, coming to the side of
the iron cage and opening the “prison door.” They then dumped the
contents of the sack into the cage.
There were gray and disgusting animals!
Klein tried to identify them carefully before realizing that they were
rats. Hundreds of rats!
As the iron cage was deep underground without any gaps, the rats
moved in all directions but could not ﬁnd a way out.
Right then, just as the door of the cage was closed, the chain of the
two dogs were untied.
“Woof!” The black dog pounced ahead and killed a rat in one bite.
The black-and-white dog was dazed at ﬁrst before it started playing
excitedly with the rats.
The surrounding people either raised their wine cups and intensiﬁed
their gaze or shouted loudly, “Bite it! Kill it!”
“Doug, Doug!”
Motherf**king rat-baiting with dogs 2 … Klein regained his senses and
the corner of his mouth twitched unceasingly.
The objective of the gamble is to determine which dog can catch more
rats…
Perhaps, one can even bet on the speciﬁc number of rats caught…
No wonder there were people purchasing live rats at Iron Cross Street…
That’s really unique…
Klein shook his head, laughing as he backtracked, and circled along
the edge of the alcoholic customers, and reached the front of the bar.
“New here?” said the bartender as he spared Klein a glance while
wiping the cups. He continued, “One cup of rye beer is a penny.
Enmat beer, costs two pence. Four pence for Southville beer, or do
you want a cup of purely brewed malt Lanti?”
“I came here for Mr. Wright,” said Klein directly and bluntly.
The bartender whistled and shouted to the side, “Old Man, someone
is looking for you.”
“Oh, who…” A vague voice sounded, and an intoxicated old man
stood up from behind the bar.
He rubbed his eyes, shifted his gaze to Klein and asked, “Lad, were
you looking for me?”
“Mr. Wright, I would like to hire a small mercenary squad for a
mission,” replied Klein, according to what Dunn had instructed.
“A small mercenary squad? Are you living in an adventure story?
This hasn’t been around for a long time!” the bartender interrupted
and smiled.
Wright went silent for a few second before saying, “Who told you to
look for it here?”
“Dunn. Dunn Smith,” replied Klein in all honesty.
Instantly, Wright broke out in a chuckle and replied, “I see. Actually,
the small mercenary squad still exists. It’s just in another form, with a
more contemporary name. You can ﬁnd it on the second ﬂoor of No.
36 Zouteland Street.”
“Thank you,” thanked Klein sincerely before he turned and squeezed
out of the pub.
Before he went out the pub, the alcoholic customers who surrounded
him suddenly quieted down, as they murmured, “Doug was actually
defeated…”
“Defeated…”
Klein smiled and shook his head. Then he left quickly and found his
way to the nearby Zoeterland Street after asking around.
“30, 32, 34… Here,” he counted the house numbers and walked into
the stairwell.
Going around the corner and slowly climbing up the stairs, he saw
the vertical sign with the current name of the so-called small
mercenary squad.
“Blackthorn Security Company.”
Chapter 17: Special Operations
Department
“Blackthorn Security Company.”
Upon seeing the signboard, Klein felt surprised yet found it
reasonable.
Man… what do I say about this… He shook his head and laughed
before walking up the steps and knocking gently on the half-closed
door with his right hand.
Knock! Knock! Knock!
The sound echoed slowly but rhythmically, but there was no
response; only a faint sputtering sound could be heard.
Knock! Knock! Knock!
Klein repeated, only to be met with the same outcome.
He switched to pushing the door, making the gap larger as he stared
inside—a classic sofa which might have been for serving guests, a soft
fabric armchair, and a burly wood coﬀee table. There was a girl with
brown hair behind a table right across with her head drooped.
Even though “Security Company” is just a guise, isn’t this just… just too
“unprofessional?” How long has this place been out of business? Right,
you guys don’t need any business… Klein drew closer as he complained
silently and knocked on the table just beside the girl’s ear.
Knock! Knock!
The brown-haired girl sat up immediately and swiftly took the
newspaper in front of her, covering her face.
Tingen City Honest Paper… Nice name… Klein silently read the title of
the page facing him.
“The steam train service ‘Soaring Express’ that directly reaches
Constant City is starting operations today… Oh come on, when will
there be one that goes straight to Brindisi Bay. I really don’t want to
take the ship there again, it’s too awful, really awful… Hey, who are
you?” The girl with brown hair read pretentiously and gave her
opinion. As she spoke, she lowered the newspaper and revealed her
bright forehead and light-brown eyes, looking at Klein with a
fawning and startled look.
“Hello, I am Klein Moretti, and I am here at the invitation of Dunn
Smith,” Klein said as he took down his hat to his chest and bowed
slightly.
The brown-haired girl looked to be in her early twenties. She wore a
light green, Loen-styled dress. She was set oﬀ with beautiful laces on
her sleeves, collar, and chest.
“The Captain… alright, wait here for a moment. I’ll go get him.” The
girl scurried up and went into the room beside her.
She didn’t even serve a cup of water or anything… The level of service
awareness is worrying… Klein smiled faintly as he waited at his spot.
After two to three minutes, the brown-haired girl opened the door
and came out. She said with a sweet smile, “Mr. Moretti, please
follow me. The Captain is on watch at the ‘Chanis Gate’ and is unable
to leave at the moment.”
“Okay.” Klein quickly followed behind. In his mind, he pondered to
himself.
Chanis Gate, what could that be?
Going through the partition, the ﬁrst thing he saw was a small
corridor, with only three oﬃces on each side.
Some of these oﬃces were locked tight, while some were opened,
revealing someone on the inside who typed non-stop on a heavy
mechanical typewriter.
At a glance, Klein noticed a familiar ﬁgure: the young oﬃcer that had
investigated his apartment, the one with the black hair and blue eye
and romantic vibe of a poet.
He was not in oﬃcial wear; his white collared shirt was not tucked
in, making for quite an unruly appearance.
Perhaps he really is a poet… Klein nodded in greeting and was greeted
with a smile.
The brown-haired girl pushed opened the left oﬃce door at the end
of the room and pointed inside, chirping, “We still have to go down a
few levels.”
This oﬃce had no furniture in place, only a grayish-white stone
staircase that extended downwards.
The two sides of the stairs were lit up by gas lamps. The stable glow
dispelled the darkness and gave a sense of harmony.
The brown-haired girl walked in front, staring at her feet while
walking carefully.
“Although I walk here often, I am still constantly afraid of falling
down, tumbling down like a barrel. You don’t know, Leonard did
such a folly. On the ﬁrst day of becoming a ‘Sleepless’—the ﬁrst day
where he had not mastered his new powers—he tried to rush down
the ﬂight of stairs. And-and he became a cartwheel. Haha, it was
hilarious if you think about it. Oh yes, it was the guy that greeted
you just now. This was about three years ago. Speaking of which, I
have been with the Nighthawks for ﬁve years; I was only seventeen
when I joined…”
The girl watched her steps as she spoke. Suddenly, she smacked her
forehead and said, “I forgot to introduce myself! I’m Rozanne. My
father was a member of the Nighthawks, who sacriﬁced himself in an
accident ﬁve years ago. I suppose we are colleagues from now on—
Err, yeah ‘colleague’ is the right word… we are not teammates since
we are not Beyonders.”
“I hope to have the honor, but still it depends on what Mr. Smith has
to say,” Klein said as he sized up the enclosed surroundings. He felt
that they were going underground—dampness seeped out from the
stone walls, dispelling the summer heat.
“Don’t worry, the fact that you came so far means the Captain has
agreed. I’ve always been a little afraid of him, even though he is
amiable, a fatherly ﬁgure. I don’t know why but I’m still afraid.”
Rozanne spoke as though there was a piece of sweet in her throat.
Klein answered humorously, “Isn’t being afraid of a father normal?”
“True.” Rozanne said as she held the wall around the bend.
As they spoke, the two ﬁnished walking down the stairs and reached
a stone-paved ﬂoor.
It was a long aisle; both sides of the walls were mounted with gas
lamps surrounded by metal gratings. Klein and Rozanne’s shadows
were elongated under the illumination.
Klein keenly noticed that there was a “Dark Sacred Emblem” every
few meters—the symbol of the Evernight Goddess. A deep black
background dotted with sparkling embellishments, as they clustered
precisely half the crimson moon.
These emblems did not seem special, but walking between them gave
Klein a sense of serenity. Rozanne also stopped talking, unlike her
previous talkative state.
Before long, an intersection appeared up front. Rozanne brieﬂy
introduced,
“The path to the left will lead to the Saint Selena Cathedral; to the
right are the armory, storeroom, and archives. And straight ahead is
the Chanis Gate.”
Saint Selena Cathedral? Then, Zouteland Street is just behind Red
Moonlight Street?Klein was a little stunned.
Saint Selena Cathedral of Red Moonlight Street was the headquarters
of the Church of the Evernight Goddess in Tingen, a sacred ground
where local followers yearned to visit. Along with “Holy Numerics
Cathedral” of the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery in the
suburbs, and the “River and Sea Cathedral” of the Church of the Lord
of Storms in North Tingen, they sustained the religious circles in
Tingen city and its aﬃliated towns and villages.
Aware that his status made it unsuitable for him to ask more, Klein
only listened silently.
They passed the intersection and moved straight ahead. In less than a
minute, a black iron split gate carved with seven sacred emblems
were seen.
It stood there, heavy, cold and domineering, like a giant guarding in
the darkness.
“Chanis Gate.” Rozanne reminded him and pointed at the room
beside them, saying, “Captain is inside. Go on in by yourself.”
“Alright, thank you.” Klein replied politely.
The room Rozanne was referring to was just in front of “Chanis
Gate.” The windows were opened, revealing the lit room inside. Klein
took a deep breath to calm himself.
Knock! Knock! Knock!
“Come in.” He heard Dunn Smith’s deep and amiable voice.
Klein opened the unlatched door gently. There was only a table and
four chairs inside. Dunn Smith with his high hairline, who was
wearing the black coat from the previous night plus a gold watch
chain around his chest, was reading the newspaper leisurely.
“Come and have a seat. Have you decided? Are you certain you want
to join us?” Dunn smiled and asked as he put down the newspaper.
Klein removed his hat and bowed, then he sat beside the table and
said, “Yes, I am certain.”
“Then take a look at this deed, heh heh. People like to call it a
contract now.” Dunn pulled out the table drawer and took out two
contract copies.
There were not many clauses, and most of them had been mentioned
by Dunn Smith. The emphasis was on the conﬁdential clause.
Violators were tried in the tribunal courts of the Church of the
Evernight Goddess instead of the kingdom’s courts. It was akin to
how soldiers and oﬃcers were sent to court martial for trials.
A ﬁve year contract… Two pounds and ten soli for weekly wages, ten soli
as compensation for the risk and conﬁdentiality… Klein read through it
and answered resolutely, “I’ve no problem with it.”
“Then sign it,” Dunn said as he pointed to the dark red fountain pen
and ink.
Klein used a piece of waste paper to try out the pen before drawing a
breath. He signed on both contracts with his name: Klein Moretti.
As he did not have a stamp yet, he could only use his thumbprint.
Dunn received the contract, took out a stamp from the drawer, and
stamped on the end of the contract and a few key parts.
With that done, he stood up and returned a contract with one hand,
and reached for Klein with the other saying, “Welcome, from now on,
you are one of us, and please note that the contract is conﬁdential as
well.”
Klein stood up as well. He received the contract, shook his hand, and
said, “So, I shall be addressing you as Captain?”
“Yes.” Dunn’s grayish eyes seemed especially deep in the dim
surroundings.
After shaking hands, they sat down. Klein glanced at the stamp on
the contract, it read: “Nighthawks Squad, Tingen City, Awwa County,
Loen Kingdom.”
“I can’t believe you guys would use the name ‘Blackthorn Security
Company’ as a disguise,” he laughed and said.
“Actually, we have other signboards.” Dunn pulled out a piece of
paper from the drawer.
It was stamped with the stamps of the city government and the police
department. The content were as follows: “Seventh Unit, Special
Operations Department, Awwa County Police, Loen Kingdom.”
“The ﬁrst four units are the regular police responsible for general
security, like the VIP Protection Unit and Key Installations Protection
Unit. And from unit ﬁve onwards are the ones dealing with
supernatural incidents in each city. Our unit is responsible for
incidents related to the followers of Evernight Goddess in Tingen. If
there are diﬀerent types of followers, then we divide the area
accordingly; we are mainly in charge of places like the north, west
and the Golden Indus region.”
Dunn brieﬂy introduced, “Unit Six of the Mandated Punisher squad
under the Church of the Lord of Storms is in charge of the pier
region, the east, and the south. The university area and the suburbs
are under Unit Five, which is the Machinery Hivemind squad in
Tingen.”
“Right.” Klein had no questions about it. He then laughed. “What
happens if someone really comes here due to the ‘Blackthorn Security
Company’ signboard and requests for our services?”
“We’ll take those requests; why shouldn’t we? As long as it doesn’t
aﬀect our daily operations,” Dunn said slowly and humorously. “Any
earnings would be considered additional bonuses, so our members
are quite willing to take those jobs. Anyway, the market for trivial
and troublesome matters such as ﬁnding dogs and cats have been
monopolized by private detectives.”
“So how many people are there in this Nighthawks squad?” Klein
asked since they were on this topic.
“There aren’t many supernatural incidents, so there are even fewer
Beyonders. There are only six formal members of the Nighthawks in
the entire Tingen City, including me. Heh heh, as for civilian staﬀ,
there are six including you.”
Klein nodded his head, and eventually asked the question that he was
most concerned about, “So, Captain, what do you mean by Beyonders
losing control? Why does it happen?”
Chapter 18: Origin and Cause
Upon hearing Klein’s question, Dunn looked out of the window
toward the corridor that led to Chanis Gate. He took out his pipe,
stuﬀed it with some tobacco and mint leaves, and held it to his nose.
He took a deep whiﬀ as his voice turned reﬂective and drifting.
“Only at home can I enjoy the beautiful ﬂavors of tobacco mixed with
mint leaves without any worries… Klein, do you know about the
creation myth?”
“Of course, when I received primary education during Sunday school,
we learned to read using The Revelation of Evernight. Among them,
the Book of Wisdom and the Letters from the Saints mentioned the
myth of creation.” Klein attempted to recall via the memory
fragments of the original Klein. He slowed down his tempo and said,
“The Creator awoke from Chaos and shattered the darkness, creating
the ﬁrst ray of light. He then fused himself completely into the
universe and made up all of existence. His body became the land and
stars. One of his eyes became the sun, while the other became the
crimson moon. Some of his blood rushed into the seas and rivers,
nourishing and nurturing lives…”
Klein subconsciously paused when he said that. Partially, it was
because the relevant memories were a blur and that the creation
myth was very similar to the Chinese creation myth of Pangu.
The imaginations of people from diﬀerent worlds shared something
in common on their myths and legends!
Noticing that Klein was having ‘trouble,’ Dunn smiled and added,
“His lungs turned into the elves; His heart turned into the giants; His
liver turned into the treants; His brain turned into the dragons; His
kidneys turned into the feather serpents; His hair turned into the
phoenixes; His ears turned into the demonic wolves; His mouth and
teeth turned into the mutants, and His remaining bodily ﬂuids turned
into the sea monsters, of which the essence was Naga. His stomach,
His small and large intestines, and the evil parts of His body turned
into devils, evil spirits and various kinds of unknown maleﬁcent
existences. His spirit became the Eternal Blazing Sun, the Lord of the
Storms, and the God of Knowledge and Wisdom…”
“His wisdom gave birth to humanity. That was the ﬁrst Epoch, the
Chaos Epoch.” Klein ﬁnished the last sentence for Dunn, but he found
it funny and ridiculous.
As a keyboard folklorist, it was the ﬁrst time he came into contact
with a creation myth that was ‘arranged’ in such great detail. It was
so detailed that almost every prominent race corresponded to a
particular body part of the Creator.
It’s like a children’s song with children sitting in a row and eating
fruit…
Furthermore, it was not only mentioned in the canon of the Evernight
Goddess. The Churches of the Lord of Storms and God of Steam and
Machinery also had similar descriptions. None of them alleviated
themselves or devalued the other gods…
This either means that the creation myth is real or hints that the few
Churches had undergone a long period of strife before compromising
before the Fifth Epoch…
With this in mind, Klein suddenly had another question. He asked
with a frown, “It feels problematic. Why are the Eternal Blazing Sun,
Lord of Storms, and God of Knowledge and Wisdom born directly
from the Creator’s spirit, while the Goddess isn’t?”
In the Revelation of Evernight’s prehistorical records, the Evernight
Goddess had only awoken at the end of the Second Epoch. Together
with the Lord of Storms, Eternal Blazing Sun, and other gods, she
blessed and help humanity survive the Cataclysm. It was also known
as the Third Epoch, the Cataclysm Epoch.
It was during that time that Mother Earth and the God of War
appeared as well. As for the God of Steam and Machinery, whose
original name was the God of Craftsmanship, He was born only in the
Fourth Epoch.
In that sense, the standing among the gods seemed self-evident.
The ones who were more ancient was more orthodox. It was
extremely clear!
This also troubled the believers of the Evernight Goddess.
Dunn Smith held his pipe with another hand and instead of
answering, he returned with a question, “Repeat the Goddess’s full
title.”
Klein immediately felt like he had stabbed himself with a knife. He
racked his brains and tried his best to recall.
“The Evernight Goddess is nobler than the stars and more eternal
than eternity. She is also the Lady of Crimson, the Mother of the
Secrets, the Empress of Disaster and Horror, Mistress of Calm and
Silence.”
Thankfully, Klein’s mother was a devout believer of the Evernight
Goddess. When she was still alive, she would recite this every
evening at dinner. Even though the memories of the original Klein
had fragmented, not all was lost.
“What does the Lady of Crimson symbolize?” Dunn asked with a
guiding tone.
“The red moon.” The moment Klein answered, he immediately
understood.
“Then which part of the Creator did the red moon come from?” asked
Dunn with a smile.
“A single eye!” Klein and Dunn smiled at each other.
This was no way less impressive than the Lord of Storms who was
formed from a third of the Creator’s spirit!
As for the Churches of Mother Earth and the God of War, they likely
had similar explanations. However, the God of Steam and Machinery
had been born too late to ﬁnd a reason; thus, their church had been
weak in the past thousand plus years. It was only with the invention
of the steam engine that they seized the opportunity to truly be on
par with the other gods.
Dunn stroked his pipe gently.
“Humanity was born out of the wisdom of the Creator, so we have
clever and extraordinary brains, but lack other magical powers.
However, from the creation myth, we can form a simple but clear
conclusion. Everything stems from the same origin.”
“Stems from the same origin…” Klein repeated the last few words.
“According to this conclusion, humans who are protected by the gods
were able to resist the giants, devils, and the mutants. Gradually,
they ﬁgured out means to obtain the power of the Beyonders. That is
by using the corresponding parts of the evil spirits, dragons,
monsters, magical trees, ﬂowers, or crystals and combining them
with other materials to form potions. By consuming and absorbing
the potion, one will gain diﬀerent powers. This is common
knowledge among mysticism studies.”
Dunn did not elaborate in detail and only gave a brief introduction.
“In this process, our ancestors relied on painful lessons to discover
that if they were to consume high-grade or extraordinary potions, it
would easily lead to tragic consequences. There are three possible
outcomes.”
“Which three?” pressed Klein curiously.
“First, mental death and the complete breakdown of a body. Every
piece of ﬂesh would become a terrifying monster. Second, their
personality will be changed by the powers contained in the potion.
They will turn cold, sensitive, irascible, cruel, and indiﬀerent. Third,
well…” Dunn put down his pipe and picked up a porcelain cup and
took a sip. “Fermo coﬀee from the Paz River Valley is bitter, but very
fragrant. It leaves a splendid aftertaste. Do you want one?”
“I prefer coﬀee from the Feynapotter plateau. Of course, I have only
drank it a few times at Welch’s place.” Klein politely declined.
“What’s the third outcome?”
“Mental disorder. Turning crazy on the spot, becoming more devilish
than the devil. This is what it means by losing control.” Dunn
emphasized the words ‘losing control.’
Without waiting for Klein to say a word, he put down his coﬀee cup
and continued, “After a long period of experimentation and
exploration, together with the birth of the Blasphemy Slate, humans
have ﬁnally perfected the potion system. We formed a tiered system
that chains into stable progression paths known as Sequences. The
lower the number in a Sequence, the higher the grade of a potion. At
this point, the seven major churches each control at least one
complete Sequence. Besides, there are also incomplete ‘paths’ that
they have gathered over the past hundreds or thousand years.”
“Blasphemy Slate?” Klein sharply noticed the term.
At the Gathering, The Hanged Man had also mentioned it!
According to The Hanged Man, the Blasphemy Slate was the most
critical factor of a potion’s system formation and completion!
That seemed to contradict what Dunn had just said.
“Those were things created by some evil gods. As for which era it
appeared, what it contains or what’s so special about it, I am unsure
as well. If you discover any clues, you have to immediately report it
to me. It deserves the highest level of response,” said Dunn vaguely.
“I mentioned one of the types of losing control. I’ll now tell you the
remaining four.”
“Alright.” Klein pushed the question of the Blasphemy Slate to the
back of his mind and listened attentively.
“Although humans have clever minds, they lack extraordinary
powers, it is not absolute. There are always a few lucky ones; perhaps
I should call them the unlucky ones. They are born with relatively
higher perception. Well, it also means the ability to sense spirits.
They can hear voices that others cannot hear and see things that
others cannot see. They have partial characteristics of Beyonders.”
While Dunn spoke, he looked at the empty air around him and
watched Klein shudder in fear. “In other words, if they are half a
Sequence 9 Beyonder and have ﬁxed characteristics. Oh, Sequence 9
is the lowest grade in the ‘chain…’ In short, they can only choose a
corresponding, ﬁxed Sequence pathway. If they consume other
potions, the eﬀects might range from mental disorders to a loss of
control, or even worse, death.”
“Got it.” Klein nodded slowly.
“The third kind is similar to the second kind. Once you choose a
Sequence chain, you will be forced to go down that path. There will
be no room for regret. If you were to consume potions from the
corresponding Sequence of other ‘paths,’ there will be a high
probability you will get mixed, unusual and warped powers. But it is
almost certain that you would be in a semi-deranged state; sensitive
and irascible, cruel and bloodthirsty, and silent and melancholic.
“And there is only one such opportunity. After that, regardless if you
consume the potions from the original path or potions in the present
Sequence, the only result is a loss of control. The outcome could then
be mental death; alternatively, the body breaks down into monsters
or even transforms into an evil spirit.” As Dunn spoke, he lifted his
coﬀee cup to take a sip.
Klein, who turned alarmed and fearful after hearing this, fell silent
for a few seconds before asking, “What about the fourth kind?”
“The fourth kind, heh heh. That is the most common problem. When
we consume potions to gain powers that originally belong to
extraordinary beings, we undergo an unnatural transformation.
Therefore, we would more or less be aﬀected by the remnant spiritual
powers. While perhaps the symptoms might not manifest and are
undetectable to others, it will deﬁnitely lurk in one’s mind. If one
rushes to consume the corresponding potion ranked higher in the
Sequence before fully grasping the extraordinary powers the potion
brings and eliminating the subtle traces, the madness will
accumulate, increasing the chances of losing control…” Dunn
suddenly fell silent.
After a short pause, he said with a sigh, “As per the internal rules of
us Nighthawks, even if a teammate were to make a great
contribution, they must have consumed the last potion three years
ago and be examined before they can be promoted. Even so, there are
still many who lose control every year.”
How terrifying… Klein drew a gasp as he asked, “Then what about
the ﬁnal kind?”
There was no trace of a smile despite Dunn’s curved lips.
“The ﬁfth kind is the most common reason for a loss of control. For
Beyonders, one’s spiritual perception would be enhanced more or
less. The smaller the number in the Sequence, the more enhanced
their perception. Therefore, they would hear what others cannot
hear, see what others cannot see, and encounter things others would
not encounter. They are constantly met with mysterious enticement
and illusionary bewitchment. Once they are overstimulated or have
greedy desires, they will slowly go down the path of losing control.”
As he spoke, Dunn looked straight at Klein, his gray pupils reﬂecting
Klein’s ﬁgure.
His tone turned bleak as he said, “The founder of the Nighthawks,
Archbishop Chanis, once said, ‘We are guardians, but also a bunch of
miserable wretches that are constantly ﬁghting against dangers and
madness.'”
Chapter 19: Sealed Artifacts
“We are guardians, but also a bunch of miserable wretches that are
constantly ﬁghting against dangers and madness.”
The corridor outside the window was sealed, its walls ice-cold. The
room was illuminated with bright yellow lights. Dunn Smith’s
delivery echoed, sending blow after blow to Klein’s heart. It left him
temporarily at a loss for words.
Dunn shook his head and smiled when he saw Klein silent.
“Are you very disappointed? Beyonders are not like what you
imagine them to be. We are always treading alongside danger.”
“There is always a price to any gain.” Klein recovered from his shock
as he answered with a quivering voice.
It was true that he never imagined that the halo, extraordinariness,
and the inordinary aspects of a Beyonder would have such hidden
threats. Perhaps it was only because he was hearing a description
without witnessing it ﬁrst hand and that he had been sucked into the
vortex with a peculiar incident already befalling him. Klein soon
brought his fear, uneasiness, worry, and apprehension under control.
Of course, the thought of shrinking back was inevitable; it lingered
around and refused to leave.
“Not bad. Very mature and rational…” Dunn ﬁnished the last
mouthful of coﬀee and added, “Also, Beyonders are not as powerful
as you imagine them to be, especially a low-Sequence Beyonder. Heh,
why would we use 1 to represent the highest grade and 9 the lowest?
Isn’t this against intuition and logic? The low Sequence we often
mention refers to a low grade or a high number. They are the starting
point of the Sequence chain.
“Alright, where was I? Yes, Beyonders are not as powerful as you
imagine. A low-Sequence Beyonder’s power is no match for guns,
much less cannons. They are just more fascinating and indefensible
than ﬁrearms. If you have a chance to become a Beyonder in the
future, you must consider what I said today carefully. Do not make a
rash decision.”
Klein gave a self-deprecating smile.
“I don’t even know when I will have the chance.”
He felt that he would not miss the opportunity if it presented itself to
him. Consuming the wrong potion or a higher-ranked potion in the
Sequence could be mostly avoid. The major potential danger was the
subtle inﬂuences the potions had and what he experienced from
having heightened auditory and visual perceptions.
For the former, he could draw on the experiences from generations of
people before him. As long as he was not in a rush to advance himself
and patiently grasped control over his powers, the chances of losing
control were relatively low. Furthermore, he still had to resolve the
potential problem that he currently faced. He had to understand the
essence of mysticism and seek a way to transmigrate back. These
were the underlying reasons for taking the ﬁrst step. He did not aim
for higher Sequence spots. If it was easy to lose control, he could just
forget about advancement, stay in his original Sequence, and rely on
knowledge to plan a way ‘home.’
It was needless to elaborate on the potential risks. Back when Klein
held the luck enhancement ritual, he was nearly driven crazy. The
murmurings that nearly blew up his head were still fresh in his mind.
They were not unavoidable by not becoming a Beyonder; therefore, it
was better to gain power that allowed him to defend himself.
With this in mind, Klein felt that the pros clearly outweighed the
cons. It made his thoughts of withdrawal almost disappear.
Dunn picked up his pipe again as his gray eyes carried a smiling trace
to them.
“I cannot give you an accurate answer on this. To become a
Beyonder, ﬁrstly, you must make enough contributions. Perhaps
tomorrow or the day after, you would be able to interpret critical
ancient documents. Maybe you would be able to give us valuable
ideas for one of our cases? Secondly, it depends on the arrangements
of the higher-ups. No one can be sure.
“Alright, I believe you should know quite a bit about Beyonders now.
In the future, do not make a rash decision. Now, I’ll introduce you to
our Nighthawk team’s civilian jobs.”
He stood up and walked to the door. He pointed in the opposite
direction of Chanis Gate and said, “We have an accountant and
someone else who is in charge of procuring necessities and collecting
supplies handed out by the Church and the police department while
standing in as a carriage driver. They are professionals and do not
need to take shifts, so they can rest on weekends. The other three
civilian staﬀ are Rozanne, Bredt, and Old Neil. Their jobs include:
attending to visitors, cleaning the rooms, and writing case ﬁles and
inventory registration lists. They also guard the armory, storeroom,
and the archives, strictly enforcing the registration should someone
wish to enter, take out or return an item. Each of them has one day
oﬀ a week, other than Sundays. They negotiate among themselves on
the arrangement of night shifts and rest days.”
“So is my job scope the same as Rozanne and the rest?” Klein swept
away his thoughts about Beyonders and tried to clarify his job
responsibilities.
“No, there’s no need. You are a professional,” said Dunn with a smile.
“You currently have two tasks. First, every morning or afternoon, go
take a stroll outside. Focus on the various streets that lead from
Welch’s place to yours.”
“What?” Klein was dumbfounded.
What kind of job is this?
Is that very professional?
Dunn inserted his hands into the pockets of his black windbreaker
and said, “After you conﬁrm that you have lost your memories, we
will close the case on Welch and Naya. Similarly, that diary of the
Antigonus family has vanished completely. We suspect that you
brought it with you. You might have hidden it on your way home
which might be why we did not ﬁnd any clues at your place. This is
also likely the reason why you were not there and chose to commit
suicide at home.
“Although you were mysteriously inﬂuenced and have forgotten this
piece of memory, the human spirit and brain is very fascinating, so
there might be residual traces. Daly might not be able to obtain them
through her means as a medium, but it does not mean that they do
not exist. Perhaps you will feel a sense of déjà vu at a familiar and
critical spot.
“That is what we wish to obtain.”
“Got it.” Klein was enlightened.
The Nighthawks’ deduction of the diary’s location was indeed
reasonable.
He was the only one alive among the people involved. Only he had
the time and motive to take the diary away and hide it on his way
back!
“If you can ﬁnd the diary this way, you will likely made enough of a
contribution to become a Beyonder,” encouraged Dunn, indirectly
revealing the importance of the diary.
“I hope.” Klein nodded.
Dunn changed the subject again.
“Secondly, you get a day oﬀ every week. You can decide which day it
is for now. When you are not outside, go to our armory and read the
literature and canon books. This is a job for a professional historian.
When you ﬁnish them all, you will have to begin taking shifts with
Old Neil and the rest.”
“Alright, no problem.” Klein heaved a sigh of relief.
This is not something too diﬃcult…
At this moment, Dunn turned his body halfway and pointed to the
black outward-swinging gates that was engraved with seven sacred
emblems.
“This is Chanis Gate. It is named after the creator of the modern
Nighthawk system, Archbishop Chanis. There is one under the central
cathedral of every major city.
“It is guarded by formal Nighthawk members on rotation. Inside,
there are at least two ‘Keepers’ who are sent by the Church, as well as
countless traps. You must not approach it under any circumstance;
otherwise, misfortune will befall you.”
“That sounds scary,” Klein expressed his feelings.
“The area inside is divided into a few zones. Stored within are certain
potion formulas for certain Sequences and other magical materials. It
is also used to temporarily hold heretics, mutants, cultists, and
members of secret organizations. Heh heh, they will eventually be
sent to the Holy Cathedral,” introduced Dunn in passing.
Holy Cathedral? The headquarters of the Church of the Evernight Goddess
located in the Winter County to the north of the kingdom, Cathedral of
Serenity? Klein nodded slightly as though he was pondering over the
matter.
“In addition, there are all sorts of classiﬁed documents and records
inside. When you gain a higher clearance, you might have a chance
of reading them.” Dunn hesitated for a moment before adding,
“Behind the Chanis Gate, there are also Sealed Artifacts in the
basement.”
“Sealed Artifacts?” Klein ruminated on the terms.
It sounded like a specialized term.
“Some of the extraordinary items we gather and retrieve are just too
important and magical. If they fall into the wrong hands, it would
cause immense destruction. Therefore, we have to keep it strictly
conﬁdential and watch them carefully. Even we can only use it under
special circumstances. Besides…” With that said, Dunn paused for a
moment before continuing, “Besides, there are some things inside
that are very special. They had certain ‘living’ characteristics which
can entice the Keepers. It would inﬂuence the surroundings, attempt
escape, and cause catastrophic outcomes. They have to be strictly
controlled.”
“How fascinating,” commented Klein wistfully.
“The Nighthawk headquarters have categorized these Sealed Artifacts
into four grades. Grade 0 represents Extremely Dangerous. They are
of the highest importance and of the highest conﬁdentiality. They are
not to be inquired, disseminated, described, or spied. They can only
be sealed in the basement of the Holy Cathedral,” described Dunn in
detail. “Grade 1 is Highly Dangerous. They can be used in limited
ways. Their security clearance is limited to diocesan bishops or
Nighthawk deacons and above. The central cathedral of diocese
headquarters like Backlund can store one to two artifacts. The rest
will be handed over to the Holy Cathedral.
“Grade 2 is Dangerous. They can be used with care and moderation.
The security clearance requires one to be a bishop or a Nighthawk
team’s captain and above. The central cathedrals in the various cities
can store three to ﬁve artifacts. The rest will be turned into the Holy
Cathedral or the diocese headquarters. Grade 3 is Considerably
Dangerous. They have to be used carefully. It can only be applied for
operations that require three or more people. The security clearance
requires one to be a formal member of the Nighthawks.”
“In the future, you will see the corresponding documents. Through
the numbers, you can understand what they represent. For instance,
2-125 means that it is a Dangerous grade Sealed Artifact No. 125.”
As Dunn went on, he suddenly turned around and returned to his
room. He pulled out a piece of paper from the bottom of the drawer.
“By the way, take a look at this. Three years ago, a newly appointed
archbishop lost control. For some unknown reason, he stormed
through the various levels of protection and vanished mysteriously
with a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact. Memorize this photo. If you discover
him, do not alert or disturb him. Return to report it immediately or
the chance of you dying in the line of duty is a thousand percent.”
“What?” Klein received the piece of paper. There was no title on it,
just a black and white photo with a few lines of words.
“Ince Zangwill. Male. Forty years old. Former archbishop. A
Gatekeeper who failed in his promotion and was enticed by the devil
and was corrupted. He escaped with Sealed Artifact 0-08. Particular
traits are…”
The picture depicted Ince Zangwill as wearing an all-black clergyman
robe with buttons on both sides and a soft cap. His hair was dark
blonde and his pupils were so blue that it was nearly black. He had a
high nose and his lips were tightly pursed. His facial features were
like a classic sculpture without any wrinkles. The most striking
characteristic was that he was blind in one eye.
“The description of the corrupted is so detailed but the only thing
about the Sealed Artifact is its codename…” Klein honestly oﬀered
his ﬁrst impression.
“That’s why it is at the highest security clearance. The search for
Sealed Artifacts No. 0-08 is only described verbally and never written
in words. Even so, the description will be little,” said Dunn with a
sigh. “0-08 appears to be a common quill, but it does not need ink to
write. That’s all.”
Dunn did not dive deeper into the topic. He tugged at the golden
chain on his black windbreaker and took out a gorgeous pocket
watch of the same color. He clicked it open and took a glance before
pointing outside.
“I’ve told you all you need to know. Go to the armory to ﬁnd Old
Neil. Get him to arrange the documents that you need to read. He is
no ordinary civilian clerk. He was once a formal member, but due to
his advanced age, he failed to be promoted. His health is ailing, so
it’s no longer suitable for him to handle cases. Furthermore, he does
not wish to become an internal Keeper or rest at home. All he wishes
is to be accompanied by documents and records.”
Chapter 20: The Forgetful Dunn
“Okay.” Klein bowed slightly as he wore his short top hat again.
However, his mind was preoccupied with how Sealed Artifact 0-08
looked.
It appears to be just your everyday quill?
It writes without ink?
Then, what is its actual use? What makes it classiﬁed at the highest
level of conﬁdentiality that it’s deemed Extremely Dangerous?
Can it be a pen that kills anyone whose name is written?
No, that would be way too heaven-defying. Ince Zangwill wouldn’t
need to escape and hide away if that were the case…
Just as Klein turned around to leave, Dunn suddenly shouted out to
him.
“Hold on. I forgot something.”
“What?” Klein turned his head; his eyes puzzled.
Dunn put back his pocket watch and said with a smile, “Later,
remember to visit the accountant, Mrs. Orianna, and get an advance
payment of four weeks—a total of twelve pounds. After that, you’ll
earn half your salary every week until the diﬀerence is covered.”
“That’s too much. There’s no need for this, the amount should be
reduced,” said Klein subconsciously.
He had no objection towards an advanced payment. After all, he
didn’t even have the money needed to pay for the public horse
carriage trip home. However, to receive twelve pounds at once left
him a little afraid.
“No, it’s necessary,” said Dun as he shook his head and smiled.
“Think about it. Do you still wish to continue living in your present
apartment? One that needs you to share a bathroom with so many
other tenants? Even if you aren’t taking yourself into consideration,
think about the lady. Besides…”
He paused when he saw Klein nod in agreement. He smiled and sized
up Klein’s garbs and said with a meaningful intent, “Besides, you
need a cane, and you should buy a new suit.”
Klein was taken aback for a second before snapping back to reality.
His face immediately burned with embarrassment since the suit he
was wearing was cheap and of inferior quality.
Typically, a top hat was made of silk, costing ﬁve to six soli. A bow
tie was three soli, a walking cane inlaid with silver was seven to eight
soli, a shirt was three soli, while pants, a vest, and tuxedo were
around seven pounds in total. Leather boots were nine to ten soli. As
such, an entire suit cost more than eight pounds and seven soli. Of
course, to be a presentable gentleman, one needed a watch chain, a
pocket watch, and a wallet.
Back then, the original Klein and Benson scrimped and saved before
managing to save up a pool of money. When they went to a clothing
store to check the price, they ended up running oﬀ without even
bothering to try haggling. They each bought a set at a bargain shop
near Iron Cross Street for a total of less than two pounds.
It was also because of that incident that original Klein had a deep
impression of the prices of clothes.
“O-Okay,” Klein stammered a reply.
He was like the original Klein. He was someone who cared about his
appearance.
Dunn took out the pocket watch again and clicked it open to take a
glance at it.
“Perhaps you should ﬁnd Mrs. Orianna ﬁrst? I know you’ll spend
quite some time at Old Neil’s while Mrs. Orianna will likely be
returning home soon.”
“Alright.” Klein was acutely aware of his state of poverty and did not
object to it.
Dunn returned to the table’s side and pulled at a few hanging ropes
as he said, “I’ll get Rozanne to bring you there.”
The ropes began their operation as the gears ground, producing a
chime from a bell at the reception area of Blackthorn Security
Company. When Rozanne heard it, she hurriedly stood up and
carefully made her way down.
It did not take long before she appeared in front of Klein again.
Dunn said humorously, “I did not disturb your rest, right? Oh, bring
Moretti to Mrs. Orianna.”
Rozanne secretly curled her lips as she answered ‘happily—’
“Alright, Captain.”
“Is that all?” At that moment, Klein blurted out in surprise.
To get his advance payment from ﬁnance, isn’t there a need to get an
approval letter from the Captain? Shouldn’t you write something?
“So?” Dunn returned with a question.
“I mean— Don’t I need your signature to claim an advance payment
from Mrs. Orianna?” Klein tried his best to use simple language.
“Oh, no. There’s no need. Rozanne is enough proof.” Dunn pointed at
the brown-haired girl and gave a reply.
Captain, it seems there’s almost zero management of our ﬁnances…
Klein resisted his urge to deliver a sarcastic comment before turning
to leave the room with Rozanne.
At that moment, he heard Dunn shout out again.
“Hold on. There’s still another thing.”
Can we ﬁnish it all at once? Klein turned back with a smiling face.
“Yes?”
Dunn pressed at his temple and said, “When you meet Old Neil,
remember to collect ten demon hunting bullets.”
“Me? Demon hunting bullets?” Klein returned in astonishment.
“Welch’s revolver is still with you, right? There’s no need for you to
turn it in.” Dunn inserted a single hand into his pocket and said,
“With the demon hunting bullets, if you were to face with an
paranormal danger, you will be able to protect yourself. Uh, it will
give you some courage at the very least.”
There’s no need for you to add on the ﬁnal sentence… Just as Klein
was vexing over the problem, he answered without any hesitation,
“Alright. I’ll remember to do so!”
“This will require me to write a formal document. Wait a moment.”
Dunn sat down and picked up the dark red fountain pen. He scribbled
a ‘note,’ signed it, and stamped it.
“Thank you, Captain.” Klein received it sincerely.
He slowly walked back before turning around.
“Hold on.”
Dunn shouted one more time.
…Captain, you look to be in your thirties. Why do you have the
symptoms of dementia? Klein squeezed out a smile and turned
around to ask, “Anything else?”
“I forgot earlier that you are not trained in shooting, so getting
demon hunting bullets would be useless. Let’s do this; collect thirty
normal bullets every day. Take the opportunity when you are out to
go to the street corner—the underground shooting range at No. 3
Zouteland Street. Most of it belongs to the police department, but
there is one that is specially for us Nighthawks. Oh, right, you also
need to get a badge from Old Neil. Otherwise, you won’t be able to
enter the shooting range.” Dunn smacked his forehead and took back
the note from Klein. He then added the information and stamped it
with another seal.
“A good marksman is produced by expending bullets. Do not think
lightly of it.” Dunn handed back Klein the modiﬁed note.
“Got it.” Klein, who was fearful of danger, yearned to visit the
shooting range that very day.
He took two steps towards the exit before carefully turning around
halfways. He deliberated before asking, “Captain, is there anything
else?”
“No.” Dunn nodded ﬁrmly.
Klein heaved a sigh of relief and walked straight out the door. While
walking, he had the strong urge to turn around to ask another, “Are
you sure there’s nothing else?”
He resisted that urge and ﬁnally left the Keeper room successfully.
“Captain has always been this way. He often forgets things.” As
Rozanne walked by his side, she softly disparaged the captain, “Even
my granny has a better memory than him. Of course, he only forgets
the trivial stuﬀ. Yea, trivial stuﬀ. Klein, I’ll call you Klein in the
future. Mrs. Orianna is a very aﬀable person. It is easy to hit it oﬀ
with her. Her father is a watchsmith with excellent skill…”
As Klein listened to the brown-haired girl rattle on, he stepped into
the stairwell and returned to the upper ﬂoor. He found Mrs. Orianna
in the far oﬃce on the right-hand side.
She was a black-haired woman dressed in a ﬂounce lace dress. She
appeared in her thirties and had fashionable curly hair. Her pair of
green eyes were clear and smiling, and she seemed reﬁned and
elegant.
After Orianna heard Rozanne repeat Dunn Smith’s instructions, she
took out a note and wrote an advance slip.
“Sign here. Do you have a seal? If not, you can leave a thumbprint.”
“Alright.” Now familiar with the procedures, Klein completed the
formalities.
Orianna took out a copper key and opened the safe in the room. As
she counted the pounds, she said with a smile, “You are lucky. We
have enough cash today. By the way, Klein, were you invited by
Captain because you were involved in a paranormal activity and the
fact that you have a specialty?”
“Yes, you have an impeccable intuition.” Klein was not stingy with
his compliments.
Orianna took out four notes with light-gray backgrounds with deep
black patterns printed on them. After locking the safe, she turned
around and smiled.
“That’s because I had a similar experience too.”
“Really?” Klein showed an appropriate level of surprise.
“Do you know about the serial killer that sent Tingen City into a
frenzy sixteen years ago?” Orianna handed over the four gold pounds
to Klein.
“…Yes! It’s the one which had ﬁve girls killed consecutively. Some
had their hearts and stomachs removed by that Bloody Butcher? My
mother often used that matter to scare my sister when we were
young,” said Klein as he thought about it.
He received the notes and discovered that two of them were in ﬁve
pound denominations and two of them were in one pound
denominations. All of them had a gray background and were inked in
black. The four corners had complicated patterns and special ink to
prevent counterfeiting.
The former notes were slightly bigger and in the middle of them was
Loen Kingdom’s ﬁfth king, George III’s direct ancestor, Henry
Augustus I. He wore a white hair band above his rotund face. His
eyes were slender and he had an abnormally serious expression.
However, Klein felt an indescribably sense of closeness to him.
This was a ﬁve-pound note!
It’s almost equal to four weeks of Benson’s salary!
In the middle of the one-pound note was George III’s father, the
former king, William Augustus VI. This mighty ﬁgure had a thick
mustache and a ﬁrm gaze. While he was in power, he freed the Loen
Kingdom from the shackles of the old order, allowing his nation to
regain the pinnacle spot.
They were all ‘good kings…’ Klein could faintly smell the notes’ ink
that elated and refreshed him.
“Yes, if the Nighthawks had not come in time, I would have been the
sixth victim.” Mrs. Orianna’s tone still hinted at a sense of lingering
fear despite the incident having happened more than ten years ago.
“I heard that the serial killer, no— The Butcher was a Beyonder?”
Klein carefully folded the paper notes and placed it in an inner
pocket of his suit. Then, he patted the area a few times to conﬁrm it
was there.
“Yes.” Mrs. Orianna gave a ﬁrm nod. “He had killed even more
before that. The reason why he was captured was because he was
preparing a ritual for the devil.”
“No wonder he wanted diﬀerent organs… Sorry, Mrs. Orianna for
making you recall such unpleasant memories,” said Klein sincerely.
Orianna smiled. “I’m no longer afraid… I was studying accountancy
in business school back then. After that incident, I’ve been here ever
since. Alright, I’ll stop keeping you from what you should do. You
still need to head to Old Neil’s.”
“Goodbye, Mrs. Orianna.” Klein took oﬀ his hat and bowed before
leaving the oﬃce. Before he went downstairs, he could not help but
pat his inner pocket to make sure the twelve pounds was still there.
He did a turn at a cross-junction and headed right. It did not take him
long to see a half-closed iron door.
Knock! Knock! Knock!
While he knocked, an aged voice sounded from inside.
“Come in.”
Klein pushed open the metal door and discovered a cramped room
which only allowed for a desk and two chairs.
There was a tightly locked iron door inside the room and behind the
desk was a hoary elder dressed in a class black robe. He was reading
a few yellowed pages from a book with the illumination of a gas
lamp.
He raised his head and looked at the door.
“Are you Klein Moretti? Rozanne said you were very polite when she
came over a while ago.”
“Miss Rozanne is really a friendly person. Good afternoon, Mr. Neil.”
Klein took oﬀ his hat as a gesture of respect.
“Have a seat.” Neil pointed to the silver tin can with complex ﬂowery
patterns on the table. “Would you like a cup of handground coﬀee?”
The wrinkles at the edge of his eyes and mouth were deeply recessed.
His dark red pupils appeared slightly turbid.
“It doesn’t seem like you drink coﬀee?” Klein acutely noticed that
Neil’s porcelain cup was ﬁlled with clear water.
“Haha, it’s a habit of mine. I do not drink coﬀee after three in the
afternoon,” Neil explained with a laugh.
“Why?” Klein asked in passing.
Neil held back his smile as he looked into Klein’s eyes and said, “I’m
afraid that it would aﬀect my sleep at night. It will make me hear the
murmurings of the unknown existence.”
Klein was momentarily unable to answer him as he changed the
subject.
“Mr. Neil, what documents and books should I read?”
As he spoke, he took out the note written by Dunn.
“Anything that has to do with history, or are complicated and
incomplete. To be honest, I have always been trying to learn, but all I
can achieve is a rudimentary grasp. It’s just too troublesome for the
other material, such as people’s diaries, contemporary books,
epitaphs, etc…” lamented Neil. “For example, the things I have here
require more detailed historical records to determine the exact
content.”
“Why?” Klein turned confused.
Neil pointed to a few yellowed pages in front of him.
“These are from Roselle Gustav’s lost diary before his death. In order
to keep things secret, he used strange symbols he invented to take
records.”
Emperor Roselle? The transmigration senior? Klein was taken aback
as he immediately listened attentively.
“Many people believe that he did not truly die, but instead became a
hidden god. Therefore, cults which revere him have always been
holding various rituals to attempt at gaining power. We will
occasionally encounter such incidents and obtain a few original or
duplicated copies of the diary,” Neil said with a shake of his head.
“Till date, no one has been able to decipher the special symbols’ true
meaning. Therefore, the Holy Cathedral has permitted us to keep
copies for research, hoping that it would bring them a pleasant
surprise.”
With that said, Neil revealed a smug smile.
“I have already deciphered a few symbols and have conﬁrmed that
they represent numbers. Look at what I discovered. It’s actually a
diary! Yes, I wish to use history from diﬀerent periods, especially
events that revolved around the emperor. By comparing those records
to the ones written in the diary for the corresponding day, I can try to
interpret more of the symbols.
“That’s the mind of a genius, right?” The old gentleman with white
hair and deep wrinkles looked at Klein with bright eyes.
Klein nodded in agreement.
“Yes.”
“Haha, you can also take a look at it. Tomorrow, you will have to
help me with this diary.” Neil pushed the few yellowed pages
towards Klein.
Klein turned them around and took a glance at them, but it
immediately stunned him!
Although the ‘symbols’ had been copied in terribly ugly fashion, to
the point of looking a little distorted, there was no way he could be
mistaken…
This was because they were words he was most familiar with.
Chinese!
And it’s f**king Simpliﬁed Chinese!
Chapter 21: An Old Friend In A
Diﬀerent World
In that instant, Klein even believed that he had transmigrated back.
However, the elegant gas lamp surrounded by brass grids and the
silver-inlaid tin, which Old Neil kept his handground coﬀee in, made
him recognize the reality he was in.
The transmigrator, Emperor Roselle, is really a fellow countryman of
mine? He was using Simpliﬁed Chinese—which doesn’t exist in this world
—to record secrets? With the indescribable feeling of identifying an
old friend in a diﬀerent world, Klein quickly read through the three
pages.
“18th November. Truly a fascinating matter. A blue-sky
experimentation and a chance mistake made me discover the pathetic
fellow lost and trapped in the deep darkness amid the storms. He can
only approach the reality of this world on the day of the full moon
every month; yet, he is unable to transmit his cries. He is lucky to
have met me, the protagonist of this era.”
“After reading the paragraph I wrote above, I suddenly felt a little
down. Even my Chinese is written like a translation. Four decades
have passed in a ﬁnger snap. My past memories feel more like a
dream.”
“1184, 1st January. At the grand New Year Gala, Lady Florena was
truly splendid.”
“2nd January. My diplomats are all idiots!”
“3rd January. I made a hasty choice back then. In hindsight, I should
have chosen the Apprentice, the Seer, or the Bandit. Unfortunately,
there is no way of redoing it.”
“4th January. Why are my children so stupid? I’ve repeated myself so
many times. Do not be fooled by those charlatans! The key thing
about potions is not about grasping them, but digesting them! It’s
nothing about tapping powers, but acting! And the name of a potion
is not solely symbolic at its core, but a concrete imagery, and the
‘key’ to digestion!”
“9th September. An alliance opposing me has been established.
Feysac from the north, Loen from the east, Feynapotter from the
south. My enemies have ﬁnally joined forces, but I have no fear. I
will use facts to teach them that the generations of weapons and
knowledge cannot be compensated by mere numbers and low-grade
Sequencers. Besides, it’s not as though I do not have subordinates. As
for the higher-grades, heh heh. Have they forgotten who I am?”
“23rd September. I have lost communications with the ship seeking
the Forsaken Land of the Gods. I should consider inventing wireless
telegraphs. I hope it would not be aﬀected by the storm.”
“24th September. Miss Ithaca is more mesmerizing than Lady
Florena. Perhaps, I’m just being nostalgic about my youth.”
Due to the complexity of characters in Simpliﬁed Chinese, the font
was slightly larger than normal, leading to less content on each page.
Furthermore, for preservational and research purposes, the back of
each page was left empty. But even so, Klein still felt an upheaval of
emotions when he read the diary. In particular, Emperor Roselle’s
description of the crux of potions made him feel like he found the
path to the solution. He was thrilled at having learned a priceless
secret.
Perhaps, this will be a beacon for my future path as a Beyonder! Well, the
three pages belong to entries at diﬀerent times. It seems Emperor Roselle
only writes the year on the ﬁrst entry of each year. It cannot be
determined which year the two pages with September and November
belong to… Who is the pathetic fellow he discovered?
What do “digesting” and “acting” actually mean?
Where is the Forsaken Land of the Gods? …
These questions bubbled in Klein’s head. It made him eager to
immediately gather all of Emperor Roselle’s diary and read it from
cover to cover!
“Klein?” At that moment, Old Neil asked puzzledly across him.
Klein jolted awake as he hurriedly covered it up with a laugh. “I
thought I would be the most special one. I was trying to decipher and
interpret it.”
“You are young indeed.” Old Neil nodded, laughing. “I once believed
that I was the most special one as well.”
Klein ﬂipped through the three pages in his hand and after
conﬁrming that he had not missed anything, he handed it over to Old
Neil and thoughtlessly asked, “Do we only have these few pages?”
I want to see more of Emperor Roselle’s diary! “Did you think there
would be many?” Old Neil caressed the scripts as his wrinkles
deepened from his scoﬀ. “There are not many incidents a year that
involve Beyonders and mystery to begin with. Sigh, the major reason
is the gradual extinction of extraordinary species in our Northern
Continent. Without them, there won’t be a lot of potions, causing the
number of Beyonders to reduce with time. Sigh, over the past few
centuries, dragons, giants, and elves have become simply records in
books. Even the seafolks are no longer seen near the coastal waters.”
Upon hearing this, Klein suddenly thought of a meme. He
immediately said with a smile, “I think it’s time to establish a
Dragons and Giants Protection Association.”
Old Neil looked confused when he heard that. It took him quite some
time to ﬁgure out what it meant. After ﬁguring out its meaning, he
rapped the table and laughed quite heartily in a not-so-gentlemanly
manner.
“Haha, Klein, you really are humorous. This is a tradition of our Loen
Kingdom. It’s good that young people have a sense of humor. I
believe we shouldn’t be overly narrow in scope. Why are we only
protecting dragons and giants? It should be called Fantastic Beasts
Protection Association.”
“No, no, no. How can we forget those poor plants?” Klein shook his
head.
They exchanged looks and proclaimed in unison: “Fantastic
Organisms Protection Association!”
Both of them laughed tacitly. The awkwardness and unfamiliarity of
the atmosphere between them dissipated considerably.
“There are fewer interesting young people like you these days…
Where was I?” Old Neil’s wrinkles suﬀused a smile as he said, “I
remember. There are not many incidents a year that involve
Beyonders and mystery to begin with. The retards who revere
Emperor Roselle are the minority of the minority. It’s already pretty
good that we can obtain three scripts… Well, the other larger
cathedrals or dioceses might have some…”
After muttering a few words, he took the approval note which Klein
had placed on the table earlier and took a look.
“Are they pistol bullets, riﬂe bullets, or steam-pressured bullets?”
“It’s a revolver,” answered Klein honestly.
“Alright. I’ll go get them. Ahem, do you have an armpit holster? As a
gentleman, we can’t let you have something bulging below your
waist in public.” Old Neil made a joke that all men understood.
“Heh, no. Do I need to get Captain to include it?” Klein smiled
cooperatively.
Old Neil stood up and said, “There’s no need. I just need to make a
record. It’s an accessory item. Repeat after me: accessory item.”
“Were you a teacher in the past?” joked Klein.
“I spent some time at the Church’s Sunday school and free schools.”
Old Neil waved the note and took out a key from the drawer. He then
opened the iron door that led into an inner chamber.
Beyonders do not seem much diﬀerent from commoners… Klein
murmured silently before casting his gaze on the table where the
three pages of the diary were.
Emperor Roselle is indeed involved in the realm of mystery…
His diary is invaluable… To others, they are just pieces of scrap paper. It
is unknown when they will be deciphered, but they are a valuable treasure
to me! I wonder where the remaining parts of the diary are…
I have to think of ways to get more… Klein’s mind went through
upheavals as he could hardly calm down. This continued until Old
Neil came out and closed the iron door.
“Ten demon hunting bullets, thirty revolver bullets. An ox-hide
armpit holster, and a Seventh Unit, Special Operations Department
badge. Please count them and give them a try. Remember to sign the
log book.” Old Neil placed the items down on the table.
The revolver bullets were arranged neatly in a paper box which was
divided into three layers. The bullets shimmered with a yellow sheen
just like the bullets back home, but they appeared narrower.
As for the demon hunting bullets, they were kept in a small iron box.
The shape was identical to regular revolver bullets, but their surface
was silver in color. Upon a more careful examination, there were
complicated and dazzling patterns with tiny Sacred Emblems—a
black background dotted with stars and a half crimson moon—
engraved at the bottom.
The ox-hide holster felt solid and it came with a belt and buckle.
Beside it was a badge half the size of a palm. It had a metallic
background with “Awwa County Police Department and Seventh
Unit, Special Operations Department” inscribed in silver text. They
formed almost two sealed circles and surrounded the “two crossed
swords and a crown” police emblem.
“Unfortunately, it’s not a Nighthawks badge,” Klein said half wistfully
and half probingly.
Old Neil smiled and urged Klein to test the armpit holster.
After he took oﬀ his jacket, Klein took quite a bit of eﬀort to buckle
up the holster, which hung close to his left armpit.
“Not bad.” He put on his jacket again.
Old Neil sized him up and nodded in satisfaction.
“It suits you well. My judgment is as accurate as usual.”
After putting away the other items into his pockets and signing the
log book, Klein had a short, casual conversation with Old Neil before
leaving.
Halfway, he suddenly he slapped himself in the forehead.
“I forgot to learn more about the Sequences and potions. It’s all the
fault of Emperor Roselle’s diary…”
At this point, he was still unaware of what the ﬁrst Sequence of the
complete pathway the Church of the Evernight Goddess possessed.
All he knew was that it started with Sequence 9.
Rozanne had apparently mentioned something… The Sleepless? Just as
Klein was slowly walking towards the stairs, a person came down.
He wore tight trousers which made movement easy. His white shirt
was not tucked in, and he had a clear romantic temperament of a
poet. He was none other than the black-haired, green-eyed police
inspector who had previously came to search Klein’s place. They had
met upstairs previously, but they had not exchanged words.
“Good afternoon,” greeted the young poet-like Nighthawk with a
smile.
“Good afternoon. I believe I do not need to introduce myself?”
answered Klein humorously.
“There’s no need. I have a deep impression of you.” The young
Nighthawk extended his right hand and said, “Leonard Mitchell.
Sequence 8’s Midnight Poet.”
Sequence 8… He’s really a poet… Klein smilingly shook his hand as he
returned with a question, “You have a deep impression of me?”
Leonard Mitchell’s green eyes were deep as he replied with a very
faint smile. “You have a special disposition.”
He feels and sounds so gay… The corners of Klein’s mouth moved
slightly as he barely said with a smile, “I don’t think so myself.”
“After encountering an accident like that, you remained alive despite
not receiving our protection immediately. That makes you special
enough.” Leonard pointed ahead. “I have to replace Captain. See you
tomorrow.”
“See you tomorrow.” Klein turned to make way for the Nighthawk.
As he walked to the ends of the stairwell, Leonard Mitchell suddenly
turned around and stared at the stone-paved ground which was
illuminated by the yellow sunset. He muttered into the air softly,
“Did you manage to notice anything…”
…
“Indeed, there’s nothing special about him…”
Chapter 22: Starting Sequence
After he went up the stairs and returned to the reception hall, Klein
was about to bid Rozanne farewell when he heard the brown-haired
girl mention briskly, “Captain says that you can come on Monday. He
wants you to settle your household aﬀairs ﬁrst.”
“…Alright.” Klein never expected the Nighthawks’ management to be
so humane and accommodating. It made him feel a little grateful.
He was planning on waking early the next morning and make use of
the opportunity to “wander around” to visit Tingen University. He
planned on informing the staﬀ in charge of the interview that he was
not participating in the follow-up interviews. After all, he had
originally obtained the opportunity to make the interview because of
his professor’s recommendation letter. Regardless, it was basic
courtesy to have formal closure. Even if it was not for himself, he had
to respect his mentor’s eﬀorts.
And in a world without telephones, where telegrams were charged by
the character, and the fact that it would be too late to send a letter,
he felt that taking the public carriage to the university was the most
economical and suitable solution.
Having received the Captain’s special approval, Klein did not need to
tire himself out. He could wake up late and still make his way there
on time.
Klein was just about to take oﬀ his hat to bid Rozanne farewell when
he suddenly thought of something. He looked around and suppressed
his voice. “Rozanne, do you know what the starting point of the
Church’s complete Sequence is?”
He had forgotten to ask Old Neil.
Rozanne’s eyes widened as she looked at Klein in astonishment. “You
wish to become a Beyonder?”
Was I that obvious? Klein’s body language betrayed him as he
answered in embarrassment, “Having learned that extraordinary and
mysterious powers exist in the world, it’s inevitable that I have some
yearnings for it.”
“Oh my Goddess. Do you know how dangerous it is? Didn’t Captain
tell you? The enemies of Beyonders are not just cultists or dark
warlocks, but themselves! People lose control nearly every year.
Some even end up sacriﬁcing themselves! Aren’t you going to
consider how your family will feel?” Rozanne’s hand gestures
ampliﬁed her tone as her reaction appeared overly agitated. “Klein, I
think the better choice is to be a civilian staﬀ. There’s nearly no
danger, and our salary increases every year. After a few years of
work, you will have saved up much money, allowing you to rent a
bungalow in the North Borough or in the suburbs. You can then
marry a rich and charming lady and have a wonderful family, having
adorable and naughty little angels…”
“Rozanne, stop! Hold up!” Klein hurriedly stopped her in
exasperation when he realized that she was changing the subject. “I
just want to… to, well, understand the basics for now.”
“Alright…” Rozanne fell silent for a few seconds as she lowered her
gaze, feeling somewhat sorry. “Due to what happened to my father,
whenever I face similar problems, I tend to be… well, you know, a
little agitated. However, to be honest, I’m ﬁlled with respect towards
any man or woman who willingly wishes to be a Nighthawk.”
“I understand, I understand,” echoed Klein.
Rozanne blinked her light brown eyes and added, “My father once
said that one should never think that they can resolve hidden risks or
combat danger by simply becoming more powerful or a higher
Sequencer. In fact, it’s the opposite. They will encounter more
terrifying matters. When facing the unknown or a terrifying
existence, death and insanity are the only two outcomes. Heh, he
ended up sacriﬁcing himself two weeks after saying that… Klein,
don’t look at me with pity. My life is great now, really great! It’s only
right to feel fear towards these matters!”
“I only want to know the basics…” Klein repeated his previous reply,
not sure whether he should laugh or cry.
Captain explained it more clearly than you. And even if I do not become a
Beyonder, I have already encountered something extraordinary…
“Alright,” said Rozanne ruminatively. “I’ve heard Captain’s and Old
Neil’s conversation before. As extraordinary creatures are declining
or going extinct, few high Sequencers exist in this era. It’s already
very impressive to become a Beyonder! Combining our Tingen City
and the suburbs, there are hundreds of thousands of people or maybe
even more. Yet, there are only about thirty plus Beyonders. Well, it’s
just my guess… I’m not counting the cultists and dark warlocks who
hide in the dark…”
Without waiting for Klein’s reply, she seemed to regain her vibrancy
as she clenched her ﬁst and brought it to her chest.
“And among these thirty plus Beyonders, most of them are at
Sequence 9! Uh, it seems I have gone oﬀ topic…”
“It’s okay. That was something I wanted to know as well.” Klein
wished that Rozanne could be like her usual self, revealing more
information as she rambled on.
“Anyways, it’s already very, very impressive to become a Beyonder!”
Rozanne repeated herself. “The starting Sequence of our Church’s
complete Sequence is Sleepless: Sequence 9, Sleepless!”
Indeed… Klein nodded as he watched Rozanne ﬁnding hard to stop
herself from describing in detail.
“You should be able to guess from the name. A Sleepless is someone
who does not need to sleep at night. Three to four hours of rest in the
day would be suﬃcient. Man, I’m so envious… No, not at all! Sleep is
a gift bestowed upon us by the Goddess. It’s the truest bliss!
“Where was I? Ah, right. A Sleepless can see through the darkness
even without any lights. The deeper into the night, the more
powerful they become. I mean more powerful in the aspects of their
physical strength, their intuition, and their mental capabilities.
However, although they can detect unknown dangers that lurk in the
dark, they will still rely on demon hunting bullets and other items to
handle monsters they are unable to deal with via normal means. My
father was once a Sleepless.”
Without waiting for Klein to press on, Rozanne continued, “After
that, it’s Sequence 8’s Midnight Poet, and one level higher is
Sequence 7’s Nightmare.”
Nightmare? Klein instantly recalled that Dunn Smith had guided his
dreams. He asked as a conﬁrmation, “Captain?”
“You know about it?” Rozanne’s mouth nearly turned into an “O”
shape.
“Captain once entered my dream…” Klein glanced around as he
lowered his voice once more.
“Got it…” Rozanne was enlightened as she answered with a whisper.
She picked up a coﬀee cup beside her and took a sip before saying
wistfully, “There are only two Sequence 7 Beyonders in our Tingen
City’s Church. It’s likely that Captain is one of them. Even if he goes
to a large diocese like Backlund, he is still an impressive ﬁgure. Some
deacons might not even be stronger than he is!”
“So Captain is that impressive.” Klein echoed with a smiled.
Frankly, Dunn Smith’s appearance last night had left a deep
impression on him. He had basically believed that Dunn was an
extremely powerful Beyonder.
“Of course!” Rozanne proudly straightened her back.
In moments, the scatterbrained her said with a vexed expression, “As
for what’s above Sequence 7, I have no idea. Among all the
Nighthawks, perhaps only Captain will know.”
“Then what about other starting Sequences? The ones that aren’t
complete?” Klein was satisﬁed as he changed the subject.
It had to be said that Rozanne’s description of Sleepless did match his
imaginations and expectations of Beyonders. However, it was not the
kind he wished to become. The perfect Sequence 9 was likely one
that could study and grasp more knowledge of the mystery. By doing
so, he could leverage on them to ﬁgure out the reason for his
transmigration and lay the foundations of his future transmigration
back.
Rozanne thought for a moment before saying with a sigh, “I’m not
that interested in this aspect. I only know we have more than other
churches. After all, the Goddess is the Mother of the Secrets… Well,
there should be two or three. Some of our teammates are cold and
distant, making me fear them. They also have a strange smell to
them. Some members… Well, I mean you should talk to Old Neil. He
knows a lot, as well as quite a number of interesting magical rituals.
Let me think. He once mentioned his Sequence 9 title, which is also
the name of the potion formula… Ah, yes, it’s called Mystery Pryer.”
Quite a number of interesting magical rituals? Mystery Pryer sounds very
close to what I want… Klein was slightly delighted.
“In addition, I also know of the name of a Sequence 7, the kind that’s
incomplete!” Rozanne said with a ﬂaunting tone. She had just
thought of it while recollecting.
“What is it?” Klein was abnormally curious.
In a world where high Sequencers were scarce to the point of them
possibly not existing, Sequence 7 was probably considered quite a
potent force in the Church.
Rozanne revealed a sweet smile as she replied smugly, “Spirit
Medium!”
“Mdm. Daly?” asked Klein subconsciously.
After his initial surprise, he realized that it was nothing unexpected.
Only a Sequence 7 Beyonder could achieve such an impressive
performance as a medium!
Rozanne’s eyes widened once again as she said in disbelief, “H-how
do you know of that too?”
“I’ve met Mdm. Daly.” Klein did not hide the matter.
“Alright,” said Rozanne with an envious tone. “If I can become a
Spirit Medium, one just like Mdm. Daly, then I’ll be willing to be a
Beyonder. No, I’ll consider it carefully for ten minutes…”
“Yes, Mdm. Daly fulﬁlls all my imaginations as a Beyonder,” echoed
Klein in a slightly exaggerated manner.
Having fulﬁlled his goals, he chatted idly with Rozanne for a few
minutes until he realized he was not getting any new information. He
took of his hat and bowed before leaving.
As he walked down the stairs, Klein suddenly stopped after taking a
few steps. He reached out to pad the notes in his inner pocket.
Immediately following that, he took out twelve gold pound notes and
clenched then tightly in his left palm. Then, he reached his hand into
his pocket and refused to release or pull them out again. Without
realizing it, a smile appeared on his face.
According to the customs of the Foodaholic Empire—China—a treat
had to be given after earning money!
It’s time to give Melissa a treat tonight!
Chapter 23: Side Arm
As Klein walked down Zouteland and while taking in the warm,
humid breeze, he suddenly realized something.
He only had three pence of change. If he returned to Iron Cross Street
via public carriage, it would cost him four pence. If he were to hand
over a one-gold pound note, it would be akin to using a hundred-
dollar bull to buy a bottle of cheap mineral water back on Earth.
There was nothing wrong with that, but it was just quite awkward to
do so.
Should I use three pence to travel three kilometers and walk the rest
of the journey?Klein reached into his pocket with one hand as he
slowed down his pace, considering other solutions.
That won’t do! Soon, he rejected the idea.
It would take him a while to walk the remaining journey. Considering
how he was carrying twelve pounds—a massive fortune—it was not
safe!
Furthermore, he had deliberately not brought the revolver with him,
afraid that the Nighthawks would conﬁscate it. If he were to
encounter the danger that instigated Welch’s death, there was no way
he could ﬁght back!
Get some change from a nearby bank? No, no way! There’s a 0.5%
processing fee. That’s way too extravagant! Klein shook his head
silently. Just the thought of the fees involved pained his heart!
Having ruled out one solution after another, Klein’s eyes suddenly lit
up when he saw a clothing shop in front of him!
That’s right! Wouldn’t the normal course of action be to buy
something appropriately priced to get some change? A formal suit,
shirt, vest, trousers, leather boots, and a cane were all within budget.
They had to be bought sooner or later!
Oh, it’s very troublesome when ﬁtting clothes. Besides, Benson knows
more about this than me and he’s better at bargaining. I should
consider it only after he’s back…Then should I buy a cane? That’s
right! As the saying goes, a cane is a gentleman’s best choice of
defense. It is half as good as a crowbar. A gun in one hand and a cane
in the other is the combat style of a civilized person! After debating
internally, Klein made up his mind. He turned around and entered
the clothing shop, Wilker Clothing and Hats.
The clothing store’s layout resembled the clothing stores on Earth.
The left wall was ﬁlled with rows of formal attires. The middle rows
were decked with things like shirts, trousers, vests, and bowties. On
the right were leather shoes and boots placed inside glass cabinets.
“Sir, may I help you?” A male salesperson dressed in a white shirt
and red vest came over and asked politely.
In Loen Kingdom, rich and powerful gentlemen of high standing
enjoyed wearing black suits comprising of white shirts matched with
black vests and trousers. Their colors were relatively monotonous, so
they required their male servants, salespeople, and service attendants
to dress more brightly and colorfully, in order to distinguish
themselves from their masters.
In contrast, ladies and mistresses wore dresses of all kinds in
glamorous fashions. As such, maidservants would wear black and
white.
Klein thought for a moment before answering the male salesperson’s
question. “A cane. Something that’s heavier and harder.”
The kind that can crack the skulls of others! The red-vested
salesperson sized up Klein furtively before leading him into the store.
He then pointed at a row of canes in the corner. “That cane inlaid
with gold is made of Ironheart wood. It’s both very heavy and hard,
and costs eleven soli seven pence. Do you want to give it a try?”
Eleven soli seven pence? Why don’t you go rob a bank! Big deal with
the gold inlay!Klein was shocked by the price.
With an unperturbed expression, he nodded gently. “Alright.”
The salesperson took down the Ironheart wood cane and carefully
handed it to Klein, seemingly afraid that Klein would drop and break
the merchandise.
Klein took the cane and found it heavy. He tried moving with it and
discovered that he could not sway it smoothly as he wanted.
“It’s too heavy.” Klein shook his head in relief.
This is not an excuse! The salesperson took back the cane and pointed
at another three canes.
“This is made of walnut wood, created by Tingen’s most famous cane
artisan, Mr. Hayes. It’s priced at ten soli three pence… This is made
of ebony wood and inlaid with silver. It’s an hard as iron, costing
seven soli six pence… This is made from the core of a white boli tree
and also inlaid with silver, costing seven soli ten pence…”
Klein tried each one of them and found them of appropriate weight.
He then tapped them with his ﬁngers to gain an understand of their
hardness. Finally, he chose the cheapest one.
“I’ll take the one made from ebony wood.” Klein pointed at the cane
with the silver inlay which the salesperson was holding.
“No problem, Sir. Please follow me to proceed with the payment. In
the future, if this cane is scuﬀed or stained, you can hand it to us for
handling for free.” The salesperson led Klein to the counter.
Klein took the opportunity to release the four gold-pound notes from
his tight grip and removed two of the smaller denominations.
“Good day, Sir. It will be seven soli six pence.” The cashier behind
the counter greeted with a smile.
Klein was planning on maintaining his gentlemanly image, but when
he extended his hand with the one-gold pound note, he could not
help but ask, “Can I get a discount?”
“Sir, what we have is all hand-crafted, so our costs are very high.”
the salesperson beside him answered. “Since our boss isn’t here, we
are unable to lower the prices.”
The cashier behind the counter added, “Sir, sorry about that.”
“Alright.” Klein handed the note over and received the black silver-
inlaid cane.
While waiting for the change to be given to him, he took a few steps
back and distanced himself from them. He swung around his side arm
as a test.
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
The wind sounded heavy when the cane sliced through the air. Klein
nodded in satisfaction.
He looked forward again, prepared to see notes and coins, but was
appalled to see the red-vested salesperson retreating far away. The
cashier behind the counter had retracted into a corner, leaning close
to a double-barreled shotgun hanging to the wall.
The Loen Kingdom had a semi-regulated policy on ﬁrearms. To
possess a ﬁrearm, one needed to apply for an all-purpose weapon
usage certiﬁcate or a hunter’s license. Regardless of which type, one
could still not be in possession of restricted military ﬁrearms such as
repeaters, steam-pressured guns, or six-barrel machine guns.
An all-purpose weapon usage certiﬁcate could be used to purchase or
store any kind of civilian ﬁrearm, but earning the certiﬁcate was
extremely troublesome. Even merchants of substantial standing might
not be approved. A hunter’s license was relatively easy. Even farmers
in the suburbs could receive approval. However, the license was
limited to hunting guns with restricted numbers. People with sizable
assets would tend to apply for one to use it for self-defense in
emergency situations, such as now…
Klein looked at the two wary salespeople as the corners of his mouth
twitched. He chuckled dryly. “Not bad. This cane is perfect for
swinging. I’m very pleased.”
Realizing that he had no intention to assault them, the cashier behind
the counter relaxed. He handed over the notes and coins he had
taken out over with both hands.
Klein took a look at what he received and saw two ﬁve-soli notes,
two one-soli notes, a ﬁve-pence coin, and a one-penny coin. He could
not help but nod inwardly.
After a two-second pause, he ignored the way the salespeople looked
at him and unfurled the four notes towards the light to ensure that
the anti-counterfeit watermarks were present.
Klein put away the notes and coins when he was done. With the cane
in hand, he tipped his hat and walked out of Wilker Clothing and
Hats. He extravagantly spent six pence by taking a short-distance
trackless carriage before transferring once before reaching home safe
and sound.
After closing the door, he counted the eleven pounds and twelve soli
notes thrice before placing them into the desk drawer. He then found
the bronze revolver with the wooden grip.
Clink! Clang! Five brass bullets fell onto the table when Klein inserted
the silver demon hunting bullets which had complicated patterns and
the Dark Sacred Emblem into the revolver’s cylinder.
Like before, he only inserted ﬁve rounds and left an empty spot to
prevent any misﬁres. The remaining rounds were placed together
with the ﬁve ordinary bullets in a small iron case.
Pa! He snapped the cylinder in place, giving him a sense of security.
He excitedly lodged the revolver into the holster at his armpit and
buckled it securely. Then, he repeatedly practiced unbuckling and
drawing the gun. He rested whenever his arms ached, and this
continued until sunset when he heard the sounds of tenants walking
along the corridor outside.
Phew! Klein let out a foul breath before putting his revolver back into
his armpit holster.
Only then did he take oﬀ his formal suit and vest. He wore back his
usual brownish-yellow coat and swung his arms to relax them.
Tap. Tap. Tap. He heard the sound of nearing footsteps before the
twisting sound of an inserted key.
Melissa with her soft, black hair entered. Her nose twitched a little as
she swept her gaze towards the unlit stove. The luster in her eyes
dimmed slightly.
“Klein, I’ll heat up the leftovers from last night. Benson will likely be
home tomorrow.” Melissa turned to look at her brother.
Klein had his hands in his pocket as he leaned against the edge of the
desk. He smiled and said, “No, let’s eat out.”
“Eat out?” Melissa questioned in surprise.
“How does Silver Crown Restaurant at Daﬀodil Street sound? I heard
they serve delicious food,” suggested Klein.
“B-but…” Melissa was still confused.
Klein grinned and said, “To celebrate my new job.”
“You found a job?” Melissa’s voice rose unknowingly, “B-but, isn’t the
Tingen University interview tomorrow?”
“Another job.” Klein gave a faint smile before ﬁshing the stacked
notes from the drawer. “They even gave me an advance of four
weeks’ pay.”
Melissa looked at the gold pounds and soli as she widened her eyes.
“Goddess… You- they- what job did you get?”
This… Klein’s expression froze as he deliberated on his words.
“A security company whose mission is to seek, collect, and protect
ancient relics. They were in need of a professional consultant. It’s a
ﬁve-year contract, earning me three pounds a week.”
“Were you vexing over this last night?” asked Melissa after a moment
of silence.
Klein nodded. “Yes, although being an academic at Tingen University
is respectable, I prefer this job.”
“Well, it isn’t bad either.” Melissa gave an encouraging smile. She
asked half-suspiciously and half-curiously, “Why would they give you
an advance payment of four full weeks?”
“It’s because we need to move. We need a place with more rooms and
a bathroom that belongs to us,” said Klein while grinning and
shrugging.
He felt that his smile was impeccable, just short of the word:
“Surprised?”
Melissa was stunned momentarily before she suddenly spoke out in a
ﬂuster, “Klein, we are living quite well now. My occasional
grumblings of not having a personal bathroom is just a habit. Do you
remember Jenny? She lived next door to us, but ever since her father
was injured and lost his job, they had no choice but to move to Lower
Street. The family of ﬁve ended up staying in one room, with three of
them sleeping in a bunk bed and two of them sleeping on the ground.
They even wish to rent the remaining empty spot to someone…
“Compared to them, we are really very lucky. Don’t waste your salary
on this matter. Besides, I love Mrs. Smyrin’s bakery.”
Sis, why is your reaction completely diﬀerent from how it played out
in my head…Klein’s expression went blank when he heard his sister.
Chapter 24: Penny-pincher
The sky outside was gradually dyed golden as Klein looked into
Melissa’s eyes. He was momentarily at a loss for words; none of the
lines he prepared could be used.
He coughed lightly twice as he quickly racked his brains.
“Melissa, this isn’t a waste of salary. In the future, my colleagues, as
well as Benson’s colleagues might visit. Are we going to host them in
such a place? When Benson and I get married and have wives, are we
still going to sleep in bunk beds?”
“None of you have ﬁancées yet, right? We can wait a little while and
save up more money in the meantime,” answered Melissa in a
logically concise manner.
“No, Melissa. This is a societal rule.” Klein was stumped and could
only count on lofty principles. “Since I’m earning three pounds a
week, I should look like I’m earning three pounds a week.”
To be honest, having rented an apartment before with others, Zhou
Mingrui was no stranger to his present living conditions as Klein. He
was very used to it, but it was because of his past experience that he
knew how inconvenient such an environment was for a girl.
Furthermore, his goal was to become a Beyonder and study mysticism
to ﬁnd his way home. In the future, he was bound to conduct some
magical rituals at home. Having too many people in the apartment
building made incidents prone to happen.
Klein saw that Melissa was about to continue arguing, and hurriedly
added, “Don’t worry. I’m not planning to get a bungalow, but
probably a terrace. Basically, it has to have a bathroom we can call
ours. Also, I like Mrs. Smyrin’s bread, Tingen biscuits, and lemon
cakes too. We can ﬁrst consider places near Iron Cross Street and
Daﬀodil Street.”
Melissa pouted her lips slightly and fell silent for a moment before
nodding slowly.
“Besides, I’m in no rush to move either. We have to wait for Benson
to return,” said Klein with a chuckle. “We can’t have him be shocked
when he opens the door to ﬁnd nothing, right? Imagine him saying in
astonishment—’Where are my things? Where are my siblings?
Where’s my home? Is this my home? Did I make a mistake? Goddess,
wake me up if this is a dream. Why is my home gone after a few days
of absence!?'”
His mimicking of Benson’s tone made Melissa involuntarily smile as
her eyes scrunched up and revealed her shallow dimples.
“No, Mr. Franky would deﬁnitely be waiting by the door to get
Benson to hand over the apartment keys. Benson wouldn’t even be
able to come up.” The girl disparaged the miserly landlord.
In the Moretti household, all of them would like to make Mr. Franky
the butt of their jokes for every trivial and major matter. It was all
thanks to Benson who initiated this practice.
“Right, there’s no way he would switch locks for the tenants after us,”
Klein echoed with a smile. He pointed at the door and quipped, “Miss
Melissa, shall we head to Silver Crown Restaurant for a celebration?”
Melissa sighed gently and said, “Klein, do you know Selena? My
classmate and my good friend?”
Selena? An image of a girl with wine-red hair and deep brown eyes
surfaced in Klein’s mind. Her parents were Evernight Goddess
believers. They had named her after St. Selena as a blessing. She was
not yet sixteen, and was half a year younger than Melissa. She was a
happy, cheerful, and outgoing lady.
“Yes.” Klein nodded in aﬃrmation.
“Her elder brother, Chris, is a lawyer. He currently earns close to
three pounds a week as well. His ﬁancée works part time as a typist,”
described Melissa. “They have been engaged for more than four
years. To ensure a decent and stable life after marriage, they are still
saving money to this very day. They have yet to go down the
wedding aisle and plan to wait for at least another year. According to
Selena, there are many people like her brother. They typically get
married after twenty-eight. You have to be make advanced
preparations and save up. Don’t squander your money.”
It’s just a meal at a restaurant. Is there a need to preach at me… Klein
was rendered at a loss whether to laugh or cry. After a few seconds of
thought, he said, “Melissa, I’m already earning three pounds a week,
and I’ll have increments every year. There’s no need for you to
worry.”
“But we need to save some money in the case of any unexpected
emergencies. For example, what if that security company suddenly
closes down? I have a classmate whose father’s company went
bankrupt. He had to ﬁnd temporary work at the pier and their living
conditions turned terrible instantly. She had no choice but to quit
school,” advised Melissa with a serious expression.
… Klein extended his hand to cover his face. “T-that security
company and the government… Yes, has some connections with the
government. It will not easily close down.”
“But even the government isn’t stable. After every election, if the
party in power changes, many people will have their positions
stripped oﬀ. It turns into a mess.” Melissa retorted in an unyielding
manner.
…Sis, you sure know a lot… Klein found the humor in his exasperation
as he shook his head. “Alright then…
“Then I’ll boil some soup with the leftovers from yesterday. Buy some
pan-fried ﬁsh, a slab of black-pepper beef, a small bottle of butter,
and a cup of malt beer for me. Anyway, there should still be some
celebration.”
They were commonly sold items by hawkers on Iron Cross Street. A
piece of pan-fried ﬁsh was six to eight pence; a not-so-big piece of
black-peppered beef was ﬁve pence; a cup of malt beer was a penny;
and a bottle of butter weighing about a quarter pound was four
pence, but buying a pound of butter would only cost one soli three
pence.
The original Klein was responsible for buying ingredients during
holidays, so he was no stranger to the prices. Klein did a mental
estimate that Melissa would need about one soli six pence. Therefore,
he took out two one-soli notes.
“Alright.” Melissa did not object to Klein’s proposal. She put down
her backpack of stationery and took the notes.
When he saw his sister taking out a tiny bottle for the butter and pots
for the other food before briskly walking to the door, Klein thought
for a moment and shouted out to her. “Melissa, use the remaining
money to buy some fruits.”
There were many hawkers on Iron Cross Street who would buy low-
quality or expiring fruits from other places. The residents were not
outraged about this because the prices were extremely cheap. They
could taste the magniﬁcent ﬂavors after removing the rotten parts, so
it was a cheap enjoyment.
With that said, Klein took a few brisk steps forward and took out the
remaining copper pennies from his pocket and stuﬀed it into his
sister’s palm.
“Ah?” Melissa’s brown eyes looked at her brother in puzzlement.
Klein took two steps back and smiled. “Remember to go to Mrs.
Smyrin’s. Reward yourself with a tiny lemon cake.”
“…” Melissa’s mouth widened as she blinked. Finally, she said a
single word, “Okay.”
She quickly turned around, opened the door, and ran toward the
stairwell.
…
A river tore through the land, with cedar and maple trees lining the
banks; the air so fresh, it was intoxicating.
Klein, who was here to put closure to his interview, had his revolver
with him. He held his cane and paid six pence for the public carriage.
He walked down a cemented path and approached a three-story stone
building which was shaded by greenery. It was Tingen University’s
administrative block.
“It’s truly worthy of being one of the two major universities of the
Loen Kingdom…” With this being his ﬁrst time here, Klein sighed as
he walked.
Compared to Tingen University, Khoy University right across the
river could only be described as shabby.
“Heave-ho!”
“Heave-ho!”
Voices approached slowly as two rowing boats made their way
upstream across the Khoy River. Oars were being rowed in an orderly
and rhythmic manner.
This was a rowing sport that was popular among all the universities
in Loen Kingdom. With Klein requiring a scholarship to ﬁnance his
university studies, he, Welch, and the others had joined Khoy
University’s rowing club and were pretty good at it.
“This is youth…” Klein stopped and looked into the distance before
sighing wistfully.
Such sights would no longer be seen in another week since school
would break for summer.
As he proceeded down a road sheltered by trees, Klein stopped by a
three-story stone building. He entered after successfully registering
himself and easily found his way to the oﬃce of the person who had
tended to him the other time.
Knock! Knock! Knock! He knocked lightly on the half-closed door.
“Come in.” A man’s voice sounded from inside.
A middle-aged instructor dressed in a white shirt and black tuxedo
frowned when he saw Klein enter. “There’s another hour until the
interview.”
“Mr. Stone, do you still remember me? I’m a student of Senior
Associate Professor Cohen, Klein Moretti. You have read my
recommendation letter before.” Klein smiled as he took oﬀ his hat.
Harvin Stone stroked his black beard and asked, puzzled, “Is there
something wrong? I’m not in charge of interviews.”
“Here’s the situation. I’ve already found a job, so I won’t be
participating in the interview today.” Klein gave his reason for
coming.
“I see…” When Harvin Stone learned of the reason, he stood up and
reached out his right hand. “Congratulations. You are really a polite
lad. I will inform the professor and senior associate professors.”
Klein shook Harvin’s hand and planned on making a little small talk
before bidding him farewell when he heard a familiar voice behind
him.
“Moretti, you found another job?”
Klein turned around and saw an elder with a head of silver hair that
left a deep impression on his silhouette. His deep, blue eyes sunk
deep into his face and he had few wrinkles. The man looked sharp in
his black tuxedo.
“Good afternoon, Mentor. Mr. Azik,” he hurriedly greeted. “Why are
the two of you here?”
The elder was none other than Senior Associate Professor of Khoy
University’s history department, who was also his mentor, Mr.
Quentin Cohen. Beside Cohen was a middle-aged man with bronze-
colored skin of average build. He did not have any facial hair and
held a newspaper in his hand. His hair was black and his pupils
brown. His facial features were soft as his eyes revealed an
indescribable sense of weariness like it had seen the vicissitudes of
life. Beneath his right ear was a black mole which could only be seen
if looked at carefully.
Khoy University recognized him since he was Khoy University’s
history department lecturer, Mr. Azik, who often helped the original
Klein. He enjoyed debating with his mentor, Senior Associate
Professor Cohen. They often had a clash of opinion, but even so, they
were best friends; otherwise, they would not have enjoyed meeting
up for a chat.
Cohen nodded and said with a relaxed tone, “Azik and I are here to
participate in an academic conference. What kind of job did you
get?”
“It’s a security company which seeks, collects, and protects ancient
relics. They were in need of a professional consultant and are paying
me three pounds a week.” Klein repeated what he said to his sister
yesterday. Following that, he explained, “As you know, I prefer
exploring history, instead of summarizing it.”
Cohen nodded slightly and said, “Everyone has their own choices. I’m
very happy that you bothered to come to Tingen University to inform
them instead of just not showing up.”
At that moment, Azik interjected, “Klein, do you know what
happened to Welch and Naya? I read on the newspapers that they
were killed by burglars.”
The incident has become a case of armed burglary? And why it is already
on the newspapers? Klein was taken aback as he weighed over his
words.
“I’m not very clear of the speciﬁcs as well. Welch had obtained a
diary of the Solomon Empire’s Antigonus family from the Fourth
Epoch. My help on interpreting it was sought. I helped them for the
ﬁrst few days, but I later got busy with job hunting. The police even
came to me two days ago.”
He deliberately divulged the matter regarding the Solomon Empire
and the Antigonus family in hopes of getting any information from
the two history teachers.
“The Fourth Epoch…” Cohen muttered with a frown.
The bronze-skinned and weary eyes of Azik went blank ﬁrst before he
inhaled. He rubbed his temple with his newspaper-wielding left hand
and said, “Antigonus… rings a bell… But why can’t I remember…”
Chapter 25: Cathedral
While Azik muttered to himself, he subconsciously shot a glance at
Quentin Cohen, seemingly hoping for hints to jolt his memories.
Cohen, with his deep set blue eyes, shook his head without any
hesitation. “I do not have any impression of it.”
“…Alright then. Perhaps, it just shares a root word.” Azik lowered his
left hand and gave a self-deprecating laugh.
Klein was rather disappointed with the outcome, and he could not
help but add on. “Mentor, Mr. Azik, as the both of you know, I’m
very interested in exploring and restoring the history of the Fourth
Epoch. If you ever recall anything or obtain relevant information,
could you please write to me?”
“No problem.” As a result of Klein’s actions today, the silver-haired
Senior Associate Professor was rather pleased with him.
Azik also nodded and said, “Is your address still the same as before?”
“For now, but I’ll be moving soon. I’ll write a letter to inform you
when the time comes,” replied Klein in a respectful manner.
Cohen shook his black cane and said, “It’s indeed about time you
moved to a place with a better environment.”
At that moment, Klein caught a glance at the newspaper in Azik’s
hand. He deliberated on his words before saying, “Mentor, Mr. Azik,
what did the newspapers say regarding Welch and Naya? I only
learned a little from the police who were in charge of the
investigations.”
Azik was just about to answer when Cohen suddenly pulled out the
pocket watch that was linked to his black tuxedo by a golden chain.
Click! He opened the pocket watch and tapped his cane.
“The meeting is about to begin. Azik, we can’t be delayed any
further. Give the newspaper to Moretti.”
“Alright.” Azik handed over the newspaper he had read to Klein. “We
will be going upstairs. Remember to write a letter. Our address has
yet to change; it’s still the Khoy University History Department
Oﬃce. Haha.”
He laughed as he turned around and left the room with Cohen.
Klein took oﬀ his hat and bowed. After watching the two gentlemen
leave, he bade farewell to owner of the oﬃce, Harvin Stone. He
proceeded across the corridor and slowly exited the gray three-story
building.
With his back against the sun, he lifted up his cane and unfolded the
newspaper and saw the title: “Tingen Morning Post.”
Tingen sure has all sorts of newspapers and magazines… There is the
Morning Post, Evening Post, the Honest Paper, Backlund Daily
Tribune, Tussock Times, family magazines and book reviews… Klein
casually recalled the several names that surfaced in his mind. Of
course, a number of them were not local. They were distributed via
steam locomotives.
Now that the papermaking and printing industries were getting more
advanced, the cost of a newspaper has already decreased to the price
of a penny. The audience it reached also grew wider and wider.
Klein did not scrutinize the details of the newspaper, quickly ﬂipping
to the News section with the report “Armed Burglary Murder.”
“…According to the police department, the scene at Mr. Welch’s
home was a horrible sight. There was missing gold, jewelry, and
money, as well as anything valuable that could be easily taken away.
Not even a penny was left behind. There is reason to believe that this
was done by a merciless group of criminals that would not hesitate to
kill the innocent, such as Mister Welch and Madam Naya, if sight of
their faces are caught.”
“This is outright contempt for our kingdom’s laws! This is a challenge
to public security! No one wishes to have such an encounter! Of
course, one piece of good news is that the police have located the
murderer and captured the main culprit. We will do our best to
provide news on any follow-ups.”
“Reporter: John Browning.”
The matter has been handled and covered up… As Klein walked
through the boulevard, he nodded in a hardly noticeable manner.
He ﬂipped through the newspaper as he strolled down the path,
reading the other news articles and serials in the process.
Suddenly, he felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand, as though
needles were stabbing at him.
Someone is watching me? Observing me? Monitoring me? Various
thoughts welled up in him as Klein had a faint realization.
Back on Earth, he had once felt an invisible gaze before ultimately
discovering the source of the gaze. However, it had never felt as
crystal clear as what he was experiencing now!
This was the same in the original Klein’s memory fragments!
Was it the transmigration or the mysterious luck enhancement ritual
which enhanced my sixth sense? Klein fought back the urge to seek
out the observer. Using his knowledge from reading novels and
watching movies, he slowed his pace and put away the newspaper
before looking toward Khoy River.
Following that, he acted as if he was admiring the scenery, slowly
turning his head in diﬀerent directions. He acted natural as he turned
around, taking in everything with his eyes.
Other than the trees, grassy plains, and students passing by in the
distance, there was no other person there.
But Klein was certain that someone was watching him!
This… Klein’s heart raced as his blood surged through his body with
the intense thumping.
He unfolded the papers and covered half his face, afraid that anyone
would discover anything wrong with his expression.
Meanwhile, he clenched his cane and readied himself to draw his
gun.
One step. Two steps. Three steps. Klein proceeded forward slowly.
The feeling of being spied upon remained, but there was no sudden
outburst of danger.
He walked through the boulevard in a somewhat stiﬀ manner and
arrived at the waiting point for public carriages when a carriage
pulled up coincidentally.
“Iron… Zoute… No, Champagne Street.” Klein continually dismissed
his thoughts.
He originally planned on heading home immediately, but he was
afraid of leading an observer of unknown motives to his apartment.
Following that, he thought of heading to Zouteland Street to seek
help from the Nighthawks or his colleagues. However, he thought
otherwise, afraid that he would end up alerting his enemy and expose
the Nighthawks. Therefore, he casually chose somewhere else.
“Six pence,” the ticketing oﬃcer replied routinely.
Klein did not bring any gold pounds with him today. He had hidden
the money in the usual spot and had only taken two soli notes with
him. And before he came, he had spent the same amount of money,
leaving him with one soli six pence. Therefore, he took out all his
coins and handed to the ticketing oﬃcer.
He found a seat after boarding the carriage, and ﬁnally with the
closing of the carriage doors, Klein felt that unease of being watched
vanish!
He exhaled slowly as he felt his limbs tingle slightly.
What do I do?
What should I do next? Klein looked out the carriage as he racked his
brains for a solution.
Until he was clear about the intentions of the person watching him,
Klein had to assume that there was malicious intent!
Many thoughts sprang up in his mind, but he dismissed them. He had
never experienced such an event, and had to use a few minutes to
organize his ideas.
He had to notify the Nighthawks; only they could truly get rid of this
threat!
But I can’t head there directly or I might expose them. Perhaps, that
might be their goal…
Following this train of thought, Klein crudely surmised various
possibilities as his thoughts turned clearer.
Fﬀﬀﬀf! He exhaled as he regained some semblance of composure. He
looked seriously at the scenery outside ﬂying past him.
There were no accidents along the way to Champagne Street, but
when Klein opened the door and stepped out of the car, he
immediately had the uneasy feeling of being watched again!
He acted as though he had not sensed anything. He took the
newspaper and his cane, slowly making his way in the direction of
Zouteland Street.
But he did not enter that street. Instead, he took another route to the
Red Moonlight Street behind. There was a beautiful white plaza
there, as well as a large cathedral with a pointy roof!
Saint Selena Cathedral!
The Tingen headquarters of the Church of the Evernight Goddess!
As a believer, there was nothing odd about him participating in Mass
or pray on his day oﬀ.
The cathedral exhibited a design similar to Earth’s Gothic style. It
also had a tall, black, and imposing clock tower, situated between
blue and red checkered windows.
Klein stepped into the cathedral and followed an aisle into the prayer
hall. Along the way, the stained windows were comprised of red and
blue glass patterns that allowed colored light to shine into the hall.
The blue was closer to black, the red the same color as the crimson
moon. It made the surroundings seem unusually dark and mysterious.
The feeling of being watched vanished. Klein acted unfazed as he
walked toward the open prayer hall.
There were no high windows here. The deep darkness was
emphasized, but behind the arc-shaped holy altar, on the wall
directly opposite the door, were about twenty circular ﬁst-sized holes
that allowed the radiant sunlight to enter the hall.
It was akin to pedestrians seeing the starry sky when suddenly
looking up into the dark night to see the shimmering stars in all their
nobility, purity, and holiness.
Even though Klein had always believed that gods could be analyzed
and understood, he could not help but lower his head here.
The bishop was preaching in a gentle tone as Klein silently made his
way down the aisle that split the pews into two columns. He searched
for an empty area close to the passageway before slowly taking a
seat.
Leaning his cane onto the back of the pew in front of him, Klein took
oﬀ his hat and placed it onto his lap together with the newspaper.
Then he clasped his hands together and lowered his head.
The entire process was done slowly and routinely as though he was
really there to pray.
Klein closed his eyes as he silently listened to the bishop’s voice in
the darkness.
“Lacking clothes and food, they have no covering in the cold.
“They are drenched by rains, and huddle around the rocks for lack of
shelter.
“They are orphans snatched from the breast, hope lost on them; they
are the poor that have been forced oﬀ the proper path.
“The Evernight did not forsake them, but bestowed them with love
<sup>1</sup> .”
…
Echoes ampliﬁed as they entered his ear. Klein saw a swath of
darkness in front of him as he felt his spirit and mind cleansed.
He calmly took it in until the bishop ﬁnished his preachings and
ended Mass.
After which, the bishop opened a confessional door beside him. Men
and women began lining up.
Klein opened his eyes and donned his hat once more. With his cane
and newspaper, he stood up and found his place in line.
It was his turn after more than twenty minutes.
He stepped in and closed the door behind him. There was darkness in
front of him.
“My child, what do you wish to say?” The bishop’s voice sounded
from behind the wooden damper screen.
Klein took out the ‘Seventh Unit, Special Operations Department’
badge from his pocket and handed it over to the bishop through an
opening.
“Someone is tailing me. I wish to ﬁnd Dunn Smith.” As though he
had been infected by the silent darkness, his tone turned softer as
well.
The bishop took the badge and after a few seconds of silence, he said,
“Turn right from the confession booth and walk to the end. There
will be a secret door to the side. Someone will lead the way after you
enter.”
As he spoke, he pulled a rope inside the room, causing a particular
priest to hear a chime.
Klein retrieved his badge and took oﬀ his hat and pressed it to his
chest. He gave a slight bow before turning around and exiting.
After conﬁrming that the feeling of being watched was gone, he wore
his halved top hat. Without any excessive emotions, he held his cane
and turned right, until he arrived by an arched altar.
He found the secret door in the wall facing his side. He silently
opened it before sneaking in quickly.
The secret door closed silently as a middle-aged, black-robed priest
appeared under the illumination of gas lamps.
“What is it?” the priest asked tersely.
Klein showed his badged and repeated what he said to the bishop.
The middle-aged priest did not ask further questions. He turned
around and proceeded forward in silence.
Klein nodded and took oﬀ his hat. With his black cane, he followed
silently in tow.
Rozanne had once mentioned that heading left from the crossroads
towards Chanis Gate would reach Saint Selena Cathedral.
Chapter 26: Practice
Tap! Tap! Tap! The sound of footsteps echoed through the dark,
narrow corridor, which was otherwise silent.
Klein kept his back straight as he kept up with the priest’s pace. He
did not pose questions or chat idly with him, remaining silent like a
windless body of water.
After passing through the heavily guarded passageway, the priest
opened a secret door with a key and pointed down a stairwell made
of stone. “Turn left at the intersection to reach Chanis Gate.”
“May Goddess bless you.” Klein gestured the sign of the crimson
moon on his chest.
Commoners practiced etiquette, while the religious partook in ritual
blessings.
“Praise the Lady.” The priest returned with the same gesture.
Klein did not speak further as he walked down the dark stone
stairwell with the aid of the reﬁned inlaid gas lamps on both sides of
the wall.
Midway, he subconsciously turned back and saw the priest standing
at the entrance. He was in the shadows and appeared like an
immobile wax statue.
Klein looked away and continued to proceed down. It did not take
long before he hit ground laid with ice-cold stone slabs. This led him
to the intersection.
He did not turn towards Chanis Gate because Dunn Smith, who had
recently ﬁnished his shift, was deﬁnitely not there.
He turned right and saw the familiar path. Klein went back up
another ﬂight of stairs and appeared inside Blackthorn Security
Company.
Seeing doors that were tightly shut or half-closed, he did not rush
into them. Instead, he went to the reception and saw a brown-haired
girl focused on a magazine with a sweet smile.
“Hi, Rozanne.” Klein came to her side and deliberately rapped the
table.
Knock! Rozanne stood up suddenly and knocked over a chair and said
in a ﬂuster, “Hi, nice weather today. Y-you, Klein, why are you
here?”
She patted her chest and heaved a few sighs of relief. She was like a
young lady afraid that her father had caught her skiving.
“I need to ﬁnd Captain,” answered Klein simply.
“…You gave me a fright. I thought Captain came out.” Rozanne
glared at Klein. “Don’t you know how to knock!? Hmph, you should
be thankful that I’m a tolerant and kind woman. Well, I do prefer the
term lady… Is there a reason why you are looking for Captain? He’s
in the room opposite Mrs. Orianna.”
Even though he felt uptight, Klein was so amused by Rozanne he
smiled. He pondered for a moment before saying, “A secret.”
“…” Rozanne’s eyes widened and while she reeled in her disbelief,
Klein did a slight bow before bidding her farewell.
He went through the reception’s partition and knocked on the door of
the ﬁrst oﬃce on the right.
“Come in.” Dunn Smith’s deep and gentle voice sounded.
Klein pushed the door and opened before closing the door behind
him. He took oﬀ his hat and bowed. “Good morning, Captain.”
“Good morning, how can I help you?” Dunn’s black windbreaker and
hat were hanging on a clothes stand to his side. He was dressed in a
white shirt and black vest. Even though his hairline was rather high,
his gray eyes were deep, and he appeared much fresher.
“Someone is following me.” Klein honestly answered without any
embellishments.
Dunn leaned back and clasped his hands together. His deep gray eyes
silently looked at Klein’s eyes. He did not follow up on the topic of
being followed and instead, asked, “You came from the cathedral?”
“Yes.” Klein answered.
Dunn nodded gently. He did not comment on its merits or demerits as
he switched the subject back. “It might be that Welch’s father doesn’t
believe the cause of death that we reported and had hired a private
investigator from Wind City to investigate the matter.”
Midseashire’s Constant City was also known as Wind City. It was a
region with extremely advanced coal and steel industries. It was one
of the top three cities of Loen Kingdom.
Before waiting for Klein to give his opinion, Dunn continued, “It
might also be a result of that notebook. Heh, we happened to be
investigating where Welch received the Antigonus family’s notebook.
Of course, we can’t eliminate other people or organizations that
might be seeking out this notebook.”
“What should I do?” Klein asked in a serious voice.
Without a question, he hoped that it was the ﬁrst reason.
Dunn did not immediately answer him. He raised his coﬀee mug and
took a mouthful, his eyes not showing the sliver of a ripple. “Return
the way you came, then do anything you wish.”
“Anything?” Klein returned with a question.
“Anything.” Dunn nodded with certainty. “Of course, do not scare
them oﬀ or violate the law.”
“Alright.” Klein took a deep breath and bade him farewell. He left the
room and went back underground.
He turned left at the intersection, and bathed in the light from the
gas lamps on the two walls, he arrived silently to the empty, dark,
and cold passageway.
The sound of his footsteps echoed, making him sound more alone and
terriﬁed.
Soon, Klein arrived at the stairwell. He went forward and saw a
shadow standing there—the middle-aged priest.
The two did not say a word when they met. The priest turned around
in silence and made way.
He proceeded silently before returning to the prayer hall. The circular
holes behind the arched altar were still as pure and bright, while the
darkness and silence of the building’s interior remained. There were
still men and women lining outside the confessional, but much fewer
than before.
After waiting for a moment, Klein slowly left the prayer hall with his
cane and newspaper as though nothing had ever happened,
successfully leaving Saint Selena Cathedral.
The moment he walked out, he saw the burning sun. He immediately
regained the familiar feeling of being observed. He felt like he was
prey being eyed by a hawk.
Suddenly, a question surfaced in his mind.
Why didn’t the “observer” follow me into the cathedral? Although I
could have still used the dark environment and the priest to conceal
my temporary disappearance, would it be hard for him to continue
monitoring me by pretending to pray? If he had not done something
wrong, there would be no problem walking in with an open and
aboveboard manner, right? Unless the person has some dark history,
making him afraid of the Church or fear the bishop, knowing that he
might have the powers of a Beyonder.
In that case, the likelihood of it being a private investigator is very
slim… Klein exhaled and no longer acted as nervous as he was
previously. He took a casual stroll before going around and to the
back of Zouteland Street.
He stopped at an ancient-styled building with mottled walls. The
address on the door was ‘3.’ Its name was the Zouteland Shooting
Club.
Part of the police department’s underground shooting range was
opened to the public as a way to earn some additional funds.
Klein went in and the feeling of being watched vanished instantly. He
took this opportunity to hand over his Special Operations Department
badge to the attendant.
After a short veriﬁcation, he was led underground to a small,
conﬁned shooting range.
“Ten-meter target.” Klein informed the attendant simply. Next, he
retrieved the revolver from his armpit holster and the box of brass
bullets from his pocket.
The feeling of being suddenly targeted made his desire to protect
himself win over his procrastination. Therefore, he could not wait to
come over to practice his shooting.
Pa! After the attendant left, he ﬂicked open the cylinder and removed
the silver demon hunting bullets. Following that, he ﬁlled the
cylinder with normal brass bullets.
This time, neither did he leave an empty spot to prevent misﬁring,
nor did he take oﬀ his formal attire and halved top hat. He planned
on practicing in his usual getup. After all, it was impossible for him
to shout “wait a minute, let me change into something more
comfortable” after encountering an enemy or danger.
Click! Klein closed the cylinder and rolled it with his thumb.
Suddenly, he held the gun in both hands, raised it up straight, and
aimed at the target more than ten meters away.
However, he was in no hurry to shoot. Instead, he recalled his
experience at military training <sup>1</sup> , how to form a line
with the iron-sights, and knowledge about a gun’s recoil.
Rustle! Rustle! While his clothes rustled, Klein repeated his aiming
and his holding stance. He was as serious as a student taking a high-
school exam.
After repeating it several times, he retreated to the wall and sat down
on a long, soft bench. He placed the revolver to the side, began
massaging his arms, and rested for quite a while.
He spent a few minutes recalling his practice before he picked up the
revolver with the wooden handle and bronze cylinder. He got into
standard ﬁring position and pulled the trigger.
Bang! His arm trembled as his body moved back from the recoil. The
bullet missed the target.
Bang! Bang! Bang! Drawing from the experience he gained, he shot
again and again until all six rounds were ﬁnished.
I’m starting to hit the target… Klein stepped back and sat down again
as he exhaled.
Click! He swung the cylinder out and allowed the six shells to fall to
the ground. Then, without a change in expression, he inserted the
remaining brass rounds in.
After relaxing his arm, Klein stood up again and returned to his
shooting position.
Bang! Bang! Bang! Ringing shots echoed as the target shook. Klein
practiced and rested repeatedly. He expended all thirty normal
rounds and the remaining ﬁve from before. He gradually hit the
target and started aiming for the bull’s eye.
He swung his sore shoulders and threw out the ﬁnal ﬁve shells. He
lowered his head and inserted the demon hunting bullets with the
complicated patterns back into gun, leaving an empty spot to prevent
misﬁring.
After putting the revolver back into his armpit holster, Klein patted
the dust from his body and walked out the shooting range to return
to the streets.
The feeling of being observed arose once again. Klein felt calmer than
he previously felt as he slowly walked to Champagne Street. He spent
four pence on a tracked carriage to return to Iron Cross Street before
returning to his own apartment.
The feeling of being spied upon vanished without a trace. Klein took
out his keys and opened the door to see a short-haired man nearing
his thirties and wearing a linen shirt seated at a desk.
His heart tensed up before relaxing immediately. Klein greeted with a
smile, “Good morning—no—good afternoon, Benson.”
This man was none other than Klein’s and Melissa’s elder brother,
Benson Moretti. He was only twenty-ﬁve this year, but his receding
hairline and decrepit appearance made him look nearly thirty.
He had black hair and brown eyes, resembling Klein somewhat, but
he lacked the faint scholarly air which Klein had.
“Good afternoon, Klein. How was the interview?” Benson stood up as
he grinned.
His black coat and halved top hat were hanging on a protrusion of
their bunk bed.
“Horrible,” Klein replied in a deadpan manner.
When he saw Benson stunned, Klein chuckled and added, “In fact, I
didn’t even participate in the interview. I found a job ahead of the
interview and it pays three pounds a week…”
He repeated what he told Melissa again.
Benson’s expression calmed down as he shook his head with a laugh.
“It feels like I’m seeing a child grow up… Well, this job is pretty
good.” He sighed and said, “It’s great that the ﬁrst thing I heard is
such good news after being away for work. Let’s celebrate tonight
and buy some beef?”
Klein smiled. “Sure, but I believe Melissa will feel the pinch. Let’s buy
some ingredients later in the afternoon? Let’s bring at least three soli?
Well, to be honest, a pound exchanges for twenty soli, and one soli
exchanges for twelve pence. There are even denominations like the
halfpence and quarterpence. Such a coin system just goes against
logic. It’s so troublesome. I think it must be one of the most foolish
coin system in the world.”
When he said that, he saw Benson’s expression turn stern. Feeling a
little unease, he wondered if he had said anything wrong.
Could it be that in the lost memory fragments of the original Klein,
Benson was an outright, extreme nationalist who showed no
tolerance for any negativity? Benson took a few steps and refuted him
with a stern expression. “No, it is not one of, but the most foolish
coin system.”
Not one of! Klein was taken aback, but he quickly snapped to his
senses. He looked at his brother in the eye and laughed.
Indeed, Benson was great at mocking humor.
Benson lifted the corners of his lips and said in all seriousness, “You
should understand that to institute a reasonable and simple coin
system, one needs to know how to count and grasp the decimal
system. Unfortunately, there are too few talents among those
important ﬁgures.”
Chapter 27: Siblings' Dinner
It’s simply sharp and incisive… Klein burst out in laughter. Using the
rich experience he had from his previous incarnation, he added
another insult. “In fact, there is no evidence to suggest that those
important ﬁgures have any brains at all.”
“Good! Very good!” Benson roared with laughter as he gave a thumbs
up. “Klein, you are a lot more humorous than before.”
After taking a breath, he continued, “I have to go to the pier in the
afternoon. I’m only oﬀ work tomorrow. After that I’ll have time… to
go to Tingen City Housing Improvement Company with the both of
you. Let’s see if they have cheap and good terrace houses for rent.
Also, I need to pay Mr. Franky a visit.”
“Our landlord?” the perplexed Klein asked. Does our current landlord
have some terrace houses from pretty good districts under his name?
Benson shot his brother a glance and said, amused, “Have you
forgotten the one-year rental contract we have with him? It has only
been six months.”
“Hiss…” Klein immediately drew a gasp of cold air.
He had really forgotten the matter!
Although rent was paid once a week, the lease was a year long. If
they were to move now, it was equivalent to a breach in contract. If
they were taken to court, they would have to compensate large sums
of money!
“You are still lacking in societal experience.” Benson touched his
receding black hairline and said wistfully, “This was a clause I fought
so hard back then. If not, Mr. Franky was only willing to lease it to us
for three months each contract. To those with money, landlords
would sign leases for a year, two years, or even three years to seek
stable income. But for us—the past us—and our neighbors, landlords
would have to be constantly worried that something bad might
happen, depriving them of their rent. Therefore, they would only sign
short-term contracts.
“In that case, they can oﬀer to raise prices according to the
situation.” Klein summarized and added, using the original Klein’s
memories and his own experience as a tenant.
Benson sighed and said, “This is the cruel reality of today’s society.
Alright, you don’t have to worry. The issue with the contract can be
easily resolved. To be frank, even if we owe him a week’s rent, Mr.
Franky would have immediately thrown us out and conﬁscated
whatever valuable items we have. After all, his intelligence is below
that of a monkey’s. There’s no way he can comprehend overly
complicated matters.”
Upon hearing this, Klein suddenly recalled a particular Sir
Humphrey’s meme. He shook his head and said seriously, “No,
Benson. You are wrong.”
“Why?” Benson was puzzled.
“Mr. Franky’s intelligence is still slightly higher than a monkey’s,”
Klein replied in all seriousness. Just as Benson seemed to smile in
response, he added, “If he is on form.”
“Haha.” Benson lost it and burst out in laughter.
After a series of rapturous laughter, he pointed at Klein, momentarily
unable to put his thoughts in words. Only then, he returned to the
topic at hand.
“Of course, as a gentleman, we cannot employ such shameless tactics.
I will discuss this with Mr. Franky tomorrow. Believe me, he’s easily
convinced, easily.”
Klein had no doubts regarding Benson’s point. The existence of the
gas pipes was excellent proof.
After some idle chatter between the brothers, the remnants of pan-
fried ﬁsh from the previous night were made into a soup with some
vegetables. During the boiling process, the steam moistened the rye
bread.
Smearing a little butter on the bread, Klein and Benson had a simple
meal, but they were very satisﬁed with it. After all the fragrance and
sweetness of butter brought them endless aftertastes.
After Benson left, Klein headed to the Lettuce and Meat market with
three Soli notes and some spare pennies. He spent six pence on a
pound of beef and seven pence on a fresh and succulent ﬁsh with few
bones. Additionally, he bought potatoes, peas, radishes, rhubarbs,
lettuce, and turnips, as well as spices such as rosemary, basil, cumin,
and cooking oils.
During this entire time, he continued to feel like he was being
watched, but there was no physical interaction.
After spending some time at Smyrin Bakery, Klein returned home and
began weight-lifting with heavier items such as books to train his arm
strength.
He had planned to exercise by military boxing, which he learned
from his compulsory military stint for students. However, he had
already forgotten the radio exercise routines from school, much less
boxing which was only taught during the military stints. Exasperated,
he could only do something simpler.
Klein did not overexert himself since it would lead to fatigue and thus
put him in greater danger. He took an appropriate break and began
reading the original Klein’s notes and study material. He wished to
read anything regarding the Fourth Epoch again.
…
In the evening, Benson and Melissa sat in front of a desk. The food
was placed neatly like children in upper primary school.
The fragrances of the dishes were composed of a rich melody of
scents—the soul captivating fragrance of the stewed beef, the
obviously tender potatoes, the sweetness of the thick pea soup, the
mellow ﬂavors of the stewed rhubarb, and the sweetness of the
buttered rye bread.
Benson gulped a mouthful of saliva as he turned around to see Klein
placing a crispy ﬁsh onto a plate. He felt the fragrance of the oil
permeate through his nostrils into his throat and then into his
stomach.
Groan! His stomach made a distinct protest.
Klein rolled up his sleeves and held up a plate of fried ﬁsh before
placing it in the middle of the tidied desk. Following that, he
returned to the cupboard and took out two large cups of ginger beer
and placed them where he and Benson sat.
He smiled at Melissa and took out a lemon pudding as if he were
performing a magic trick. “We’ll have beer, while you’ll have this.”
“…Thank you.” Melissa took the lemon pudding.
When Benson saw this, he raised his calm and said with a smile,
“This is to celebrate Klein’s ﬁnding of a decent job.”
Klein raised his cup and clinked it with Benson before clinking it with
Melissa’s lemon pudding. “Praise the Lady!”
Gulp. He tilted his head back and drank it down. The spicy feeling
warmed his gullet, bringing him great aftertastes.
Despite its name, ginger beer did not contain any alcohol. It was a
mixture of the ginger’s spiciness and the sourness of lemon that made
it taste similar to beer. It was a kind of beverage that both women
and children found acceptable. However, Melissa did not like the
taste of it.
“Praise the Lady!” Benson drank a mouthful as well while Melissa
took a nibble of the lemon pudding. She chewed at it repeatedly
before swallowing it down unwillingly.
“Give it a try.” Klein put down his cup and picked up his fork and
spoon and pointed at the tableful of food.
He was most pessimistic of his thick pea soup. After all, he had never
eaten something so strange on Earth. All he could do was adapt the
recipe from the original Klein’s memory fragments.
As the eldest brother, Benson did not stand on ceremony as he dug up
a spoonful of mashed potatoes and stuﬀed it into his mouth.
The beaten potatoes were boiled thoroughly and mixed with the faint
taste of lard and just enough salt. It whetted his appetite and made
him salivate.
“Not… bad… Not bad,” praised Benson vaguely. “It’s much more
delicious than the one I had back at work. They only used butter.”
This is one of my specialties after all… Klein accepted the praise. “It’s
all thanks to the teachings of the chef at Welch’s place.”
Melissa looked at the beef soup. The green basil leaves, the green
lettuce heads, and the radishes were submerged in the colorless soup,
covering the tender beef. The soup was clear and its fragrance
tantalizing.
She forked a piece of beef and placed it in her mouth to chew. The
beef retained a little chewiness despite being stewed tender. The
mixture of salt, the sweetness from the radishes, and the spiciness
from the basil leaves complemented the deliciousness of the beef.
“…” She seemed to give her approbation, but she could not stop her
chewing.
Klein tasted it and felt that although it was delicious, it was not
without regret. This was still far from his usual standard. After all, he
was lacking in certain condiments and could only use replacements.
It was no wonder it tasted diﬀerent.
Of course, even with the best standards, one could only make do with
the dishes they cooked personally.
Suddenly, his heart pained for Benson and Melissa who were stunted
in their world view.
After swallowing a piece of beef, Klein picked up a piece of fried
Tussock Fish which was sprinkled with cumin and rosemary. It was
crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The char was a perfect
golden brown and the saltiness and oil fragrance intertwined as one.
Nodding slightly, Klein tried a piece of stewed rhubarb and found it
palatable. It got rid of the cloyed taste of meat.
Finally, he mustered his courage and scooped a bowl of thick pea
soup.
Too sweet and too sour… Klein could not help but frown.
However, after seeing Benson and Melissa looking satisﬁed from
tasting it, he began suspecting his tastes. He could not help but down
a mouthful of ginger beer to cleanse his tongue.
The siblings were stuﬀed by the end of the meal. They laid slumped
in the chairs for quite a while.
“Let us praise the Lady once more!” Benson raised his ginger beer—
which had only one mouthful left—as he said in satisfaction.
“Praise the Lady!” Klein downed the last bit of his beverage.
“Praise the Lady.” Melissa ﬁnally put the last bit of lemon pudding
into her mouth and enjoyed the ﬂavors swishing through her mouth.
When Klein saw this, he took advantage of his tipsiness and smiled.
“Melissa, that’s not right. You should eat the thing you ﬁnd most
delicious thing at the beginning. That way, you can fully appreciate
its most delicious aspects. Tasting it when you are ﬁlled and satiated
will not do the food justice.”
“No, it’s still as delicious as it can be,” answered Melissa ﬁrmly and
stubbornly.
The siblings had a happy chat, and after digesting their meals, they
cleaned up the plates, cutlery, and stored the oil which was used to
fry the ﬁsh.
After busying themselves, it was revision time. One refreshed his
accounting knowledge while another continued reading the study
material and notes. Time was spent to its fullest.
At eleven, the siblings extinguished the gas lamp and went to bed
after washing up.
…
Klein felt groggy as he stared at the darkness in front of him. A ﬁgure
wearing a black windbreaker and halved top hat appeared suddenly
in Klein’s vision. It was Dunn Smith.
“Captain!” Klein jolted awake and knew he was dreaming.
Dunn’s gray eyes remained calm, as though he was mentioning
something trivial. “Someone has sneaked into your room. Pick up
your revolver and force him to the corridor. Leave the rest to us.”
Someone has sneaked into my room? The observer has ﬁnally taken
action? Klein jumped in fright, but did not dare ask further. All he
did was nod and say, “Alright!”
The scene before his eyes changed immediately as a swath of colors
appeared like the bursting of bubbles.
Klein’s eyes opened as he carefully turned his head. He looked
toward the window and saw a thin but unfamiliar back standing at
his desk, rummaging for something in silence.
Chapter 28: Secret Order
Badump! Badump! Badump!
Klein’s heart began beating rapidly. It shrank into a clump before
expanding abruptly. It made his body tremble gently.
There was an instant when he nearly forgot what he had to do until
the lurking ﬁgure suddenly paused. The ﬁgure pricked his ears
slightly as though listening for any changes.
Blood ﬂowed back from his brain as Klein regained his basic
cognitive abilities. He reached beneath the pillow for the wooden
grip of the revolver.
He felt the ﬁrm but smooth feeling as he rapidly calmed down. He
silently and slowly pulled out the revolver and aimed it at the
trespasser’s head.
To be honest, he had no conﬁdence in striking the intruder. Although
he was already able to stably hit the target during practice, a moving
person and a ﬁxed target were completely diﬀerent. He was not
arrogant enough to confound the two together.
However, he vaguely remembered something from his previous life;
the general idea was that a nuclear weapon wielded the greatest
strength before its launch.
The principle held in his current situation. The best deterrence was
before he shot!
By not pulling the trigger or shooting blindly, the intruder was
unable to determine whether or not he was a complete rookie who
had an extremely high chance of missing him. His worries and fears
would make him deliberate more, resulting in him restraining
himself!
In an instant, another thought arose in him. It immediately made
Klein turn decisive. He was not the kind of person who turned calmer
when faced with danger; instead, he had already imagined the
situation when he faced the observer—using intimidation instead of
attacking.
The Foodaholic Empire had an idiom: Where there is precaution
there will be no danger!
When Klein pointed his gun at the intruder, the thin man froze
suddenly, as though he had sensed something.
Following that, he heard a voice that hid a chuckle.
“Good evening, Sir.”
The scrawny man clasped both his hands together, and his body
seemed to tense. Klein sat on the lower bunk, aimed the person’s
head with the revolver, and tried to speak as leisurely and as
naturally as he could.
“Please raise both of your hands and turn around. Try to do it slow.
To be frank, I am very timid and I get nervous easily. If you move too
quickly, I can be frightened, and I can’t guarantee that there won’t be
a situation where I misﬁre. Yes, that’s right.”
The scrawny man raised both of his hands and held them up near his
head before turning his body bit by bit. The ﬁrst thing that came into
view was a black tight suit with neat buttons. Next, he caught a pair
of brown eyebrows that were thick and sharp.
The intruder’s deep blue eyes didn’t reﬂect fear, but rather gazed
upon Klein with the intensity of a ferocious beast. It seemed that if
Klein were careless for a second, the other person would leap forward
and tear him to pieces.
He clenched the handle tightly as he tried his best to appear calm and
indiﬀerent.
It was only when the thin man faced him completely did Klein jerk
his chin towards the door. He softly and gently said, “Sir, let’s take
this outside. Do not disturb the beautiful dreams of others. Oh, do
keep your motions slow. Lighten your footsteps a little too. It’s basic
courtesy for a gentleman.”
The thin man’s cold pupils rolled as he swept Klein a glance. He
continued raising his hands as he walked slowly to the door.
Under the revolver’s aim, he twisted the handle and slowly opened
the door.
When the door was half-opened, he suddenly lowered himself and
rolled forward. The door was pulled by a strong wind and it closed
with a slam.
“Uh…” Benson, who was on the top bunk, was stirred. He almost
woke up in a daze.
At that moment, a leisurely and serene melody entered from outside.
The heavy and comfortable voice started to sing.
“Oh, the threat of horror, the hope of crimson cries!
“One thing at least is certain—that this Life ﬂies;
“One thing is certain, and the rest is Lies;
“The Flower that once has bloomed forever dies 1 …”
The poem seemed to possess the power to calm and relax others.
Benson, who was on the top bunk, and Melissa, who was in another
room, again fell asleep amid their grogginess.
Klein’s body and mind was also peaceful and quiet. He nearly
yawned.
The way the thin man had darted oﬀ was so agile that he could not
react in time.
Looking at the closed door, he smiled and muttered to himself. “You
might not believe it, but pulling the trigger would not release a
round.”
The empty chamber to prevent misﬁring!
Following that, Klein listened to the midnight poem as he patiently
awaited for the battle outside to end.
Within a minute, the tranquil melody which resembled the reﬂection
of moonlight on the surface of a lake stopped, and the dark night
resumed its deep silence.
Klein silently spun the cylinder and moved the empty chamber away
as he awaited for the outcome.
He uneasily waited for a full ten minutes. Just as he wondered if he
should investigate, he heard Dunn Smith’s staid and warm voice from
the door.
“It’s settled.”
Phew. Klein exhaled. He held his revolver and took his key.
Barefooted, he carefully approached the door before silently opening
it to see the black windbreaker and the halved top hat. Dunn Smith
was standing there with his deep and calm gray eyes.
He closed the door behind him and followed Dunn to the end of the
corridor and stood amid the weak crimson moonlight.
“It took me some time to enter his dream,” said Dunn calmly as he
looked at the red moon outside the window.
“Do you know his background?” Klein felt a lot more relieved.
Dunn nodded and said, “An ancient organization known as the Secret
Order. They were established in the Fourth Epoch and are related to
the Solomon Empire and a number of fallen aristocrats of that period.
Heh, the Antigonus family’s diary came from them. Due to a
member’s negligence, it entered the antique market and was obtained
by Welch. They had no choice but to send people in search of it.”
Without waiting for Klein’s question, he paused before continuing.
“We will capture the remaining members they have according to the
clues. Well, it might not end too well. These fellows are as good at
hiding as the rats in the sewers. But at the very least, they would
believe that we have likely obtained the Antigonus family’s notebook
or that we have obtained a critical clue. In that case, as long as it’s
not something extremely crucial or important, they would abandon
the operation. That is their philosophy on surviving.”
“…What if the notebook is extremely crucial and important?” asked
Klein worriedly.
Dunn smiled without an answer. Instead, he said, “We know very
little of the Secret Order. Our success this time is all thanks to your
sharp wits. This contribution is all yours. In light of the possibility of
hidden dangers and how heightened perception would aid in ﬁnding
the notebook, you have a chance at choosing.”
“A chance at choosing?” Klein vaguely guessed something as his
breathing subconsciously turned heavy.
Dunn wiped the smile from his face as he said in all seriousness, “Do
you wish to become a Beyonder? You can only choose the starting
Sequence of an incomplete Sequence.
“Of course, you can give up this chance and choose to accumulate the
merit you have garnered. Then, all you have to do is wait till there’s
suﬃcient room for you to become a Sleepless, which is also the ﬁrst,
complete Sequence the Goddess has bestowed on the Nighthawks.”
Indeed… Klein felt delighted and did not have any hesitant emotions.
He took the initiative to ask, “Then from which of the Sequence 9s
can I choose from?”
I have to have detailed information to decide whether to give up or accept,
as well as choose which one!
Dunn turned around and seemed to be cloaked in the crimson veil
that shone down on him. He looked into Klein’s eyes and said slowly,
“Apart from the Sleepless, the Church has three Sequence 9 potion
formulas. One of them is Mystery Pryer, which is also the power Old
Neil controls. Heh, Rozanne has likely mentioned this to you. She can
never hold her tongue.”
Klein smiled awkwardly, at a loss for an answer. Thankfully, Dunn
did not mind it as he continued. “Our Mystery Pryer potion formula
and the later Sequences that aren’t directly chained were obtained
from the Moses Ascetic Order. Back then, it was said that they had
yet to fall to corruption. They persisted in their morals and precepts,
determined in their pursuit of knowledge. They kept their secrets
strictly conﬁdential. Anyone that entered the order would be barred
from speaking for ﬁve years after becoming a Mystery Pryer. They
would learn to keep silent, so as to cultivate and enhance their focus.
The motto of Moses Ascetic Order—do as you wish, but do no harm
—began from them.
“Mystery Pryers have a comprehensive but rudimentary
understanding and grasp of magic, witchcraft, astrology, and other
mystical knowledge. They also know a fair number of magical rituals,
but they can easily sense certain existences that hide among matter.
Therefore, they have to be careful and show respect to their powers
as a Beyonder.
“We lack a large portion of this Sequence, causing it to be an
incomplete chain. For example, its Sequence 8. Of course, perhaps
the Holy Cathedral has it.”
This pretty much meets all my requirements… Klein nodded slightly,
to the point of having the urge to choose.
Thankfully, he still remembered certain things.
“What about the other two?”
“The second type is named Corpse Collector. Quite a number of
cultists who worship Death in the Southern Continent choose it. After
consuming the potion, unintelligent dead spirits would mistake them
as one of their kind and not attack them. They would gain resistance
to the cold, decay, and corrosiveness of cadaveric auras. They will be
able to directly see a portion of evil spirits and see the characteristics
and weaknesses of undead creatures, as well as gain certain attribute
enhancements. We have the Sequence 8 and Sequence 7 that follows
it. Heh heh, you probably can guess Sequence 7—Spirit Medium!
This was chosen by Daly back then,” described Dun in detail.
Spirit Medium does appear mysterious and cool, but what I want most is
to grasp knowledge of mysticism… Klein did not interject; all he did
was listen quietly.
Dunn Smith looked sideways at the crimson moon and said, “We only
have Sequence 9 of the third type. Whether the Holy Cathedral has it,
I’m not sure. It’s called Seer.”
Seer? Klein’s pupils constricted as he recalled the regret Emperor
Roselle had left in his diary: He regretted not choosing 2 an
Apprentice, Bandit, or Seer!
Chapter 29: "Jobs" and Rentals
Are Serious Business
Klein tried his best to remain his usual self as he asked with genuine
interest, “What abilities do Seers have?”
“Your question is inaccurate; the question should be, ‘what abilities
does consuming the Seer potion give?'” Dunn Smith shook his head
and chuckled. His gray pupils and face turned away from the moon
as his features hid in the shadows. “There are many kinds of things
involved—astromancy, cartomancy, spiritual pendulums, and scrying.
Of course, it does not mean that consuming the potion will
immediately allow you to grasp all of them. The potion only equips
you with the qualiﬁcations and ability to learn it.
“As they lack direct means of ﬁghting enemies, heh. You can
probably imagine that setting up a magical ritual requires a lot of
preparation. It’s not suitable for combat. Therefore, in terms of
knowledge of mysticism, a Seer will be more learned and professional
than a Mystery Pryer.”
It sounds like it matches my requirements as well… However, the lack of
means to directly deal with enemies is quite a dilemma… Furthermore, the
Church of the Evernight Goddess likely doesn’t have the subsequent
Sequences… The Holy Cathedral likely refers to the headquarters, the
Cathedral of Serenity… The means available to low-Sequence Beyonders
against their enemies might not be comparable to ﬁrearms… Klein fell
into deep thought as he racked his brains. He kept going back and
forth between Mystery Pryers and Seers. He no longer considered
Corpse Collector.
Dunn Smith smiled when he saw this.
“You don’t have to rush into a decision. Tell me your answer Monday
morning. Regardless of your choice of Sequence or giving up this
opportunity, none of us from the Nighthawks would have any other
thoughts on the matter.
“Calm down and ask your heart.”
With that said, he took oﬀ his hat and bowed slightly. He slowly
walked past Klein and headed for the stairwell.
Klein did not say a word and did not immediately reply. He silently
bowed and watched as Dunn left.
Although he was constantly hoping to become a Beyonder previously,
he was thrown into a dilemma when the opportunity arose; the
subsequent missing Sequences, Beyonders having the risk of losing
control, the believability of Emperor Roselle’s diaries, and the
illusory murmurs that could corrupt people into madness all mixed
together and formed a moat that obstructed his advancement.
He took a deep breath and slowly breathed out.
“No matter how bad it is, it can’t be worse than making an eighteen-
year-old high-school student decide on his future career…” Klein
gave a self-deprecating chuckle. Gathering his scattered thoughts, his
opened the door softly and laid back on the bed.
He laid there with his eyes open, silently looking at the bottom of the
top bunk that was dyed with the faint crimson of the moon.
A drunkard staggered outside the window as a carriage sped down
the empty streets. These noises did not break the serenity of the night
but instead made it even darker and more distant.
Klein’s emotions settled down as he recalled his past on Earth. He
recalled how he liked exercising, his father who always spoke loudly,
his mother who enjoyed busying herself despite having a chronic
disease, his friends who grew up with him, going from playing sports
like soccer and basketball to games and mahjong, as well as the
person he made a failed confession to… These were like a silent river;
it did not have many ripples or deep sentimental feelings, but it
silently drowned his heart.
Perhaps one will only learn to cherish things after they have lost
them. When the crimson receded and the sky turned golden-yellow
from the ﬂaming ball’s illumination, Klein had made his choice.
…
He got out of bed and headed to the public bathroom to wash his face
to wake himself up. Then, he took a one-soli note to Mrs. Wendy’s to
buy eight pounds of rye bread with nine pence, replenishing the
staple food that had been consumed the previous night.
“The price of bread has begun stabilizing…” He commented after
breakfast as Benson changed.
It was Sunday, so both he and Melissa ﬁnally had the chance to rest.
Klein, who was already in proper attire, was sitting on a chair and
ﬂipping through the outdated newspapers he brought back from
yesterday. He said in surprise, “There’s a house for rent here: North
Borough’s 3 Wendel Street, a bungalow with two ﬂoors. There are six
bedrooms, three bathrooms, and two big balconies upstairs.
Downstairs, there’s a dining hall, a living room, a kitchen, two
bathrooms, and two guest rooms, as well as an underground cellar…
In front of the house are two acres of private land and there’s a small
garden behind. It can be rented for one, two, or three years, with a
weekly rent of one pound six soli. Those interested can head to
Champagne Street and look for Mr. Gusev.”
“That’s our goal for the future.” Benson wore his black halved top hat
as he smiled to say, “The rent for the places in newspapers is usually
a little too expensive. The Tingen City Housing Improvement
Company has options that do not pale in comparison to that for
cheaper.”
“Why are we not searching in the Tingen Housing Improvement
Association for the Working Class?” Melissa walked out from her
room holding an old, veiled hat. She had changed into a grayish-
white long dress that had been mended several times.
She was silent and introverted, but that could not mask her
youthfulness.
Benson laughed.
“Where did you hear of the Tingen Housing Improvement Association
for the Working Class?” Jenny? Mrs. Rochelle? Or is it from your
good friend Selena?”
Melissa looked to the side and whispered a reply.
“Mrs. Rochelle… While washing up last night, I happened to meet
her. She asked me about Klein’s interview and I told her roughly
what happened. Then, she suggested I ﬁnd the Tingen Housing
Improvement Association for the Working Class.”
Benson noticed Klein’s puzzled expression and shook his head in
amusement.
“They are targeted at the poor. Well, a precise description is that they
are a housing association for the lower strata of society. They build
and renovate houses that basically have communal bathrooms. They
only provide three choices—a single, double or triple bedroom. Do
you wish to continue living in such an environment?
“The Tingen City Housing Improvement Company share similar
businesses as them, but they also provide choices for the lower-
middle class. To be honest, we are a little better than lower-middle
class, but we still quite worse oﬀ than true middle-class families. It’s
not a matter of salary; it’s just that we did not have the time to save
up.”
Klein came to a realization as he put away the newspaper. Picking up
his top hat, he stood up.
“Then, let’s set oﬀ.”
“I remember that the Tingen City Housing Improvement Company is
on Daﬀodil Street,” Benson said as he opened the door. “They are like
the Tingen Housing Improvement Association for the Working Class,
known as Five Percent Charities. Do you know why?”
“I don’t know.” Klein raised his cane and walked to Melissa’s side.
The girl with black hair that reached down her back nodded.
Benson headed out and said, “These kinds of housing improvement
associations or companies were established as a result of Backlund.
They are funded in three ways: One, by requesting donations from
charitable foundations. Two, through funding proposals. They receive
grants from the government’s commission at a special rate of 4%.
Third, through investments. By taking a portion of the rent received,
they will give their investors 5% returns. That’s why they are called
Five Percent Charities.”
The siblings went down the stairs and slowly walked toward Daﬀodil
Street. They decided to conﬁrm a place before talking to their present
landlord, Mr. Franky. They did not want to be in a situation where
they were forced to move when had no place to stay.
“I heard from Selena that there are housing improvement companies
that are purely run as charities?” Melissa asked in thought.
Benson chuckled.
“There are, such as the Deweyville Trust which Sir Deweyville
donated money to establish. He builds apartments targeted for the
working class. He also provides dedicated estate management
personnel while only charging rather low rent. However, the criteria
for applying is very strict.”
“It sounds like you aren’t fond of the idea?” Klein acutely sensed it as
he asked with a smile.
“No, I respect Sir Deweyville a lot, but I’m certain he does not know
what true poverty is. Staying in his apartment is like a priest giving
hope. It’s not very pragmatic. For instance, tenants have to receive
the main vaccines and they have to take turns cleaning the bathroom.
They are unable to sublease their apartments or use it for commercial
activities. They aren’t allowed to throw their rubbish wantonly and
children are prevented from playing in the corridors. Goddess, does
he wish to make everyone ladies and gentlemen?” Benson answered
in his usual tone.
Klein creased his brows in doubt.
“Doesn’t sound problematic. Those are all very reasonable criteria.”
“Yeah.” Melissa nodded in agreement.
Benson cocked his head and looked at them before chuckling.
“Perhaps I have protected the both of you too well that you have not
seen actual poverty. Do you think they would have the money for the
main vaccines? The line for free charitable organization sets them
back three months.
“Do you think their work is stable and not temporary? If they cannot
sublet parts of their apartment to receive some extra income, are they
to move out when they lose their jobs? Besides, many ladies mend
clothes or make match boxes at home to maintain their livelihood.
Those are included as commercial activities. Are you going to chase
them all out?
“Most of the poor use all their eﬀorts to survive. Do you think they
have the time to discipline their children and stop them from running
along the corridors? Perhaps they can only be locked at home until
they’re old enough, then sending them to places that accept child
labor when they are around seven or eight years old.”
Ben did not use many adjectives to describe the matter; it caused
Klein to shudder a little.
This was how people from low socioeconomic classes lived?
Beside him, Melissa fell into silence. It took a long while before she
said in an ethereal tone,
“Jenny no longer wished for me to visit her after she moved to the
Lower Street.”
“Let’s hope her father gets back on his feet after that injury and ﬁnds
a stable job. However, I have seen too many alcoholics use alcohol to
numb themselves…” Benson laughed with a somber tone.
Klein was at a loss for words. Melissa seemed to be the same. As
such, the siblings walked silently down Daﬀodil Street and found
Tingen City Housing Improvement Company.
The person who served them was a middle-aged man with an amiable
smile. He did not wear a formal attire or a hat, but instead, wore a
white shirt and black vest.
“You can call me Scarter. Might I know what kind of house you have
in mind?” When he caught a glance at Klein’s silver-inlaid cane, his
smile widened.
Klein looked at Benson, who was better with words, and gestured for
him to answer.
Benson directly answered, “A terrace house.”
Scarter ﬂipped through the ﬁles and documents in his hand before
smiling.
“There are currently ﬁve that haven’t been rented out. To be honest,
we are geared more to serving customers—laborers and their children
who have housing diﬃculties where six, eight, or even ten or twelve
people squeeze into a house. There aren’t many terrace houses.
There’s one at 2 Daﬀodil Street, one in the North Borough, one in the
East Borough… The weekly rent goes from 12 to 16 soli. You can
take a look at the detailed introductions here.”
He handed over a document to Benson, Klein, and Melissa.
After reading through it, the siblings exchanged looks and pointed to
the same spot on the piece of paper simultaneously.
“Let’s take a look at 2 Daﬀodil Street ﬁrst,” said Benson. Klein and
Melissa nodded in response.
This place was a district they were familiar with.
Chapter 30: Brand New
Beginning
2, 4, and 6 Daﬀodil Street were terrace buildings with multifaceted
hipped roofs. Their exteriors were painted grayish blue, and three
chimneys stood erected.
The place obviously did not have lawns, gardens, or porches. The
entrances directly faced the street.
Tingen City Housing Improvement Company’s Scarter took out a
bunch of keys and while opening the door, introduced, “Our terrace
houses do not have foyers, so you enter directly into the living room.
There’s an oriel window facing Daﬀodil Street, so there’s pretty good
lighting…”
Klein, Benson, and Melissa were greeted by a fabric sofa bathing in
the golden rays of the sun, and an area more spacious than their
previous two-bedroom apartment.
“This living room can be used as a guest hall. To its right is the
dining room and on the left is a ﬁreplace that will keep you warm in
winter.” Scarter pointed around with great familiarity.
Klein looked around and conﬁrmed that it was a crude, open-style
concept. The dining room and the living room were not separated by
any partitions, but they were also far from the oriel window, making
those spots rather dim.
There was a rectangular red wooden table surrounded by six
hardwood chairs with soft cushions. The ﬁreplace on the left wall
looked exactly like the ones in foreign movies and TV series that
Klein used to watch.
“Behind the dining area is the kitchen, but we do not provide any
appliances. Opposite to the living room is a small guest room and a
bathroom…” Scarter walked around and described the remaining
layout of the house.
The bathroom was separated into two parts. The outer area was
where one would wash their face and brush their teeth, while the
inner area was the toilet. There was an accordion door that separated
them. The guest room was described to be small, but it was as big as
the room that Melissa currently stayed in. She was stunned at the
sight.
After looking around the ﬁrst ﬂoor, Scarter brought the three siblings
to the stairway next to the bathroom.
“Down below is the underground cellar. It is quite stuﬀy downstairs,
so you must remember to let some fresh air in ﬁrst before entering.”
Benson nodded casually and followed Scarter to the second ﬂoor.
“On my left, there’s a bathroom. On the same side, there are an
additional two bedrooms. It’s the same layout on my right, but the
washroom on this side is next to the balcony.”
As he spoke, Scarter opened the bathroom door and stood sideways
so that he would not obstruct Klein, Benson, and Melissa from
looking in.
The bathroom had an extra bathtub. Like the other bathroom, there
was an accordion door next to the toilet. Although it was a little
dusty, it wasn’t dirty, smelly, or cramped.
Melissa looked in a daze until Scarter walked to the bedroom next to
it. Only then did she stop looking and follow the rest slowly.
She took another few steps before looking back.
Klein, who was experienced in life, was delighted and excited as well.
Even though their landlord often supervised their cleaning up of the
bathroom, it still was not clean enough. It was often nauseating, let
alone the fact that they would easily encounter a line when they
needed to relieve their urgencies.
The other bathroom was similar. One of the four bedrooms was
slightly bigger and was furnished with a bookcase. The rest were
about the same size as each other and had a bed, table, and
wardrobe.
“The balcony is very tiny, so you won’t be able to dry too many
clothes in the sun at a time.” Scarter stood at the end of the corridor
and pointed to a spot with a door and lock. “There is a complete
underground drainage, gas piping, meter, and other facilities. It is
very suitable for you gentlemen and a lady like yourselves. It only
requires thirteen soli of rent and ﬁve pence for use of the furniture
weekly. In addition, there is a deposit that amounts to four weeks of
rent.”
Without waiting for Benson to say a word, Klein looked around and
asked curiously, “Roughly how much would it cost to buy the
house?”
As a transmigrator from the Foodaholic Empire, the desire to buy
property still existed within him.
Upon hearing that question, Benson and Melissa were shocked. They
looked at Klein as though they were seeing a monster. Scarter replied
calmly and ﬁrmly, “Buy? No, we do not sell property. We only
provide rental properties.”
“I’m just trying to have a general sense of the prices.” Klein explained
awkwardly.
Scarter hesitated for a few seconds before saying, “Last month, the
owner of 11 Daﬀodil Street sold a limited-period land deed with a
similar property sitting atop the land. 300 pounds for ﬁfteen years. It
is much cheaper than renting directly but not everyone can fork out
such a large sum of money. If one would like to buy it over
completely, the owner’s posted price 850 pounds.”
850 pounds? Klein quickly made the mental calculations.
My weekly pay is three pounds, Benson eans one pound and ten soli…
Rent is thirteen soli and if we eat well every day, we would spend nearly
two pounds a week. On top of that, there are expenses such as clothes,
transportation, social expenditures, so on and so forth. We can only save
less than twenty soli a week. One year adds up to about 35 pounds. 850
pounds would require more than twenty years. Even if it we bought the
land for a limited period of time for 300 pounds, it would take us at least
eight or nine years… That doesn’t include getting married, living
independently, raising children, traveling, and so on…
In a world without individual housing loans, most people are likely to opt
for rental…
Realizing this, he stepped back and stole a glance at Benson. He
beckoned him to talk to Scarter about the rent.
As for Melissa’s intentions, they were obvious from her bright eyes!
At that moment, Klein suddenly thought of letting Benson loose.
Benson tapped his plain cane and looked around before he said, “We
should take a look at other houses. The dining area’s lighting isn’t
good, and the balcony is very small. Look, only that bedroom has a
ﬁreplace, and the furniture is too old. If we move in, we have to at
least change half of these…”
He pointed out faults in a hurried tone, spending ten minutes to
persuade Scarter to lower the rent to twelve soli and the furniture
usage fee to three pence, while rounding up the deposit to two
pounds.
Without further ado, the siblings returned with Scarter to the Tingen
City Housing Improvement Company and signed two copies of the
contract. They then headed over to the Notary Oﬃce of Tingen City
to notarize the contract.
After paying the deposit and ﬁrst week’s rent, Klein and Benson’s
remaining money added up to nine pounds, two soli, and eight pence.
Standing before the door of 2 Daﬀodil Street, they each held a bunch
of copper keys. They were momentarily unable to look away; their
emotions churning within them.
“It feels like a dream…” After a while, Melissa lifted her head to look
at the future “Moretti Residence,” and she spoke with a low yet
unsteady voice.
Benson let out a breath and smiled.
“Then don’t wake up.”
Klein wasn’t as emotional as they were. He nodded and said, “We
need to change the locks of the main door and balcony door as soon
as possible.”
“There’s no hurry. The reputation of Tingen City Housing
Improvement Company is very good. The rest of the money is for
your formal suit. However, before that, we need to pay Mr. Franky a
visit.” Benson pointed in the direction of the apartment.
…
The siblings made do with rye bread at home before heading for a
terrace apartment on Iron Cross Street. When they knocked on their
landlord’s door, Mr. Franky declared imposingly while his short
frame perched on a sofa, “You know my rules. No one is allowed to
be behind their rent!”
Benson leaned forward and smiled.
“Mr. Franky, we are here to give up our lease.”
That straightforward? Would negotiating this way work? Standing beside
Benson, Klein was shocked when he heard him.
On the way here, Benson had said that his bottomline was a
compensation of twelve soli.
“Give up your lease? No! We have a contract, and there’s still half a
year left!” Franky glared at Benson as he ﬂailed his arms.
Benson looked at him seriously and waited for a moment before
saying calmly, “Mr. Franky, you should understand that you could
have made much more money.”
“Make much more?” Franky asked with interest, touching his skinny
face.
Benson sat up straight and explained with a smile, “The two-bedroom
unit was rented to the three of us for ﬁve soli and six pence. But if
you were to rent it to a family of ﬁve or six people, with two or three
of them working and getting paid, I think they would be willing to
pay more to stay there instead of staying at Lower Street where its
ridden with crime. I think ﬁve soli ten pence or six soli would be a
reasonable price.”
Franky’s eyes brightened up and his throat moved as Benson
continued to say, “Besides, you are certainly aware that rental prices
have been increasing in recent years. The longer we stay, the greater
a loss you incur.”
“But… I need time to look for a new tenant.” Mr. Franky, who had
inherited the apartment building, obviously liked the idea.
“I believe you can ﬁnd one very quickly since you have the ability
and resources to do so. Maybe two days, maybe three days… We will
pay for the losses you incur during this time. How about the deposit
of three soli that we have paid? It is very reasonable!” Benson
immediately decided for Franky.
Franky nodded in satisfaction.
“Benson, you are such a conscientious and honest young man. Alright
then, let’s sign the termination of contract.”
Klein was dumbfounded watching this happen. He completely
understood how easy it was to ‘convince’ Mr. Franky.
That’s way too easy…
With the problem of the previous contract resolved, the three siblings
ﬁrst helped Klein buy his formal wear and then got busy with moving
house.
They didn’t have anything heavy or bulky as bulkier items belonged
to the landlord. Thus, Benson and Melissa rejected Klein’s idea of
hiring a carriage, and instead carried their things themselves. They
went back and forth between Daﬀodil Street and Iron Cross Street.
The hot sun outside the window set in the west, and golden rays
shone through the oriel window, scattering across the desk’s surface.
Klein looked at the rack that had books and notebooks arranged
neatly before putting an ink bottle and a fountain pen on the table
which he had wiped cleaned earlier.
It’s ﬁnally over… He let out a breath of relief and heard his stomach
growl. He loosened his rolled up sleeves as he walked towards the
door.
He had a bed that belonged to him. The bedsheet and blanket were
white, old but clean.
Klein twisted the doorknob and walked out of his bedroom. Just as
he was preparing to say something, he saw both doors on the
opposite side open simultaneously as Benson and Melissa came into
his view.
Looking at the dust and dirt marks on their faces, Klein and Benson
suddenly burst out into laughter, sounding abnormally cheerful.
Melissa bit her lips lightly but the laughter was contagious. She
eventually let out a soft laugh.
…
The next morning.
Klein stood before a full-length mirror with no cracks, seriously
smoothing out his collar and sleeves of his shirt.
The outﬁt included a white shirt, black tuxedo, silk top hat, black
vest, a set of trousers, boots, and a bow tie. He felt the pinch of
paying eight pounds in total.
However, the eﬀect was great. Klein felt that his reﬂection in the
mirror exhibited greater scholarly qualities and made him look more
handsome.
Click!
He closed his pocket watch and put it into his inner pocket. He then
took his cane and hid his revolver. He took the tracked public
carriage and arrived at Zouteland Street.
The moment he entered the Blackthorn Security Company, he
realized that he was so used to his previous lifestyle that he had
forgotten to give Melissa extra money but allowed her to walk to
school instead.
Shaking his head, he took note of it before stepping into Blackthorn
Security Company. He saw the brown-haired girl, Rozanne, making
coﬀee. A rich aroma permeated throughout the oﬃce.
“Good morning, Klein. The weather is great today,” Rozanne greeted
him with a smile. “To be frank, I have always been curious. In such
weather, don’t you men feel hot wearing those formal suits? I know
for a fact that Tingen’s summer isn’t as hot as the South’s, but it is
still summer.”
“It’s the price of style,” Klein replied humorously. “Good morning,
Miss Rozanne. Where’s the Captain?”
“Same old place.” Rozanne pointed inside.
Klein nodded. He went through the partition and knocked on Dunn
Smith’s oﬃce door.
“Come in.” Dunn’s voice was deep and gentle as usual.
When he saw Klein, who looked quite diﬀerent in a set of nice formal
wear, he nodded and his gray eyes smiled.
“Have you decided?” he asked.
Klein took a deep breath and answered seriously, “Yes, I have made a
decision.”
Dunn slowly sat up straight. His expression became solemn but the
deep recesses of his gray eyes remained the same.
“Tell me your answer.”
Klein replied without hesitation, “Seer!”
Chapter 31: Potion
Dunn Smith stared at Klein with his gray eyes for a full minute
without a word.
Klein did not cower under the pressure of the silence and his gaze. He
continued locking his eyes with Dunn.
“You must understand that once you consume the potion, there will
be no room for regret.” Finally, Dunn spoke again in a deep
emotionless voice.
Klein grinned and said, “I know, but I respect the voice in me.”
First, Sleepless does not meet my requirements. It was the same for
Spectator which he heard from the Tarot Club based on description.
He was unsure when he would come into contact with other
Beyonder pathways. A slow remedy could not work for an urgent
situation; therefore, there was no need for him to wait. By the same
logic, Corpse Collector was eliminated as well, leaving the two
choices—Mystery Pryer and Seer.
Under the premise that potions of the same Sequence were equally
dangerous and him unable to obtain more information, as well as the
fact that both Mystery Pryer and Seer met his requirements, then
regardless of whether Emperor Roselle was making a passing remark
or if he really regretted not choosing Apprentice, Marauder, and Seer,
it was enough to tip the balance in his heart.
Furthermore, he could tell from the diary that as long as he ﬁgured
out the true essence of digestion and acting, he would be able to
avoid the negative eﬀects the potion would bring to a signiﬁcant
extent. As for the murmurings and illusory enticements that could
drive people to corruption and madness, he had already encountered
that even without being a Beyonder!
“Alright.” Dunn stood up and picked up his halved top hat. As he put
it on, he said, “Follow me down.”
Klein nodded and gave a gentleman’s bow in gratitude.
Tap. Tap. Tap. Both of them ventured down, their footsteps echoing
through the silent and vast stairwell and passageway.
Klein suddenly felt gripped by anxiety as he tried to ﬁnd a topic of
conversation.
“Captain, you mentioned that taking the potion would not directly
give me the corresponding knowledge on mysticism, that I’ll only
have the qualiﬁcations to learn it. Then, where does the basic
knowledge of mysticism come from? Did our predecessors risk their
life for it or obtain it via other means?”
Every time he went underground, he would ﬁnd the air especially
fresh. Clearly, the ventilation was excellent. However, the occasional
gust of wind made one shiver.
Dunn glanced at him, the darkness in his gray eyes appearing
abnormally deep.
He answered calmly, “One of them is as you said, experimentation,
summarization, and enhancement. Second, being bestowed by the
gods. Third, heh. The dangerous murmurs that others can’t hear do
not only growl and roar senselessly. At times, they will describe some
matters regarding mysticism. But according to what I know, people
who truly listen to the murmurs on a long-term basis have gone mad
without exception. Or they would fall to corruption and become
monsters. Of course, we must thank them. The notebooks they’ve left
behind are precious treasures in the ﬁeld of mysticism.”
Human lab rats? The underground passage’s cold humidity made
Klein shudder suddenly.
Then, would my luck enhancement ritual which turned into “Social
Network Magic” eventually lead to similar eﬀects due to the crazy
and horrible murmurs?
At the intersection, Dunn did not proceed toward Chanis Gate, nor
did he turn to the weapons, materials and archives. Instead, he took
Klein to the left and approached Saint Selena Cathedral.
Midway, he stopped. It was unclear what he touched to open a secret
door.
“This is our Nighthawk team’s alchemy room. I will get Old Neil to
retrieve the Seer potion formula and the corresponding materials
from inside Chanis Gate. Heh, you have pretty good luck. The
Goddess has blessed you with her favor. We should still have the
materials needed for two Seer potions. If not, you would have to wait
a long while.” Dunn pointed at the room behind the door. “Wait in
here. Later, watch Old Neil concoct the potion. It’s the most basic
part of mysticism studies. Oh, do not randomly touch things in there.
They are either very dangerous, expensive, or both.”
With that said, Dunn added like before.
“Oh right, I forgot something again. Your becoming a Beyonder is a
result of you having to face danger and the need to ﬁnd the
notebook. The meritorious deed was only a part of it; therefore, you
will not be a member of our team for the time being. You will still be
a civilian staﬀ member with a corresponding salary. You will still do
what I instructed you to do previously. One additional thing is to
learn more about mysticism with Old Neil. You can arrange the time
with him.”
“Alright.” Other than feeling a little disgruntled by the lack of a pay
rise, Klein was in full agreement with the rest.
According to Dunn, there was still the process of learning and
grasping one’s newfound powers after consuming the potion. If he
were to become a formal member immediately and participate in
paranormal missions, his death was certain.
Dunn turned around and walked two steps towards the intersection
when he suddenly turned back.
“Another thing.”
I knew it… Klein was already used to the “style” of his Captain.
“We got something out of the Secret Order’s actions,” said Dunn with
his usual expression. “It’s unlikely they will provoke you in the near
future, but don’t be careless. It has to do with them being temporarily
unable to conﬁrm whether the Antigonus family’s notebook is
important to them. From what we discovered, they have preserved
some of the ancient customs and we can conﬁrm that they are related
to the Solomon Empire and the corrupted nobles of that period.”
“Got it. Thanks, Captain,” said Klein as he exhaled.
This was also one of the reasons why he did not wish to wait,
grasping the chance of becoming a Beyonder in such a hurry!
As he watched Dunn leave and conﬁrmed that he would not turn his
head to say more, Klein slowly walked into the alchemy room.
The room had long tables. There were test tubes, pipettes, scales and
crucibles. It resembled a chemistry laboratory from his previous life.
It was just more spartan and ancient.
Other than that, there was a huge cauldron, a dark wood ladle, a
translucent crystal ball, and other items. The Dark Sacred Emblem
and other strange emblems were visible everywhere. They gave the
room a tint of mystery.
Klein looked around with interest, but he was not stupid enough to
touch the things.
After a while, he heard footsteps. Old Neil carried a tiny silver chest
with complicated patterns. He was still wearing his unique classic
black robe that seem anachronistic, matched with a felt hat with a
rounded edge of the same color.
“Lad, I never expected you to choose Seer.” Old Neil put down the
chest and used his somewhat turbid red eyes size up Klein. “Your
personality is just like mine when I was young. You just don’t want to
follow the masses. Not bad. Light these few gas lamps and close the
door.”
“Alright.” Klein tried hard not to tremble as he lit each gas lamp in
the alchemy room. He made dim light rule over the place once again.
Tak! Tak! Tak! The secret door was closed. He turned back to see the
white-haired
and deep-wrinkled Old Neil using a bunch of strange tied tree
branches to scrub
the black cauldron.
“The concoction of a Sequence potion is extremely simple, at least for
Sequence 7 and below. There’s no need for a special ﬂame or any
additional ritual, much less an incantation. There’s no need for one to
participate in it spiritually. All one needs to do is go according to the
formula’s steps, add the precise amounts, and mix it. That will be
all.” Old Neil’s wrinkles seemed to bloom from his smile.
“For real?” Klein questioned in surprise.
This sounds as simple as my luck enhancement ritual…
Man, it’s quite frightening when you come to think of it…
“Perhaps it’s a gift of the gods. Praise the Lady.” Old Neil drew a
haphazard circle over his chest.
Following that, he opened the silver chest and pulled out goatskin
parchment that exuded antiquity.
The yellowish-brown goatskin unfurled inch by inch, revealing words
on it. Klein looked from a distance and realized it was in Hermes, a
language he was very familiar with.
It was written in ink that resembled blood, seeming to still having its
ﬂuidity intact. But other than that, it did not seem extraordinary in
any way.
“Seer: 100 milliliters of pure water, 13 drops of night vanilla liquids,
7 gold mint leaves…” Klein silently recited the formula’s content, but
the rest of it was blocked by Old Neil’s wrist, preventing him from
reading it.
“Pure water is water that is repeatedly distilled. Thankfully, I made
some previously, so there’s no need to waste time on it.” While Old
Neil gave the introduction, he took a large sealed glass bottle from
the table with great familiarity.
He took oﬀ the stopper and poured about 100 milliliters of pure
water into the cauldron without much thought.
Klein did not dare ask, afraid he would aﬀect Old Neil’s concoction.
After all, he was the one drinking the potion.
“13 drops of night vanilla juices. This can be extracted and stored as
an essential oil ahead of time.” Old Neil took out a tiny brown bottle
from the silver chest and with a pipette and dripped 13 drops into the
cauldron in a relaxed manner.
A faint but easing fragrance emanated, making Klein feel an
abnormal sense of peace.
“7 gold mint leaves…” Old Neil picked up a silver patterned can and
removed its lid. With his bare hands, he picked up a few leaves and
scattered it into the cauldron. He caught a whiﬀ of a fresh and
stimulating scent.
“4, 5, 6, 7. Perfect.” Old Neil chuckled and looked at the potion
formula on the goatskin. “3 drops of poison hemlock. This isn’t
something you should drink randomly. It can cause your entire body
to numb to the point of death. In ancient times, it proved to be the
best option for committing suicide.”
It’s not like I’m silly… Klein lampooned.
Old Neil changed pipettes and dripped the poison hemlock into the
cauldron. The mixture caused a strange smell that freshened one’s
mind.
“9 grams of dragon blood grass powder.” Old Neil took his time to
reach his hand into the silver chest and pulled out a transparent test
tube. There was some deep black powder inside.
He used a beaker and a scale to measure 9 grams of powder and
poured it into the cauldron. He then stirred the mixture twice with
the dark wood ladle. The laidback process to making the concoction
made Klein a little worried.
“In fact, the materials from before were just supplemental. The exact
amount doesn’t really aﬀect the ﬁnal outcome. Should I put a little
bit more?” Old Neil made a joke. “The last two is what’s crucial. The
amount can be slightly lowered, but it cannot be too far from the
requirement, or your ‘enhancement’ can fail. Oh, the quantity cannot
be any more, even just by a bit. If so, you will have to be treated for
mental problems. It’s not impossible to die immediately.”
Klein immediately tensed up as he saw Old Neil pull out a black glass
bottle from the silver chest.
“Lavos Squid’s blood, 10 milliliters. This kind of squid is considered
an extraordinary biological species. It is clearly mutated. It is covered
in mystery. Its blood will rapidly break down under sunlight and lose
its unique qualities. It has to be stored in opaque material.” Old Neil’s
tone no longer sounded relaxed. He quickly and carefully retrieved
10 milliliters of blood with a test tube.
The blood was blue like the sky. From time to time, it produced
illusory bubbles as though it was connected to the spiritual world.
“After pouring the blood inside the test tube, the remaining drops are
ignored as a form of precaution,” whispered Old Neil.
The moment the blue blood entered the cauldron and made contact
with the liquid from before, it produced bubbling sounds. The
surrounding light was dyed with a light blue tinge, making Klein feel
a strange sense of distance but also familiarity.
It felt like the feeling of being in a mother’s womb. It elevated a
human’s soul.
“The ﬁnal item. Stellar Aqua crystal. 50 grams.” Old Neil’s voice
sounded in Klein’s ears, jolting him awake as he looked at the table.
In the old gentleman’s hand was a piece of extremely pure crystal.
Furthermore, the crystal appeared gelatinous, as though it was jelly
from Earth. It lacked hardness.
Under the blue light’s illumination, it reﬂected bits of light as it
seemed to contain a resplendent void of stars within.
“This is excellent material for the creation of divination crystals…
Just a little less in consideration of any mistakes.” As Old Neil
measured, he used a tiny patterned silver blade to extract the crystal.
“Pure water, night vanilla, gold mint leaves, poison hemlock juice,
dragon blood grass, Lavos Squid blood, and Stellar Aqua crystal make
up a Seer…” At that moment, Klein could not help but recall the
formula.
With everything done, Old Neil poured in a few blocks of Stellar
Aqua crystal into the cauldron.
Sizzle!
Illusory fog instantly spewed forth, turning the alchemy room into a
blur.
Klein seemed to see a vast array of stars amid the fog and felt like he
was being observed by an invisible existence.
A few seconds later, the fog dissipated. Old Neil used the dark wood
ladle and scooped out some sticky dark-blue liquid. It had strange
characteristics—gooey and inseparable. Not one bit was left in the
black cauldron.
The dark-blue liquid was poured into an opaque cup before Old Neil
pointed at it.
“It’s done, your Seer potion.”
Chapter 32: Spirit Vision
Klein looked at dark-blue gelatinous liquid, ﬁnding it hard to describe
it as either a block or cup of liquid. He swallowed his saliva and said
in great diﬃculty, “Am I to drink it just like that?
“Is there no need for any other preparations? Like a ritual, an
incantation, or a prayer?”
Old Neil acknowledged tersely before saying, “Preparation? There is.
Get a cup of Intis Aurmir grape wine, suck on a Desi cigar, then
whistle a relaxing tune, and dance a upbeat court dance. You can do
a tap dance if you prefer that. Finally, play a round of Gwent
cards…”
When he saw Klein’s expression turn dumbfounded, Old Neil laughed
and summarized what he had just said.
“If you feel nervous.”
…You are quite humorous, aren’t you…? The corners of Klein’s
mouth twitched as he resisted the urge to draw his gun.
He put his cane down and extended his right hand. As though he held
something heavy, he raised the opaque cup. The smell of the potion
was faint and seemingly ethereal.
“Lad, do not hesitate. The more you hesitate, the more nervous and
afraid you will be. That will only aﬀect the absorption that follows,”
said Old Neil with his back facing Klein. It was as though he had said
it casually.
It was unknown when he arrived by the nearby water basin. He
turned on the tap and washed his hands.
Klein nodded silently and took a deep breath. Just like he was back
when he was a child, he pinched his nose and drank it like medicine.
He moved the opaque cup to his mouth and tipped his head, drinking
it down with a gulp.
A cool and smooth feeling quickly ﬁlled his oral cavity. It then
ﬂowed through his gullet and into his stomach.
The sticky, dark-blue liquid seemed to grow out thin and long
tentacles, bringing stimulation and coldness to every cell in Klein’s
body.
He could not help but convulse as his vision rapidly went into a blur.
All colors seemed to saturate. The reds were redder, the blues were
bluer, and the blacks were blacker. The rich colors blended like an
impressionist painting.
Klein had seen such a scene before. It was back when he was
questioned by the Spirit Medium, Daly.
At that moment, his vision became a blur and although his mind felt
light, it was clear. He felt like a castaway ﬂoating in the sea.
Slowly, his surroundings turned discernible. All the colors returned to
their original as a grayish and blurry fog emanated.
Around him were bodies he found diﬃcult to describe. There were
transparent objects that did not seem to exist. Deep down, there were
clean light clusters of diﬀerent colors. The light seemed to possess life
or contain immense knowledge.
This is a little similar to what I saw during the luck enhancement
ritual… As Klein instinctively looked down, he realized that ‘he’ was
still standing in his original spot, body convulsing.
Suddenly, he came to a realization, causing his consciousness to sink
abruptly and fuse with him.
Boom!
The fog quickly dissipated as the colors restored to normal. The
bright, clear halo and the inexistent objects instantly vanished.
The scene in the alchemy room returned to normal, but Klein felt his
head swell. He felt like it was being yanked apart. Whatever he saw
had countless afterimages. His ears were overwhelmed by an ethereal
murmur.
“Hornacis… Flegrea… Hornacis… Flegrea… Hornacis… Flegrea…”
Klein felt a stabbing pain at his forehead as he quickly had thoughts
of causing destruction to vent the discomfort in him.
He frowned and hurriedly shook his head.
“Is your vision abnormal? Are you also hearing things you did not
use to hear?” said Old Neil, at his side with a concealed smile.
“Yes, Mr. Neil, what should I do?” Klein tolerated the intense mania
and asked.
Old Neil chuckled.
“This is the resulting seepage of the potion’s energy. You lack the
means to control it. Alright, do as I say. Think of an object in your
mind, something common. Make it simple and easy.”
Klein quickly focused as he envisaged his own halved top hat woven
from black silk. He recalled the feeling when he touched it and its
exact shape.
“Place all your focus on it. Keep repeating that while creating the
outlines. Does it feel a little better?” Old Neil’s voice penetrated into
his mind like a serene song.
Klein turned his focus bit by bit to the imagined top hat. He felt the
murmurs subside into a whisper before they vanished. The
afterimages he saw also stacked upon one another and no longer
appeared a blur.
“Much better,” said Klein after calming his mind of chaotic emotions
and having exhaled.
He looked down at his body and discovered that nothing abnormal
had happened.
He moved his limbs and with half-anticipation and half-doubt,
asking, “I succeeded? I’m now considered a Seer?”
Old Neil pulled out a mirror-like mercury plate and shoved it in front
of him.
“Look at your eyes.”
Klein focused his gaze and saw that he was wearing a black top hat.
His outline stood out and his facial features looked normal. Apart
from having his face covered in sweat, he did not seem diﬀerent in
any way.
He followed Old Neil’s instruction and carefully looked at his eyes.
Only then did he discover that his brown eyes had deepened quite
signiﬁcantly. It was so much deepened that it was like the night—one
in complete darkness. It felt so deep that it could absorb the souls of
others.
Normally, dark brown pupils are easily recognized as black. Without
looking very carefully, even Klein himself would not have noticed.
“This is a physical manifestation of the potion’s powers. When you
learn Cogitation and how to converge your power, your eyes will
return to normal.” Old Neil smiled as he reached out his right hand.
“Congratulations, our new Beyonder, our Seer.”
“Thank you.” Klein reached out his hand and shook it. “Mr. Neil,
when can I learn how to Cogitate?”
“You can learn it now. The initial steps of Cogitation is relatively
simple. It’s even more so for Beyonders,” said Old Neil with a smile.
“Just now, producing an object in your mind to divert your attention
and turning the energy seepage inwards is actually the ﬁrst step to
Cogitation. Try doing it again.”
Klein closed his eyes and once again, his mind depicted the halved
top hat.
His concentration seemed to be more easily focused than before.
Soon, random thoughts that surfaced would quickly vanish, leaving
the hat’s outline.
“Let your brain go somewhat blank. Exchange the object you
imagined. Use something that does not exist in this world, an object
you imagine completely out of thin air.”
“You have to follow this rule. Only by doing so can you enter
Cogitation, only then can you exceed the concept of ‘I.’ The limitless
‘I’ will be become one with the universe, giving you the ability to see
and understand the truth. You will obtain knowledge only you
yourself can understand. In the domain of mysticism studies, it’s
called a Mystic Experience,” said Old Neil using a pacifying tone.
“You just need to listen to the descriptions that I’ll get to later.
What’s most important is to enter Cogitation.”
Something that doesn’t exist in this world. Imagine something
completely out of thin air… Would things from Earth count? Klein
attempted using an earthy-green intercontinental missile he saw on
television. He replaced the halved top hat with this long and thick
missile.
However, regardless of how he outlined it or imagined it, he
ultimately only ended up focusing his attention.
It doesn’t seem like it will work… Klein had no choice but to let his
imagination run wild. He
outlined a sphere of light and then many similar objects, gathering
them together.
The spheres of light stacked upon one another. It felt like an object of
fantasy. Klein’s thoughts gradually turned ethereal and aﬂoat.
His body and mind calmed down. The objects that did not seem to
exist, the fog with the bright clusters of light, and the complex colors
appeared once again. They ﬂoated in the sky in close reach.
He extended his spirituality inch by inch as he looked down at them
quietly. He sensed it and took it in.
“Very good. As expected of a Seer. You entered Cogitation very
smoothly. You are just slightly worse than me back then. Slightly,”
said Old Neil with a chuckle. “In that case, I’ll begin teaching you the
most common, easiest to grasp, and most useful ability in the future
in mysticism. Spirit Vision!”
He switched oﬀ the gas lamps one after another but opened the door
to the alchemy room. It made the spot where Klein was dark, but not
to the point of failing to make out silhouettes of objects.
“Alright. in your present state, raise your hands and place them in
front of your eyes. Your index ﬁngers need to face each other, but
they are not to touch.
“Open your eyes and keep them open until you are accustomed to the
darkness.”
Klein completed each step according to Old Neil’s description. He saw
the silhouettes of his ﬁngers and the surrounding objects.
“Actually, you should be lying down to let your body be entirely
relaxed. But since the eﬀect of your Cogitation is not bad, let’s
continue.” Old Neil laughed. “Focus your gaze on a spot behind your
hands. It has to be behind. Then, slowly move your ﬁngers and
maintain the same pose without touching them. Also, do not pull
them out of your sight.”
Klein calmly listened to it and cast his gaze at an empty spot behind
his palms. He then slowly moved his index ﬁngers within his vision.
Once, twice, thrice… Suddenly, Klein saw a ﬁery-red color in
between his ﬁngers.
“Eh…” He let out a sound.
“You see color? That’s right. That’s the initial step to Spirit Vision.
The color you see is your aura,” said Old Neil with a chuckle. “No
rush. Do it a few more times. After stabilizing it, look elsewhere. I’ll
also take this opportunity to explain to you the diﬀerent meanings of
the diﬀerent colors.”
“Alright.” Klein moved his ﬁngers back and forth while having his
vision trained on the ﬁery-red.
Old Neil thought for a moment before saying, “To put it simply, the
mainstream way of mysticism is to split non-physical parts of a
human into four levels. At its core is the Spirit Body, which is also
everyone’s basic spirituality. There is a school of thought that
believes all biological creatures have spirituality and have a Spirit
Body.
“I’m not sure about anything else, but to Mystery Pryers, the goal of
Cogitation and the method to increase our strength is directed toward
the Spirit Body.
“Outside the Spirit Body is the Astral Projection. It is the means for
the Spirit Body to communicate with the spirit world and with stellar
space. It’s considered an external manifestation of the Spirit Body.
Besides, it will be directly related to your personal ambition and your
prevailing emotions… The scenes you see after consuming the potion
are scenes your Astral Projection sees when it wanders through the
spirit world. That world does not obey the laws of the physical world.
It involves exceeding the concept of ‘I,’ the limitless ‘I’, and the
Universe’s ‘I.’ The past, present, and future might be stacked upon
one another and that is the source of divination.
“In the spirit world, what you see is just an imagery, a symbol. You
have to interpret it to understand its actual meaning.
“Divination and many magic spells are cast through the Astral
Projection.
“Do not mistake its relationship and diﬀerences with a Spirit Body.”
One is just a body and the other is for form… Klein continued
looking at the aura in between his ﬁngertips and made the simple
conclusion.
“Further out will be the Body of Heart and Mind. From this point
forth, it will combine with the physical body… It involves your brain
and is an overall manifestation of your inferential abilities, your
analytical abilities, your observational abilities, and identiﬁcation
abilities. Some potions will mainly raise this. Quite a number of
magic spells target it as well.”
Old Neil explained in relatively great detail, “The outermost layer is
the Ether Body. It is a manifestation of your vital energies and
physical form.”
“The aura color you see is an external phenomenon of your Ether
Body. In other words, apart from the spiritual bodies, ghosts, and
specters you can see directly with Spirit Vision, it might also include
certain existences that should not be seen. You can also see the Ether
Bodies of others or their auras. From their thickness, brightness, and
color, you can determine their health and emotional state.
“When your Spirit Vision improves and you grasp more mysticism
knowledge, you will be able to discover even more details. You can
even determine the lifespan of others.
“By the way, the emotional state I mentioned would also manifest
itself because of your Astral Projection. When you go higher in
Sequence, your Spirit Vision will reach a relatively high stage. You
can even be able to see someone else’s Astral Projection. That way,
you will learn even more things. This is a level only Seers and
Mystery Pryers can attain.
“Some fellows even claim that the strongest form of Spirit Vision
allows one to see anything in any place, including the past and
future. However, I’m skeptical about it.”
It sounds quite powerful… Klein was almost turning eager.
Old Neil coughed and continued, “Let’s return to the Ether Body and
the colors of the auras. Your limbs and parts that are required in
motion will appear red. Your head and brain’s surface will appear as
purple. Spots that excrete waste will appear orange. The digestion
system will appear as yellow. The heart and other regulatory systems
will appear green. Your throat and other parts of the nervous system
will appear blue. An entirely balanced body will make a body be
cloaked in white… That is a symbol of health.
“Once it turns dark or the thickness thins, the color will change. That
indicates that the corresponding spot has turned problematic. It
means it’s in a state of exhaustion or illness.
“In addition, the inner layer of the Astral Projection represents
prevailing emotions. Red means passion and excitement. Orange
means warmth and satisfaction. Yellow means happiness and
extroversion. Green means calm and peace. Blue means coldness and
stillness that one is in thought. White means brightness, an eagerness
to improve. Dark colors mean worry, sorrow, and silence. Purple
means that spirituality is taking control of the lead, coldness and
estrangement…”
Klein silently memorized the information and stabilized his initial
Spirit Vision.
“Good, you can look at other objects.” Old Neil did not speak further
as he nodded.
Klein slowly turned his head and looked at Old Neil. Indeed, he saw
diﬀerent colors in diﬀerent parts of his body. The aura was both thick
and thin at diﬀerent spots. The purple color at his head was brightest
and his limbs’ redness was relatively dark. The overall whiteness to
his body was somewhat faded as well.
Indeed, he’s getting on in age… Klein made a silent comment to
himself.
Only with what he saw did he feel that he had become a Beyonder!
“I am now a Beyonder!”
He shifted his gaze and carefully sized up Old Neil when suddenly he
saw a translucent pair of cold and ruthless eyes without any brows in
the void behind him!
This nearly illusory eyes were staring at Old Neil intently, as well as
him!
This… Klein shuddered as he gapped and said, “You have a pair of
eyes behind you!”
Old Neil was taken aback before he forced a smile.
“Ignore them.”
Chapter 33: Switch
The moment Old Neil ﬁnished his sentence, the illusory pair of eyes
that lurked in the darkness behind him vanished. Even in his Spirit
Vision state, Klein was no longer able to identify traces of its
existence.
“This is a characteristic of ritualistic magic,” explained Old Neil with
a chuckle.
Fascinating… Is Spirit Vision an enhanced version of Yin-Yang eyes?
Klein felt like a child who had received a new toy. In excitement, he
turned his gaze way and began observing every corner of the room.
He wanted to see the diﬀerences of the alchemy room with and
without the Spirit Vision.
The outlines of the objects in the dark such as the tables, test tubes,
scales, cups, and cupboards did not look diﬀerent from how it looked
like without Spirit Vision. They did not emit any lights or colors.
Objects without lives do not have any spirituality? Klein mumbled to
himself as he swept his gaze toward the silver chest.
Suddenly, he saw a vibrancy of colors. The colors were as blue as the
sky, as resplendent as the stars, or as crimson red as burning ﬂames!
“Materials from extraordinary beings still have some life in them, and
uh… are still active? Even if the source is already dead?” Klein
deliberated on his words as he sought Old Neil’s help.
“A precise description is that they have remnant spiritualities. It is
one of the crucial points of a successful potion concoction. It is also
one the reasons why a Beyonder will lose control. Dunn should have
already informed you,” explained Old Neil frankly.
He suddenly laughed, having recalled something.
“I remember that the formula of Corpse Collector requires a
desiccated mature black-spotted frog. To consume that potion
requires a lot of courage.”
Klein imagined a little and found it disgusting. He did not echo Old
Neil’s words and turned his gaze to a dark area. However, there were
no spiritual bodies or ghosts that he looked forward to seeing.
“Isn’t it said that the world of spirits is everywhere?” he asked out of
curiosity.
Old Neil chuckled tersely before saying, “Punk, repeat after me.
“This is the headquarters of a Nighthawk squad. This is the ground
beneath the Church of the Evernight Goddess. There are many
Beyonders in here!
“Do you think we will allow spirits and souls to wander around in
here? Furthermore, the spiritual world and spirit are two diﬀerent
concepts.”
Klein felt a little embarrassed as he turned his head, pretending to
look at the faint light from the gas lamps at the entrance.
“I get it.”
While speaking, the area between his brows began to spasm.
What’s happening? Just as Klein turned around to ask, he suddenly
saw a ﬁgure standing quietly by the door at the periphery of the
light. It appeared human, though its aura’s colors and the darkness
blended perfectly, making it impossible to discern.
Hiss!
Klein felt a painful spasm at his glabella 1 . His vision turned chaotic
as he focused his attention again, but there was no “formless” ﬁgure!
Strange… He turned around and asked.
“Mr. Neil, the spot in between my brows is a little painful from
spasms.”
“Haha, this is very common. You are a new Beyonder. Spirit Vision
places a great burden on your Spirit Body. Furthermore, it drains you
constantly. Physical eﬀects can be glabella spasms, headaches,
oversensitivity, and minor bouts of hallucinations. And while viewing
things with Spirit Vision, it’s very easy to feel uncomfortable as a
result of the unfamiliar surroundings. It’s also very easy to have your
emotions aﬀected by others. These are things that require you to pay
attention. You can become accustomed to and eliminate them with
repeated practice. In addition, use it sparingly and end it in a timely
fashion,” answered Old Neil with a smile.
Why does it feel like you are delighted by this… Klein hurriedly
asked for advice, “Then, how do I exit from the state of having Spirit
Vision?”
He had planned on mentioning the invisible ﬁgure he had seen,
though when he heard of the minor bouts of hallucination among the
symptoms, he struck that thought away.
From the glabella spasm and headache, he could completely guess
Old Neil’s answer!
“Like before, think of an item to divert your attention. It will bring
you out of Cogitation. Close your eyes and control your spirituality
and repeatedly tell it to end. When you open your eyes again, you
will discover that your Spirit Vision has ended.”
Old Neil described leisurely and when he was done, added, “Of
course, that is the most trivial and clumsy method. We can repeatedly
hint to ourselves in Cogitation from practice to aﬀect our spirituality.
That way, you will have a simple switch. For instance, tapping at
your glabella twice lightly would allow you easily activate Spirit
Vision. Another two taps will simply end it. As for how you set it up,
it depends on your habits and preferences.
“Got it.” Klein thought for a moment and planned to imitate Old Neil
to use tapping his glabella twice as a switch for his Spirit Vision.
Tapping once was easily mistaken as an instinctive knock to his head
and tapping thrice could be a waste of valuable time in dangerous
situations. As for actions like snapping ﬁngers, they were too
attention-drawing.
He eased his focus and imagined the stacked spheres of light and re-
entered a state of Cogitation.
Under Old Neil’s guidance, after repeated hints and practice, he
ﬁnally “set up” his “switch.”
He clenched his ﬁst slightly and used his index ﬁnger’s joint to tap at
his glabella twice. Immediately, there were glowing auras of diﬀering
thickness and colors appearing before his eyes.
After another two taps, everything returned to normal.
“I’ve ﬁnally grasped it…” he sighed with delight.
Only then did he realize how exhausted he was, feeling like he could
fall asleep at any time. His mind hurt as though he had stayed up for
three nights.
Old Neil said with a chuckle, “We are not Sleepless. Every practice
and every time Spirit Vision is used excessively, you will need some
sleep. You can now go back and have a good rest. In the afternoon,
go to Iron Cross Street where Welch’s place is and walk around. Try
your best to ﬁnd clues about the Antigonus family’s notebook as soon
as possible. Tomorrow, I’ll continue teaching you about mysticism. Of
course, do not forget to read the historical documents.”
“Alright.” Klein was in full agreement with Old Neil’s arrangements.
He picked up his cane and left the alchemy room. He watched the
door close as Old Neil returned to the armory. Klein massaged his
glabella and temples and with the help of his cane, sauntered up the
stairwell.
At that moment, Dunn Smith came from behind him with the corners
of his lips hooked. With a deep gaze, he said, “I heard from Old Neil
that you are a very suitable candidate. Even without Cogitation, you
were able to use Spirit Vision.”
“Perhaps, it’s a unique trait of being a Seer,” replied Klein humbly.
He guessed that Dunn had been watching the armory for Old Neil.
Dunn slowed down and went ahead of Klein a little. After a few
seconds of silence, he turned around and said, “You have to
remember that curiosity killed the cat. It can also kill Beyonders. Do
not attempt to probe the murmurings you should not be listening or
see existences you should not see.”
“Alright.” Klein knew this was another reminder of how Beyonders
lost control.
After entering Blackthorn Security Company, he greeted Rozanne
who obviously did not know that he had become a Beyonder. He
slowly walked out the door and reached the streets where he took a
trackless carriage to Daﬀodil Street. He nearly fell asleep on his
return journey.
It was still in the morning and the temperature was about twenty-six
degree Celsius. Klein pulled out a copper key from his waistband and
opened the door to his home.
There were still many items missing from his home. The living room
and dining hall were still empty. Benson and Melissa had work or
school, so they had both left early in the morning.
Klein did not have the capacity to bother with anything else. He
closed the door and briskly went to the second ﬂoor and entered the
bookshelf-equipped bedroom that belonged to him.
After taking oﬀ his tuxedo and hanging it on a clothing rack, he
eagerly plunged into bed. The moment his head hit the pillow, he fell
asleep.
Klein was awoken by bright sunlight. He turned his head and slowly
opened his eyes to discover the burning sun outside.
“What time is it? Did I miss the Tarot Club in the afternoon?” He
struggled to get up and walked to the clothing rack to take out his
pocket watch from the pocket of the tuxedo’s inner lining.
Not only had he forgotten about the matter, he had forgotten to close
the door to his bedroom and pulled the curtains to the oriel window.
Pa!
Klein pulled out the pocket watch and immediately felt relieved when
he opened it.
It was only slightly past noon. There was still a lot of time until the
scheduled gathering at three in the afternoon.
It was Monday, the day he would have a gathering with The Hanged
Man and Justice.
Klein went into thought as he tapped his glabella twice. The scene
before him changed once again as he saw that his body had restored
to a bright luster.
He tapped twice again and stopped his Spirit Vision. Relaxed, he
went to the ﬁrst ﬂoor and boiled a kettle of water. He placed some
inferior-quality tea leaves and chewed on some rye bread dabbed in a
little butter.
Afterwards, Klein ﬂipped through historical materials and original
Klein’s diary. He began ‘revising’ and consolidating his knowledge.
…
At 2:57pm, Klein closed his book and capped his fountain pen before
pulling the curtains.
Immediately following that, he locked the bedroom’s door, making
the room turn abnormally dark.
He tapped his glabella twice and activated Spirit Vision to survey his
surroundings.
After conﬁrming that there were no invisible spiritual bodies in his
room, Klein stopped the Spirit Vision and took out his pocket watch
to check the time.
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
One minute before three, he opened up his pace and like before,
walked four steps in a counter-clockwise manner in a squarish shape.
He incanted in Chinese softly.
Only this time, he did not prepare any staple food.
Klein closed his eyes as he felt the back of his hands turn itchy. It felt
like the four black docks forming a square was protruding and
projecting something.
Hysterical shouts and alluring murmurs began resounding, but Klein
realized that the headache was not as bad as the ﬁrst time.
It was not that he was unaﬀected, but that he was doing his best to
stop himself from listening.
As a Beyonder, he had to have more self-control in such an
environment.
Soon, his body turned light as he ﬂoated up. He saw the grayish-
white and blurry fog that emanated. Then, he saw dark red ‘stars.’
Two of them had a minuscule connection with him with an abnormal
sense of familiarity.
Klein looked at his blurry self and muttered in confusion, “The Astral
Projection that Old Neil mentioned?”
He remained calm for a few seconds and again transformed the
opulent divine palace with the tall bronze table under the domed
ceiling, as well as the twenty-two high-back chairs that corresponded
to the diﬀerent constellations.
Klein calmly walked to the Seat of Honor and made his body and face
be immersed in thicker gray fog. He extended his right hand and
tapped two familiar deep-red stars and created a miraculous
connection.
Chapter 34: Advance Payment
In an underground basement without any windows, the burly Alger
Wilson sat by a long table with various apparatuses and goatskin
parchments on it.
In front of him was a half-consumed candle. The dim, yellowish
ﬂame’s ﬂickering made the shadows of the objects and table move
like a mirage.
Alger’s hair was disheveled like seaweed with a deep blue color that
resembled black. He wore a robe with lightning patterns embroidered
on it. He clasped his hands with his thumbs facing each other while
he focused on a bottle of black liquid to the left of the candle.
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Splash! Splash! Splash!
The sound of tempestuous winds or the crashing of the sea waves
howled from inside the sealed bottle. And in spots where the black
ink did not sink, a faint fog would swirl. It was as though it grew eyes
and a mouth.
Alger cocked his head to glance at the clock hanging on the wall and
watched the needle strike three.
He pressed down on his temple as his eyes turned dark. Fascinating
colors surfaced from the various items on the table.
At that moment, he discovered a deep-red light appear like a tidal
wave from nowhere, drowning him instantly!
…
Backlund, Empress Borough, Inside the Hall family’s luxurious
mansion.
After dismissing her dance teacher, Audrey locked the door and sat
straight up in front of her dressing table.
The sun outside was bright and gorgeous. There was a light-brown
notebook made of exquisite goat skin. It was ﬂipped open to reveal
that it was blank. To its right was a fountain pen with a golden tip
and embedded rubies.
Audrey did a test and made sure that she could pick up the fountain
pen and write down the formula the moment she left the Gathering.
“I’m so looking forward to it…” She inhaled to repress her excited
emotions as she looked at the mirror with puckered lips.
However, she did not see it reﬂect herself. Instead, a dark red and
illusory beam burst out from her body!
…
Above the gray fog stood a majestic divine hall that looked like a
giant’s residence.
Dark red colors bloomed on both sides of the bronze table. They
surged upwards like a fountain before pattering down. It ‘carved’ two
blurry ﬁgures who sat in the same spots as before.
Audrey, with her soft blond hair and tall, slim build, instinctively
looked towards the Seat of Honor. She saw the ﬁgure immersed in
thick gray fog sitting back. One hand was ﬂat, touching the table’s
side while the other hand was stroking his chin.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Fool~!” Audrey shouted with a cheery voice.
Following that, she turned her head and looked at the person
opposite her. With the same tone, she said, “Good afternoon, Mr.
Hanged Man~!”
This lady sure is unsophisticated. Is she so sure that I’m a good person?
Why isn’t there any fear from her? Is she a noble lady who has been
protected well? Klein smiled and maintained his unfathomable image.
“Good afternoon, Miss Justice.”
As he spoke, he lowered his head slightly and moved his left hand
and tapped his glabella twice.
What he saw changed instantly. He saw Justice and The Hanged Man
emit the colors of their aura!
And the surrounding gray fog and dark red stars remained the same.
Nothing that seemingly did not exist or lustrous brilliances that
possessed life was seen.
He shifted his gaze and saw that Justice’s aura perfectly matched the
colors Old Neil described. What was supposed to be red, purple, blue,
or white were their respective colors. Furthermore, they maintained a
lustrous brilliance and were of appropriate thickness. It was easy to
tell that she was a vibrant young girl.
The colors of her emotions are red and yellow. That’s joy, zeal, and
excitement…Klein made a judgment before casting his attention
towards The Hanged Man.
Like Justice, there was nothing special about the colors of The
Hanged Man’s aura. His emotions were blue mixed in with some
orange.
Calm, thoughtful, careful, and a little pleased? With this being his ﬁrst
attempt, Klein made a conclusion without much conﬁdence.
Just as he shifted his gaze away, he suddenly realized something
strange.
The aura of the Hanged Man’s innermost layer was nearly of the
same color!
Klein focused his mind and took another careful look. He could
faintly see that deep within The Hanged Man’s Ether Body was a
deep blue, akin to the sea. It felt like a tidal storm.
His Astral Projection? Or should I say the surface of his Astral Projection?
From the looks of it, he’s really a Beyonder, and one that’s apparently
stronger than Old Neil.Klein analyzed as his mind was ﬁlled with
questions. “Not necessary. It might have to do with this being a
unique environment. It’s only because this is my home ground that
I’m able to see these things that Old Neil did not manifest.”
He turned his head toward Justice again and conﬁrmed that it was a
characteristic only Beyonders possessed.
At that moment, Alger also completed his greetings.
Audrey drew a light gasp as she asked in anticipation, “Mr. Hanged
Man, did you receive the box of Ghost Shark blood?”
Alger took a look at Klein and saw him tapping his glabella as though
he was considering other matters.
“Thank you very much. It perfectly met my expectations. I never
expected you to send it to me so quickly. The Ghost Shark blood is
not the typical extraordinary creature,” said Alger frankly.
Audrey smiled humbly and said, “I’m very happy to see this
outcome.”
As she loved anything to do with mystery from a young age, she had
befriended those in aristocratic circles with similar interests. They
have exchanged information, books, and rare artifacts among each
other. But before this, none of them had ever obtained any
supernatural power to become a real Beyonder. Instead, there were a
few princes that hinted that they could gift them what they wanted if
they became their princess consort.
However, she had obtained the Ghost Shark blood directly from her
family’s vault. After all, the inventory only states ‘one big bottle,’
without mentioning how many milliliters or how full it had to be, she
believed that pouring a little bit of it would go unnoticed. Even if
there was an accident and the matter was exposed, her parents were
unlikely to pursue the matter.
Alger looked deeply at The Fool who was enveloped in fog before
turning his head back with a smile.
“According to our agreement, I will tell you the formula to the
potion, Spectator.”
“Let me prepare myself. Alright, begin.” Audrey inhaled as she
focused her full attention.
“Low-Sequence potions are very easy to concoct. Just follow the
order that I provide you. Do remember that there can be smaller
quantities of the ingredients but not more. It would cause major
problems. You should have heard about news of Beyonders losing
control. I believe there’s no need for me to repeat it?” Alger ﬁrst
mentioned things to take note of.
Audrey nodded gently and said, “I understand completely.”
While she spoke, she turned her head to look at Mr. Fool. She wished
to know if the mystery expert had anything to add; unfortunately,
The Fool was sitting silently there like a statue.
Alger thought for a moment before saying, “Having smaller quantities
does not mean it should deviate by too much… If you do not have an
assistant, I suggest you spend some time familiarizing yourself with
chemistry experiment.”
“I have a family tutor for such matters,” answered Audrey without
feeling the burden.
After Alger mentioned the furthest extent of the deviation, he recited
with great ﬂuency, “Spectator. Sequence 9 potion. 80 milliliters of
pure water. 5 drops of autumn crocus essence. 13 grams of cow teeth
paeonol powder. 7 petals of elf ﬂowers. A matured Manhal Fish’s
eyeball. Add 35 milliliters of goat-horned black ﬁsh blood.
“The ﬁnal two items are the main ingredients. They are extraordinary
creatures from the sea. You have to be careful.”
“Alright.” Audrey recalled and repeated, “80 milliliters of pure water.
5 drops of autumn crocus essence, 13 grams of cow teeth…”
“Paeonol powder,” reminded Alger.
With his help, Audrey gradually and precisely memorized the
formula’s order. However, she appeared worried as she mumbled it
again and again.
“Do you know about Cogitation?” When Alger saw Justice nod, he
continued, “I do not know how much you know about Cogitation. Let
me describe it once… After consuming the potion, quickly begin
Cogitation to control your spirituality and energy… Make sure to
practice every day to truly grasp the powers of the potion. Dig out
the meaning it symbolizes and even more of its mysteries. That way,
you can avoid the danger of losing control to the greatest extent. And
the meaning of a potion mainly lies in its name, such as Spectator!”
Klein silently listened to the conversation and had no plans on
interrupting. All he did was secretly memorize and study, but when
he heard that, he suddenly had a thought.
Audrey listened to The Hanged Man’s explanations attentively, and
just as she was about to inquire about something more detailed, she
suddenly heard the rapping sound on the table,
She and Alger turned their heads and looked at The Fool. They
realized that the mysterious and mighty ﬁgure was tapping gently
with his ﬁngers. He said in a deep voice, “It’s not about grasping
them, but rather digesting them.
“It’s not about discovery, but rather acting.
“The name of a potion is not only symbolic, it’s also imagery. It is the
key to digesting.”
Audrey was dazed and confused from hearing that. She was not very
clear on what Mr. Fool was trying to express.
She subconsciously eyed The Hanged Man for a reaction from the
corner of her eyes. She was surprised to see him jolt and freeze. It
was as though an ordinary person had heard a loud and sudden clap
of thunder.
“Digesting, acting… Digesting, acting… Digesting, acting, key…”
Alger repeated it again and again softly as though he had grasped a
key concept or had succumbed to a strange curse.
After a while, he raised his head and said with a hoarse voice,
“Thank you, Mr. Fool. Your hint is as valuable as my life. You have
enlightened me greatly. Of course, I believe I have yet to fully
understand or comprehend it.”
Klein maintained his mysterious and unfathomable image by saying
with a smile, “That was an advance payment.”
In fact, he did not truly understand the exact meaning of what was
said. He was just certain that Emperor Roselle was more powerful
than the typical Beyonder and stronger than The Hanged Man.”
Advance payment… Audrey looked at The Hanged Man’s reaction and
knew that the hint from before was precious. As she ruminated over
it, she asked, “Mr. Fool, what do you wish for us to do?”
Opposite to her, Alger said with a nod, “What matter might you wish
to entrust us with?”
Klein leaned back slightly as he glanced at the two of them before
saying in a soft and pleasant voice, “Collect Roselle Gustav’s secret
diary on my behalf, even if it’s just one page of it.”
Chapter 35: Exchange of
Information
Roselle Gustav’s secret diary?
Emperor Roselle?
Indeed, only such matters are worth the concern of a mighty ﬁgure like
Mr. Fool…Audrey was ﬁrst taken aback before she realized that she
found it nothing surprising.
Rumor had it that Emperor Roselle had once seen the Blasphemy
Slate. It was said that the secret cards he created hid the twenty-two
paths of the divine. This was something every high-Sequence
Beyonder would deﬁnitely pay attention to!
“Diary? That’s a diary?” Alger frowned slightly as he keenly noticed
this tidbit.
The item which Roselle Gustav had left behind had been described by
Mr. Fool as a diary!
How did he know?
How did he determine it?
Could he know the way to decipher Roselle’s cryptic text?
Faced with The Hanged Man’s question and having obtained the
desired eﬀect, Klein leaned back into his chair and interlocked his
hands. He answered in a relaxed manner, “Let us ﬁrst view it as a
diary for now.”
He did not deny or conﬁrm it.
Audrey had heard the children of other nobles mention the matter.
However, she had never really learned much of it. With her curiosity
piqued, she asked, “It’s said that Emperor Roselle’s, well, diary was
written in a cryptic language or symbols he invented.”
“Yes,” answered Alger simply. “Some people believe that it is a
unique set of symbols from mysticism. Others believe that it is a
hieroglyph. But up to today, no one has found the correct way of
deciphering it. At the very least, that’s all I know.”
With that said, he turned his head at Klein in a bid to get some
conﬁrmation or show his suspicions.
They are texts that have been passed down for generations, so are no
longer in their original state. According to your line of thought, how can it
be deciphered… Klein maintained his calm as he secretly gave a self-
deprecating laugh.
As for how to handle the symbols of mysticism, he instantly thought
of a ridiculous and funny scene.
Dressed in a black-pointed hat and long robe, an evil mage pulls up
his sleeve to reveal a symbol tattooed on his arm. It was said that this
was a symbol with mysterious power left behind by Emperor Roselle.
They were written in two blue, large simpliﬁed Chinese characters:
“Retarded Joker!”
The corners of Klein’s mouth curved up slowly as he found himself in
a good mood.
After hearing The Hanged Man’s description, Audrey said in a
stumped manner, “We can’t understand the symbols or the words…
Then, how are we to pass the information to you, Mr. Fool? Or are
we to mail it somewhere?”
This is quite an important question… I do not have the means to accept
an item secretly… Klein was in no hurry to answer. His repeatedly
released his thumbs from his interlocked hands before tapping them
back again.
Soon, he thought of a solution.
Since I can create a divine palace and table according to my wishes in
here, would it be possible to project the content in the minds of others
here?
I’ll give it a try…
At that moment, Audrey and Alger saw Mr. Fool slowly sit up amid
the thick grayish fog.
“Miss Justice, let us give it a try. Imagine a paragraph of text and
give it the emotions of writing it with urgency. Yes, pick up the
fountain pen beside you and write on the piece of paper.”
Before Klein ﬁnished his sentence, Audrey saw a piece of yellowish-
brown goatskin parchment and a dark red fountain pen in front of
her.
She picked up the fountain pen both curiously and doubtfully. In
accordance with the instructions, she imagined a poem Emperor
Roselle once wrote:
“If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind 1 ?”
After scrutinizing the text, she picked up her fountain pen and
imbued them with the desire of projecting them out.
Klein sensed the emotions and using the fountain pen as a medium,
he guided her.
The moment Audrey landed her fountain pen, she saw a line appear
on the goatskin parchment.
“If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?”
“Goddess, how fascinating!” Audrey exclaimed in astonishment while
feeling rueful.
Following that, she looked at Klein with some fear.
“Mr. Fool, can you read what I’m thinking?”
“No, I’m only guiding you. I simpliﬁed the process of writing for you
and made it become an imprint. If you did not wish to express it,
nothing would appear.” Klein placated her with a low tone.
“Is that so… Then we can only memorize the symbols or the way the
cryptic text looks like. Then, we can present it directly as we wish?”
Audrey heaved a sigh of relief as she asked in enlightenment.
“Yes.” Klein answered.
“That’s not a bad method. Miss Justice, do not doubt your memory.
After becoming a Spectator, you will receive immense improvement
in this aspect.” Alger had watched the attempt from the side, fully
coming to the realization that The Fool was more powerful and
mysterious than he imagined.
As for his memory, he believed that the next advancement would
improve it suﬃciently.
Regarding this, Audrey nodded in delight.
“You have delighted me with this reminder. Mr. Hanged Man, do you
have any other guidance on Spectators?”
With that said, she looked toward the Seat of Honor.
“Mr. Fool, I will work hard to complete your mission. I will do my
best to gather more of Emperor Roselle’s secret diary.”
“I mentioned before that I’m a person who likes a fair and equal
exchange. The advanced payment I gave is only equivalent to two
pages of the diary for each person. If there are more, I will give
additional in return,” Klein said calmly, like he was an adult who did
not take advantage of children.
As for where the additional payment could come from, it was
naturally from the newly acquired Emperor Roselle diary pages. This
formed a virtuous cycle.
“You are truly a generous gentleman.” Alger fell silent for a few
seconds before bowing slightly with his hand by his chest.
After the bow, he turned to Justice and said, “Let me emphasize once
more. A Spectator will forever be a spectator.
“I know that many Spectators enjoy imagining themselves to be the
protagonist or some other character. As a result, they invest a lot of
feelings into it, to the point of crying, laughing, raging, and turning
sorrowful because of the drama. However, that is not what a
Spectator should do.
“While faced with the various dramas of society and ﬁgures who
knowingly or unknowingly act the role of particular characters, you
have to maintain the attitude of being an absolute bystander. Only
then can you calmly and objectively observe them. You will discover
their habits, their tics from lying, or their scent of nervousness. From
those minute clues, you can grasp their true thoughts.
“Believe me, everyone is diﬀerent because of their emotions. They
will secrete diﬀerent ‘things’ and diﬀerent smells. However, only a
real Spectator can sniﬀ it out.
“Once you invest too many of your emotions, your observation will
be inﬂuenced. Your sensitivity towards the emotions of others will
deviate.”
Audrey listened attentively as her eyes brightened gradually.
“It sounds, really, really interesting!”
Klein’s heart stirred when he heard that.
The Spectator potion’s requirement when summarized seemed to be
“an absolutely objective and neutral spectator.”
In a particular sense, it was equivalent to acting…
Acting?
Was this the ‘acting’ which Emperor Roselle was referring to?
Then, I will have to act as a Seer, and from there, digest the potion bit by
bit?
Just as Klein was immersing himself in thought, Alger ﬁnished
explaining the demands he knew of a Spectator. He sighed before
saying, “It seems like there’s nothing else?
“Perhaps we can have a casual chat. We can talk about things
happening around us. Perhaps it is something very normal to you,
but in the ears of others, it might be a very important clue.”
“Sure.” Klein snapped back and nodded slightly.
He was already planning to attempt to act as a Seer. After all, it did
not seem like there were any negative eﬀects from doing so.
“Then, shall we begin with you, Mr. Hanged Man?” Audrey agreed in
excitement.
Alger thought for a moment before saying, “The infamous pirate who
calls himself Lieutenant General Deweyville has begun his voyage to
explore the eastern end of the Sonia Sea again.”
“Oh? The owner of the Black Tulip?” returned Audrey with a
question after some thought.
“Yes,” Alger replied with a nod.
I don’t even know who that is… Klein listened silently while he
pondered over the news he planned on sharing. It had to be
something that did not expose him while also allowing him to gain
feedback.
Soon, he decided. He maintained his unfathomable image as The Fool
and caressed the side of the bronze table with his ﬁngers.
“According to what I know, the Secret Order has lost an Antigonus
family notebook.”
This news was not only known by the Nighthawks from Tingen City.
The Secret Order as well as Beyonders with close ties with them
similarly knew.
“An Antigonus family notebook?” Alger repeated before smiling with
a shake of his head. “I’m really curious as to what reaction the
Church of the Evernight Goddess will have if they learn of it.”
Why would he mention the Church of the Evernight Goddess? Klein
acutely sensed a problem, but it was not appropriate for him to ask.
That would shatter his image as the mysterious and profound Fool.
At that moment, Audrey asked out of curiosity, “Why are you
curious? What sort of special reaction would the Goddess’s church
have?”
Alger smiled and said, “The Antigonus family was destroyed by the
Church of the Evernight Goddess.”
“I’m not really sure if it happened at the end of the Fourth Epoch or
the early stages of the present epoch.”
This… Klein’s pupils constricted as a chill suddenly swept through
him.
From the looks of it, the value the Nighthawks have placed on this
Antigonus notebook far exceeds my imagination!
The reason why they nominated me as a Beyonder—having some
contribution and to prevent danger to me are likely negligible reasons—is
that they wish for me to raise my spiritual sensitivity to aid them in
ﬁnding the notebook.
This was not kept from me by Captain. He had mentioned it, but I just
didn’t pay much attention to it…
After hearing The Hanged Man’s explanation, Audrey said with deep
interest, “I never imagined that such a thing would happen…
“Alright, my turn. Let me think of what I have to share.”
She cocked her head and held her head up with her hand before
chuckling.
“Yesterday, my etiquette teacher taught me how to faint, how to faint
elegantly without any faux paus. It’s a practical skill used at social
events to avoid awkward situations or nasty guys… Heh heh. I was
just organizing my thoughts. What I really wanted to say is that ever
since the failure of the battle on Balam’s eastern shore, the king,
premier, and gentlemen are under immense stress. They eagerly wish
to change.”
Chapter 36: A Simple Question
While Audrey recalled the conversation between her father and elder
brother about the situation, she put in her own words, “They believe
that the government’s structure is too chaotic. Every election, if there
is a change of the ruling party, there will be a change of personnel
from top to bottom. It makes things a mess and lowers eﬃciency
tremendously. Not only does it cause the battle loss, it also brings
great inconvenience to the civilians.”
Klein knew very well that as there was no example to reference, the
Loen Kingdom had yet to evolve into a system that examined public
servants. The political situation was still in its preliminary stages;
therefore, after every election victory, many so-called positions
would be awarded to members and supporters.
Hmm, Emperor Roselle not establishing such an institution in Intis
does not match his personality… Could it be that he diverted his
focus to other things later in life?
When the Hanged Man, Alger, heard that he interjected with a soft
chuckle.
“They believe? Then their beliefs are a little slow. Perhaps they will
only feel the itch a year after they get bitten by black mosquitoes.”
Black mosquitoes were a type of creature that resided in the south of
the Loen Kingdom. It was extremely venomous, and its venom made
victims have the urge to rip apart their skin.
Audrey extended her palm and covered her mouth. Ignoring the
Hanged Man’s mockery, she expressed the core information of what
she said, “Unfortunately, they are temporarily unable to ﬁnd a good
solution to replace this system.”
Klein listened carefully and felt that the topic was in the domain of
his expertise. He smiled faintly and said, “This is a simple problem.”
The Foodaholic Empire and the decadent countries that studied the
Foodaholic Empire had very advanced experiences of success.
“Simple?” Audrey returned with a question in puzzlement.
Although her education did not include politics, she often heard from
the discussions of her father, brother, and people around her. She had
a suﬃcient understanding of similar matters.
Klein felt as though he had returned to the message boards of
yesteryear. Composed, he said, “An examination, just like an
entrance-examination for college. Hold an exam that is open to the
public. It can be split into two rounds or three rounds. Use the most
objective method to select the elite.”
“But…” Audrey knew what sort of objection this would entail.
Before she had the chance to arrange her thoughts, Klein continued,
“After which, use these elites to ﬁll the positions of the Cabinet, the
county government, the city government, and the various towns. Yes,
the positions that are directly handling matters, such as the Secretary
of the Cabinet.
“Diﬀerent positions should be given diﬀerent requirements. The
second or third rounds can be tested based on locale and region.
Professional matters should be left to the professionals.
“As for political positions such as ministers, governors or mayors,
they will be left to the parties that win the election. That is a slice of
the pie they deserve.”
Alger, who lacked interest in such matters, unknowingly turned his
head and listened carefully. Audrey frowned slightly as she fell into
deep thought.
“There’s no hurry in replacing everyone at once. The cabinet and
various agencies in the civil service will be crippled if that happens.
You can have an examination every year or every three years. They
can be gradually replaced. Finally, in light of the kingdom’s
expansion and the salaried civil servants’ resignations that will bring
in vacancies, you can systematically allot spots.” Klein fully expressed
his talent as a keyboard politician. He then faced his palm outwards
and said, “Such a design can bring the kingdom’s insightful elites into
the government. Regardless of the party in power or who the minister
is, the civil service will allow the kingdom to maintain its basic and
eﬀective operations.”
Of course, a side eﬀect was the birth of the undying devil that was
bureaucracy.
While considering the suggestion, Audrey asked doubtfully, “Are you
implying that even if those ministers become monkeys, the eﬀects
would be insigniﬁcant?”
“No,” Alger interjected suddenly. “I believe that monkeys are a better
choice than the present ministers.”
He paused before adding, “After all, monkeys only need to eat, sleep,
and mate. They would not come up with foolish ideas and insist on
brainless projects.”
Mr. Hanged Man, it sounds you have quite a terrible superior… Klein
sat at his seat of honor and shook his head in silent amusement.
Audrey ruminated over the suggestion Mr. Fool had oﬀered and after
a while, said in surprise, “It sounds like it actually might work…
“It’s a very simple but eﬀective solution!”
She looked at Klein and sincerely marveled, “Mr. Fool, you must be
an elderly person with outstanding intelligence who is very
experienced in life!”
… The corners of Klein’s mouth twitched a little as he looked at the
Hanged Man and Justice for a few silent seconds.
“Let us end today’s gathering here.”
If Miss Justice is able to inﬂuence her family and eﬀect change on
this matter, I can guide Benson ahead of time and give him a chance
at becoming a civil servant.
On careful thought, Benson was indeed suitable for such a career.
However, it is unlikely Justice would take the initiative to do it. This
is because the Hanged Man and I can easily ﬁnd out which noble
suggested it and basically guess her identity.
Of course, she could do it through a roundabout manner secretly.
“By your will.” Audrey and Alger stood up together.
Klein leaned back slightly and severed the connection. He saw Justice
and the Hanged Man’s illusory and blurry ﬁgures instantly shatter
and dissipate.
Above the gray fog, in the opulent palace where gods seemingly
lived, he was the only one sitting silently at the head of the bronze
table.
Klein did not plunge into the gray fog like the other time to leave.
This was because his mind was still energetic enough after becoming
a Beyonder.
The reason why he had ended the Tarot Club early was because he
learned the true attitude the Nighthawks had towards the Antigonus
notebook. He decided that he had to search for it seriously and not
sleep all the way. Doing so would make Dunn Smith suspicious of his
activities at home.
Furthermore, he had beneﬁted quite a lot this time.
Klein sat on the high-back chair at the head of the bronze table. His
arms leaned on the armrest as he crossed his ﬁngers while he
observed the boundless gray fog carefully. He found the place serene
as though no one had stepped into it for ten million years.
When he established the connection to summon the Hanged Man and
Justice, he acutely noticed something.
That was the fact that as a Beyonder himself, he had the ability to
touch another dark red star!
“Does this mean I can summon one more?” Klein recalled the feeling
and muttered in conﬁrmation.
However, he did not have the urge to make an attempt since he did
not know what the identity of the newcomer would be or what sort
of attitude they would have. After all, not everyone was like Justice
or the Hanged Man who had unique personalities that easily blended
in and took whatever they needed. They even seemed willing to
conceal matters. If he pulled someone like Dunn Smith, then the
mysterious organization he had just established would instantly come
under the watch of the church.
As an “evil” organization’s boss, his future would be worrying.
Klein knew that the gray fog was special. He knew it was not
something a Beyonder at Dunn Smith’s Sequence could see through.
But the problem was that since he had the powers of a Beyonder, he
had to consider the existence of the gods.
Klein had chosen to carefully believe that the seven orthodox gods
existed in reality. Of course, he was more tenable to the belief that
these gods were just more powerful than high-Sequence Beyonders.
Furthermore, they were under strict limitations. At the very least,
ever since the Fifth Epoch, apart from a few oracles, they have not
appeared again.
“Heh, forcefully pulling people here isn’t a good thing. No one would
wish to be pulled into mystery for some baﬄing reason… Let’s wait
and see how things go in the future…” Klein sighed and stood up.
He released his spirituality and sensed his body’s existence. Then, he
began imitating the heavy feeling of rapidly plunging down.
The scenes in front of him changed. The gray fog and dark red
instantly departed him. Klein felt like he had torn through endless
water membranes before ultimately seeing the real world, his room in
darkness.
This time, he was fully awake and seriously took in the entire
experience.
“Strange… There are some diﬀerences between the gray fog and the
spirit world…” Klein moved his limbs and felt the existence of his
body.
After he seriously thought through the experience, he shook his head,
walked to the desk and pulled open the curtains.
Whoosh!
The curtains were drawn as sunlight poured in, illuminating the
room.
As he looked at the street outside the oriel window and the
pedestrians going back and forth, Klein took a deep breath and
muttered silently, “It’s time to go out and work.
“How should I act as a Seer?”
“It cannot be rushed… All I can do is use Spirit Vision now…”
…
Backlund, Empress Borough.
Audrey Hall looked at herself in the mirror. She saw her cheeks
ﬂushed red with excitement and her eyes, so bright that they would
have daunted anyone from looking into them.
She did not examine any of this as she hurriedly recalled. She picked
up the ruby-studded fountain pen and wrote the formula to the
Spectator potion on the exquisite goatskin parchment.
“80 milliliters of pure water. 5 drops of autumn crocus essence, 13
grams of cow teeth paeonol powder. 7 petals of elf ﬂowers. A
matured Manhal Fish’s eyeball. 35 milliliters of goat-horned black
ﬁsh blood.”
Phew… Audrey heaved a sigh of relief as she read it a few times to
conﬁrm that she had not made any mistakes.
She had the urge to dance again, but reminded herself to remain
restrained.
After some thought, she began writing various chemical names
around the potion’s formula. She then faked the page into
complicated and messy chemistry.
Yes, as long as one doesn’t read it carefully, a person who ﬂips
through this randomly will not discover the details I have hidden in
here… Excellent! Audrey praised herself and turned her mind
towards the acquirement of the materials.
“I’ll ﬁrst search the few vaults we have. I’ll then attempt to exchange
for the missing parts with others…”
“If I still can’t gather them all, I can only seek help from the Hanged
Man or the Fool… What can I oﬀer as payment?”
After some thought, Audrey closed the notebook and placed it on a
tiny bookshelf. Following that, she briskly walked to the door and
pulled it open.
A golden retriever was sitting obediently outside.
The corners of Audrey’s mouth curled as she revealed a radiant smile.
“Susie, you completed the mission perfectly!”
“In the serialized stories on the newspapers, detectives would often
have a capable assistant. I think there should be a huge dog
supporting a real Spectator~”
…
In an underground basement lit only by a ﬂickering candle, Alger
Wilson raised his palm and looked at it carefully.
After a long while, he let out a sigh.
“It’s still that miraculous. I was unable to ﬁgure out any speciﬁc
details at all…”
Despite having made suﬃcient preparations, he failed to understand
how the Fool had completed the summoning…
He moved his gaze down and looked at the goatskin parchment on
the table in front of him.
At the title head of the yellowish-brown parchment, there was a
Hermes sentence written in dark blue ink.
“7. Seafarer.”
Chapter 37: The Club
Under the scorching afternoon sun, Klein left his house.
Since he had to walk all the way from Iron Cross Street to Welch’s
place, he wore a linen shirt instead of his formal attire of top hat and
leather boots. He wore a matching brown coat, a round felt hat and a
pair of old leather shoes. That way, he did not need to worry that the
stench of his sweat would contaminate the rather expensive suit.
As he went down Daﬀodil Street, he strolled toward Iron Cross Street.
When he passed by the square around the corner, he subconsciously
took a glance.
The tents had already vanished. The circus troupe from before had
left after ﬁnishing their performance.
Klein originally imagined the animal trainer who had helped him tell
his fortune to be a hidden expert. He believed she had purposely
appeared to guide him after discovering something unique about him
and that she would meet him and provide hints for the future.
However, none of that happened. She left for the next stop in the tour
with the circus troupe.
How can there be so many cliched tropes… Klein shook his head while
grimacing a smile. He turned toward Iron Cross Street.
Iron Cross Street was not characterized by just a single street. Like its
name suggested, it was formed by two roads that crossed each other.
With the intersection at its core, it was split into Left Street, Right
Street, Upper Street, and Lower Street. Klein, Benson, and Melissa
previously lived on Lower Street.
However, the residents living at his former apartment and the
surrounding area did not think of the area as Lower Street. Instead,
they created the term Middle Street. By doing so, they made a clear
diﬀerence between those staying there and the poor who lived two
hundred meters down the road.
There, a bedroom was occupied by ﬁve or six people, and sometimes
even up to ten.
Klein walked along the periphery of Left Street as he let his mind
wander. He recalled the Antigonus family’s notebook and how it was
missing. He thought of its importance to the Nighthawks and thought
of the deaths that resulted from it.
His heart slowly turned heavy as his face turned ashen.
At that moment, a familiar voice sounded.
“Lad.”
Oh… Klein turned his head curiously and found himself by Smyrin
Bakery’s entrance. Mrs. Wendy with a head of gray hair was greeting
him with a wave and a warm smile.
“You don’t look… very happy?” Wendy asked genially.
Klein rubbed his face and said, “A little.”
“Regardless of your worries, tomorrow will always come,” said Mrs.
Wendy with a smile. “Here, try out my newly created sweet iced tea.
I’m not sure if it suits the palate of the locals.”
“Locals? Aren’t you one, Mrs. Smyrin?” Klein shook his head in
amusement.
Trying out something means it’s free, right?
Wendy Smyrin raised her chin a little and said, “You guessed right.
I’m actually a Southerner. I came to Tingen with my husband, but
that was more than forty years ago. Heh heh, back then, Benson was
not born yet. Even your parents did not know each other.
“I have always been a little unaccustomed to the dietary preferences
of Northerners and I’m always missing my hometown’s food. I miss
pork sausages, potato bread, roasted pancakes, vegetables fried in
lard, and roasted meat with specialty sauces.”
“Oh, and I also miss sweet iced tea…”
Klein suﬀused a smile when he heard that.
“Mrs. Smyrin, this sure is a topic that makes me hungry… But I feel a
lot better. Thank you very much.”
“Delicacies can always cure sorrow.” Wendy handed him a cup of
brownish-red liquid. “This is sweet iced tea I made according to my
memories. Try it and tell me if it’s nice.”
After thanking her, Klein took a sip and found it resembling iced red
tea from Earth. However, it was not as stimulating. The taste of tea
was stronger and felt more refreshing. It instantly expelled the heat
brought by the burning sun.
“It’s excellent!” he marveled.
“That puts me at ease.” Wendy smiled with squinted eyes as she
watched him ﬁnish the cup of tea in a genial manner.
After chatting with Mrs. Smyrin about his moving, Klein returned to
the street he was most familiar with.
There were far fewer street side hawkers in the afternoon. They
gathered again after half past ﬁve. The ones that stayed behind
looked drowsy and listless.
The moment he entered the area, Klein’s heart suddenly felt
overwhelmed by darkness. His heart felt heavy, down, and gloomy
for an inexplicable reason.
What’s happening? He sharply sensed something wrong about himself.
He immediately stopped and observed his surroundings, but did not
see anything strange.
After some thought, Klein raised his hand and tapped his glabella like
he was thinking.
The extent of his vision immediately transformed. The auras of the
hawkers and pedestrians all appeared.
Before Klein could observe the colors of their health, his attention
was pulled away by the colors that represented gloominess.
He was unable to determine the exact thoughts of the observed, but
the despondent, apathetic, and gloomy impression was deeply carved
into his heart.
As he surveyed the area, he realized that even the sun could not
disperse those dark colors.
It was a sense of gloom that tainted them from years of repression.
Upon seeing this, Klein instantly understood the reason.
Just as Old Neil said, activating his Spirit Vision easily pulled him
into unfamiliar environments and made him feel discomfort. It was
also easy for himself to be aﬀected by the emotions of others.
A similar principle could be used on an ability like perception. This
was an ability he obtained without additional practice after becoming
a Seer. It was a passive sense that could not be declined. It allowed
him to directly sense the existence of anything abnormal.
There was bound to be a level of interaction when perceiving things;
therefore, in the Beyonder eyes of someone like a Spirit Medium, the
intensity of everyone’s perception is clear. It is like a ﬁre in the night.
Therefore, people with high perceptivity were naturally aﬀected by
the intense atmosphere of anything abnormal. It could only be
repeatedly practiced to grasp, control, and adapt to such outcomes.
“Such a repressed color is probably formed over extended periods of
time, right?” Klein sighed as he shook his head, feeling somewhat
aﬀected.
He tapped his glabella twice again and tried hard to converge his
spirituality.
Tap. Tap. Tap. Klein walked toward the apartment and sensed for any
abnormal existences or tiny connections while also searching for the
Antigonus family’s notebook which “he” had hidden.
The streets were the same as usual. There was ﬁlthy water and trash
on the streets. It only cleared up when he reached the apartment’s
entrance.
Klein pushed open the half-closed door and circled the ﬁrst ﬂoor in
the darkness that the sunlight could not reach.
The wooden stairs creaked constantly as he went up them.
The second ﬂoor was as dim as always. Klein released his perception
and looked into the darkness.
However, not only did he fail to discover any clues regarding his
notebook, he even failed to see any invisible spiritual bodies.
“If it’s so easy to encounter them, most ordinary people would not
have already sensed the existence of extraordinary matters…” Klein
sighed in reﬂection.
He had already understood that most “spirits” did not exist in the
form of spiritual bodies, but in the form of spirituality. Only a Spirit
Medium could eﬀectively communicate with them.
After circling the third ﬂoor once, Klein left the apartment and
retraced his memory’s footsteps towards Welch’s place.
He walked for a full hour but did not discover anything along the
way.
Standing outside the gardened bungalow, Klein looked at the
building through the locked iron gates and mumbled to himself,
“There’s no need for me to search Welch’s place, right? Captain and
Madam Daly must have done a carpet search of the place…
“Besides, I don’t have the key. They can’t expect me to climb the
walls, right…
“I’ll try another path tomorrow…
“I’ve walked so much today, but there are no step counter
rankings…”
While lampooning, Klein returned to the nearby district. He planned
on taking a public carriage to Blackthorn Security Company to
retrieve his daily allocation of thirty bullets. He needed to make use
of his time and practice.
A Seer’s lack of quick and eﬀective oﬀensive means could only be
made up with his revolver and cane!
The district around Welch’s place was relatively clean. Shops with
clean and bright windows lined the two sides of the street.
At the turn of the street, Klein was just about to seek out the carriage
stop when his gaze swept past a few signboards on the second ﬂoor.
“Harrods Department Store.”
“Military Veterans Mess.”
“Divination Club.”
…
Divination Club… Klein silently repeated the name and recalled that
he had to ‘act’ as a Seer.
Yes, I should take a look… and seek out new ideas…
Amid his mixed thoughts, Klein went across the street and went to
the second ﬂoor. He entered the main foyer to see a beautiful female
attendant.
The woman with coiled brownish-yellow hair sized up Klein before
saying with a smile, “Sir, do you wish to have your fortune told, or
do you wish to join our club?”
“What are the conditions for entry?” asked Klein casually.
The woman explained with great familiarity, “Fill in your particulars
and pay an annual membership fee. The ﬁrst year is ﬁve pounds and
subsequent years will be one pound a year. Don’t worry, we are not
like political or business clubs which allow entry through
recommendations from formal members.
“Members can freely use the club’s meeting room and various
divination rooms and tools. They can enjoy the coﬀee and tea we
provide and read the newspapers and magazines we subscribe for
free. They can buy lunch, dinner, and alcoholic beverages at cost
price, as well as education materials and materials needed for
divination.
“In addition, we invite at least one famous fortune-teller to lecture
every month to answer any questions.
“Most importantly, you can ﬁnd a bunch of friends with the same
hobbies and have an exchange with them.”
It sounds pretty good, but… I do not have the money… Klein gave a self-
deprecating smile before asking, “Then what if I want my fortune
told?”
Chapter 38: Novice Hobbyist
Upon hearing Klein’s question, the beautiful lady with elegantly tied-
up brownish-yellow hair appeared to lose her patience. However, she
maintained her smile and said, “Our members are free to do
divination for others in the club. They also have their prices and we
take a very tiny cut as a fee. If you wish to have your fortune told,
you can take a look at this album. It has introductions and rates of
the members who are willing to do divination for others.”
“However, it’s Monday afternoon, so most of our members are busy
at work. We only have ﬁve here today…”
As she introduced the club, she invited Klein to have a seat on the
sofa beside a window in the reception hall. Then, she ﬂipped through
the album and pointed out the present club members.
“Hanass Vincent. Famous Tingen fortune-teller. The club’s resident
mentor. Good at various forms of divination. He charges four soli
each time.”
It’s really expensive… That’s enough to feed Benson, Melissa, and me to
two sumptuous dinners… Klein clicked his tongue silently and did not
reply.
When the woman saw this, she continued ﬂipping the page and
introducing one member after another.
“…And the ﬁnal one, Glacis. A member who joined the club this
year. He is skilled in tarot divination. He charges two pence each
time.
“Sir, who do you plan on choosing?”
Klein did not stand on ceremony and answered, “Mr. Glacis.”
“…” The female attendant fell silent for two seconds before saying,
“Sir, I have to remind you that Mr. Glacis is only considered a
novice.”
“I understand. I will be responsible for my own decision.” Klein
nodded with a smile.
“…Then please follow me.” The woman stood up and led Klein
through a door beside the reception hall.
It was not a very long corridor and an open meeting room was
situated at its end. There was enough sunlight and it was equipped
with tables and chairs. There were newspapers, magazines, and paper
cards. A faint coﬀee aroma drifted out.
About two rooms from the meeting room, the attendant gestured for
Klein to stop. She sped up her pace and entered the room. She
shouted gently, “Mr. Glacis, someone wishes for your divination.”
“Me?” A voice ﬁlled with surprise and doubt immediately sounded.
Following that, there was the sound of a chair moving.
“Yes, which divination room would you like to use?” replied the lady
without any emotion.
“Topaz Room. I like topaz.” Glacis appeared by the meeting room’s
door and looked curiously at Klein who was waiting not far away.
He was a man in his thirties; his skin was slightly dark and his pupils
were a dark green shade. Under his light, yellow and soft hair, he was
dressed in a white shirt and black vest. A monocle hung from his
chest and he seemed to have a good disposition.
The attendant did not say anything further as she opened the door to
the Topaz Room which was next to the meeting room.
The curtains inside were tightly shut, making it dim. It appeared that
only by doing so would one gain revelations from the gods and spirits
to obtain an accurate divination outcome.
“Hello there. I’m Glacis. I never expected you to choose me for your
divination.” Glacis gave a gentleman’s bow, briskly stepped into the
room, and sat behind a long table. “Frankly, I’m only attempting
divination for others. I do not have much experience. For now, I’m
not a good fortune-teller. You still have a chance for regret.”
After Klein returned the bow, he entered and closed the door behind
him.
By the light seeping through the curtains, he said with a smile, “You
are a really honest man, but I’m someone who is very ﬁrm on his
choices.”
“Please have a seat.” Glacis pointed at the seat in front of him and
thought for a few seconds. “Divination is my hobby. Heh heh. In life,
one often receives guidance from the divine, but the ordinary person
is unable to accurately understand the meaning. This is the reason
why divination exists and also why I joined this club. In this aspect, I
still lack conﬁdence. Let’s make the divination that follows an
exchange, a free exchange. How do you like my suggestion? I’ll cover
the fees the club requires. It’s just a quarterpence.”
Klein did not agree or shake his head. Instead, he smiled.
“From the looks of it, you have a pretty well-paying and decent job.”
While he said so, he leaned his body forward slightly. He held his
forehead with his right ﬁst and tapped at it twice.
“But that does not enhance the accuracy of my divination,” answered
Glacis humorously. “Does your head hurt? Do you want to divine
problems regarding health?”
“A little. I wish to divine where an item is.” Klein had already
thought of an excuse as he slowly leaned back.
In his eyes, Glacis’s aura clearly presented itself. The orange colors by
his lungs were dark and sparse. They even inﬂuenced the brightness
in other areas.
This is not a symptom of exhaustion… Klein nodded in an indiscernible
manner.
“Are you searching for a lost item?” Glacis thought for a few seconds
before saying, “Then let’s do a simple determination.”
He pushed the neatly stacked tarot cards on the black table toward
Klein.
“Calm down. Think of that item and ask yourself ‘can it still be
found.’ While doing so, shuﬄe and cut the deck.”
“Alright.” Klein actually did not remember what the ancient
notebook looked like. All he could do was repeat the question to
himself: Can the Antigonus family’s notebook still be found?
While he repeated the thought, he skillfully shuﬄed and cut the
deck.
Glacis picked the topmost card and pushed it in front of Klein. The
card was facing down horizontally.
“Turn it clockwise until it sits vertical. Then ﬂip it open. If the card is
inverted, which means the picture on the card is facing away from
you, it indicates that the item cannot be found. If the card is upright,
then we can continue the divination and seek its actual location.”
Klein followed his instructions and turned the horizontal card
vertical.
He clasped the end of the tarot card and ﬂipped it over.
It was an inverted card.
“What a pity.” Glacis sighed.
Klein did not respond because his attention was focused on the tarot
card in front of him.
The inverted card’s picture was dressed in gorgeous clothes and
splendid headdress—The Fool!
It’s The Fool again? It can’t be so coincidental, right… According to the
Hanged Man and Old Neil, divination is the outcome of the
communication of spirituality and the spirit world with a higher-
dimensional “me.” Tarot cards are only a convenient tool to read what the
truth symbolizes. In theory, using any divination item doesn’t matter as it
doesn’t aﬀect the outcome… Klein frowned as he thought for a
moment.
“Can it be divined whether the item is already in the hands of
others?”
“Of course. Follow the same procedure and do it again.” Glacis
nodded with rich interest.
Klein shuﬄed and cut the deck while thinking of his question.
He drew a card and placed it horizontally before turning it vertical
clockwise. He ﬁnished all the preparations with a serious expression.
Taking a deep breath, Klein reached out his hand and ﬂipped over
the tarot card.
Please do not be The Fool again…
While praying, he suddenly relaxed because the card was that of The
Star and it was inverted!
“From the looks of it, the item has not been taken by others yet,”
interpreted Glacis with a smile.
Klein nodded and raised his right hand. He tapped his glabella,
looking as though he was deep in thought. Then, he took out two
pennies with a dark copper luster from his pocket and pushed it
towards Glacis.
“Didn’t I say it was free?” Glacis said with a frown.
Klein laughed as he got up.
“This is the respect divination deserves.”
“Alright, thank you for your generosity.” Glacis stood up and reached
out his hand.
After shaking his hand, Klein took two steps back and turned around.
He walked to the door and twisted the doorknob.
Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly turned his head and made
a terse sound.
“Mr. Glacis, I suggest that you see a doctor as soon as possible. Focus
on your lungs.”
“Why?” asked Glacis in surprise.
Are you cursing me because you aren’t pleased with the divination results?
Klein thought for a moment before saying, “It’s a symptom based on
the color of your face. You, well… your glabella seems dark 1 .”
“Glabella seems dark…” It was the ﬁrst time Glacis was hearing such
a description.
Klein did not explain further as he walked out the room with a smile.
He closed the wooden door behind him.
“Is he an unlicensed doctor or a herbalist?” Glacis shook his head,
amused. He then picked up his monocle for divination.
On careful look, he realized his glabella was indeed dark.
But this was a problem of the environment. In the darkness due to
the closed curtains, not only was his glabella dark, his entire face was
shrouded in darkness!
“It’s not a very likable joke.” Glacis muttered.
He worriedly divined his own health to make sure that everything
was alright.
…
After leaving the Divination Club, Klein had an additional plan for
the future.
It was to save as much money as possible to pay the annual fee to
become a member of the club. After which, he could begin acting as a
Seer.
As for why he did not choose to do it independently, it was because
he temporarily lacked the resources and channels. He could not bring
himself to stand on the streets as a hawker since he cared for his
reputation.
A few minutes later, the public carriage arrived. He spent two pence
and reached Zouteland Street which was not very far oﬀ.
He pushed open the door to Blackthorn Security Company but did
not see the familiar brown-haired girl. He only saw the black-haired,
green-eyed Leonard Mitchell with his poetic bearing behind the
reception counter.
“Good afternoon. Where’s Rozanne?” Klein asked after taking oﬀ his
hat and bowing.
Leonard smiled and pointed at the partition.
“It’s her shift tonight at the armory.”
Without waiting for Klein to ask another question, Leonard said as
though he was pondering over a matter, “Klein, I have a question that
has always puzzled me.”
“What is it?” Klein was puzzled.
Leonard stood up and smilingly said with a relaxed tone, “Why did
Welch and Naya commit suicide on the spot while you returned
home?”
“It likely has to do with how the unknown existence made me take
the Antigonus family’s notebook away to hide it,” answered Klein
with the oﬃcial surmise.
Leonard paced around before turning to look straight into Klein’s
eyes.
“If your suicide was meant to silence you and wipe out any clues,
why weren’t you made to destroy the notebook there and then?”
Chapter 39: Interesting Trick
In fact, I do not know if the notebook is destroyed or hidden… but by
using backward reasoning, if it is to be destroyed, it could have been done
on the spot. There was no need for me to take it away to carry out the
destruction…
Upon hearing Leonard’s question, Klein instantly went into keyboard
detective mode and said with a sigh, “Perhaps when Welch, Naya,
and I made contact with the unknown existence, it enjoyed the
sacriﬁce of life or wished for similar situations to continue. With the
suicide deﬁnitely easily discoverable, I was made to take away the
notebook to hide it so as to prepare for the existence’s second round
of entertainment. However, some mishap happened during the
process and I failed to succeed in my suicide.”
This was a reasoned guess Klein made from his consumption of
novels, movies, and TV dramas which involved cult sacriﬁces.
As for the mishap that happened midway, he knew very well that it
was due to the unexpected variable of him being a transmigrator.
“Quite a good explanation, but I believe there might be other
possibilities. Welch’s and Naya’s suicide sacriﬁce might have made it
possible for the unknown existence to descend on this world. Then,
that notebook is a vessel or a breeding ground for evil. It made you
take it away to hide it, worried that we would destroy it if we
discovered its birth—before it became strong.” Leonard Mitchell
suggested another possibility.
Having said that, he stared into Klein’s eyes and smiled slightly.
“Of course, perhaps the notebook has been destroyed. The goal is to
hide its content, to conceal the vessel or the brooding of evil. That
way, there is a suﬃcient reason for your failed suicide.”
What does he mean? Is he suspecting me? Is he suspecting that the original
Klein’s body is a vessel or used for the brooding of evil? No, what he’s
being a vessel for is a transmigrator… Actually, “Brooding” isn’t a correct
term. Klein was taken aback. While he secretly criticized the idea, he
weighed his words.
“I will not try to defend myself since I’ve lost memories from that
period. Be it Captain or Madam Daly, they have already conﬁrmed
that I’m ﬁne. Your joke isn’t funny.”
“I’m only considering a possibility. It does not eliminate the blow the
unknown existence encountered when it descended which caused
your suicide to fail. We believe that the Goddess will ultimately bless
us.” Leonard laughed as he changed the subject. “Did you discover
anything in the afternoon?”
After the conversation and the previous encounters, Klein was very
wary of Leonard. He answered in a composed manner, “No. I plan on
trying a diﬀerent route tomorrow afternoon.”
He pointed to the partition and said, “I’ll need to head to the armory
to draw the bullets.”
The Shooting Club opened to nine at night. After all, its availability
increased only after many of its members got oﬀ work.
“May Goddess bless you.” Leonard smiled as he gestured the sign of
the crimson moon on his chest.
He watched Klein pass through the partition and listened to his
footsteps down the stairs. Leonard’s smile gradually vanished as a
look of doubt appeared in his green eyes.
He whispered something with a displeased tone.
…
Down the stairs, Klein followed the gas lamp-illuminated corridor to
the armory and archives.
The iron door was open and the brown-haired Rozanne was standing
in front of the table. She was chatting with a top hat-wearing middle-
aged man with a thick black beard.
“Good afternoon, no. Good evening. It’s always night here. Klein, I
heard from Old Neil that you have become a Beyonder? It’s called
Seer?” Rozanne turned her head and deluged him with her questions.
She did not hide her curiosity and concern.
Klein nodded with a smile.
“Good afternoon, Miss Rozanne. It’s indeed always night here, but it
makes one feel a sense of serenity. The description you gave wasn’t
accurate enough. It should be said that the Sequence potion I
consumed has the name Seer.”
“You still chose to become a Beyonder after all…” Rozanne said with
a sigh as she fell into a deep thought.
Klein looked at the middle-aged man beside her and asked politely,
“You are?”
Another Nighthawk member or one of the other two civilian staﬀ I have
not met?
Rozanne puckered her lips and said, “Bredt. Our colleague. He wishes
to change slots with me to free up the night after tomorrow. He plans
on going to the theater in the North District with his wife to watch
The Prideful One. It’s to celebrate their ﬁfteenth-year wedding
anniversary. He’s truly a romantic gentleman.”
Bredt smiled as he extended his hand and said, “With Miss Rozanne
around, there’s nothing that requires repeating. Hello, Klein. I never
expected you to become a Beyonder so quickly. As for me, heh, I
might never have the courage.”
“Perhaps it’s as the saying goes, the ignorant knows no fear,” Klein
said in a self-deprecating manner as he extended his hand to shake
Bredt’s.
“Me not having courage is not something bad,” said Bredt with a
shake of his head. “A Beyonder once told me before his death to
never probe the strange and dangerous matters. The less you know,
the longer you live.”
At that moment, Rozanne interjected, “Klein, there’s no need to mind
it. I heard from Old Neil that as a Seer, you are used as support. It’s
relatively safe as long as you do not attempt to communicate with
unknown existences. Why are you dressed in such clothes? It’s so
unbecoming of a gentleman! What are you here for?”
“I’m here to draw my thirty bullets.” Klein did not reply to Rozanne’s
ﬁrst question.
He believed that the lady would quickly forget the matter.
“Alright.” Rozanne pointed at the table and said, “Bredt, it’s all yours.
You should know where the keys and bullets are. Oh, Old Neil really
is petty. He did not even leave his hand ground coﬀee behind. He
promised me that I could drink my ﬁll today…”
She prattled on as Klein received the bullets.
The duo left together and went their separate ways at Zouteland
Street. One took a public carriage home while the other walked into
the Shooting Club.
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Klein repeated the process—gripping the gun, raising his arms,
shooting, releasing the cylinder, ejecting the empty shells, and
stuﬃng in rounds—again and again. He became familiar with the
process and built it into his muscle memory.
Of course, he had a few breaks in between to review and correct the
process.
After ﬁnishing his practice, Klein used the grounds to do various
exercises like push-ups. He worked hard to train his body to improve
his physique.
Once everything was over, he sat in an untracked carriage home.
Only then he realized it was nearing seven and the sky was already
dark.
Just as Klein was planning to head to the market or streets to buy the
ingredients for dinner, the door opened. Melissa had returned with
her stationery-ﬁlled bag.
Apart from that, she carried quite a lot of groceries.
“…I thought you and Benson would be home rather late. This
morning, I took out 1 soli from the place you hide the money.” Upon
seeing her brother’s questioning look, Melissa explained in her usual
serious manner.
“Since you took the money, why didn’t you take the public carriage
to school?” Klein had been reminded of the matter from the morning.
Melissa said with a frown, “Why should I take a public carriage. It
costs four pence to get to school. A return trip means eight pence.
Counting Benson and you, we will be spending twenty-four pence on
transportation daily. That’s a whole soli! In a week, yes, without
counting Sunday, that’s still twelve pence. It’s almost equal to our
rent.”
Stop, stop, stop! Don’t ﬂaunt your mathematical prowess… Klein lowered
his palm in an amused manner.
Melissa ﬁrst stopped before adding, “It’s pretty good walking to
school. Our teacher said that everyone should exercise frequently.
Besides, I can pick some damaged components on the way.”
Klein chuckled and said, “Then let’s do the math again. The public
carriage costs twelve soli. The rent is twelve soli and three pence. It’s
a total of one pound, four soli and three pence. Using Benson’s salary
is enough to pay for it and there will be quite a bit of change left.
Yes, he has received last week’s salary… As for me, I can still earn
one pound ten soli every week. Even if we eat meat every day while
counting expenses like gas, charcoal, wood, and condiments, we
would still have some left if we are frugal with lunch. We can even
subscribe to the morning papers for just one penny.”
“In two months, when I make up for the advanced payment, I can
save money for both you and Benson. We can have new clothes.”
“But! But we have to think of the possible accidents.” Melissa stayed
ﬁrm on her point.
Klein smiled at her and said, “Then, we can eat less meat. Don’t you
ﬁnd spending ﬁfty, no, a hundred minutes on the road a waste of
time? You could use that time to read more and think over problems
and improve your results.
“That way, Melissa, you will be graduate with excellent grades. You
will be able to ﬁnd a job with a pretty good salary. When that
happens, what is there to worry about?”
“…”
He fully displayed his experience gained from debating with people
on message boards and ﬁnally convinced Melissa. She agreed to take
the public carriage to school.
“Phew, I’ve ﬁnally suckered her into doing it. No, how can I call it
suckering. This is called convincing…” Klein lampooned before
taking over the groceries that Melissa had bought. He said with a
sigh, “Remember to buy beef or meat like mutton and chicken… Eat
until you’re full and enjoy yourself. Only then will you be equipped
with a healthy body and a clever brain to match the demanding
requirements needed for your studies.”
Just mentioning it makes me salivate…
Melissa puckered her lips and after a few seconds of silence, said,
“Alright.”
…
The next morning, after ensuring that Melissa took a public carriage,
Klein and Benson separated and went to their respective companies.
The moment Klein stepped into the door, he saw Old Neil and
Rozanne chatting by the reception desk. The former was still in his
classic black robe, without any concern for the gazes of others. The
latter had changed into a casual cream-colored dress.
“Good morning, Mr. Neil, Miss Rozanne,” greeted Klein as he took oﬀ
his hat.
Old Neil gave him a mischievous look.
“Good morning, you did not hear anything you shouldn’t have heard
last night, right?”
“No, I slept very well.” Klein was also quite puzzled over that.
He could only put it down to his inadequate perception…
“Haha, don’t mind that. Actually, it’s not that easily heard.” Old Neil
pointed to the partition and said, “Go to the armory. We will
continue out mysticism lessons this morning.”
Klein nodded and followed Old Neil down the stairs and arrived at
the armory to replace Bredt who had been on duty the entire night.
“What will we be learning today?” asked Klein curiously.
Old Neil dragged out his response and said, “The complicated and
basic knowledge. But before that, let me teach you an interesting
trick.”
He pointed at the silver chain on his wrist. There was a pure
moonstone hanging from the chain.
Chapter 40: Mysticism
Curriculum
“An interesting trick?”
Klein asked out of extreme curiosity.
Old Neil chuckled and said, “I’ll complete my patrol of the armory,
storeroom, and archives. Use the two cups on the table to make two
cups of coﬀee. In one of the cups, put something unpleasant. As for
what it is, you can decide for yourself. Use your imagination. The
only request from me is to not waste too much coﬀee powder. Those
are coﬀee beans grown on the Feynapotter plateau and hand ground
by me!”
“Alright.” Although Klein was unsure what Old Neil was up to, he
happily agreed to it.
He watched him open the iron gates to the armory with a copper key
and then heard the echoing footsteps inside. Slowly, he settled the
cups down and conﬁrmed that there was still hot water in the kettle.
He removed the silver tin can’s lid and using a tiny spoon with a
metallic sheen, Klein scooped a spoonful of rich aromatic coﬀee
powder into each of the two cups. Then, he poured in the hot water
and stirred it.
As a transmigrator who came from an era abundant in resources, he
was no stranger to coﬀee. However, it was only limited to instant
coﬀee.
After ﬁnishing the task, Klein pondered for a moment and sat down.
He crossed his right leg and took some of the mud which had stained
the bottom of his leather boots and placed it in the left cup.
Then, he carefully stirred it again until the colors and smells of the
two cups of coﬀee were practically indistinguishable.
A few minutes later, Old Neil walked out the armory while swinging
his keys. He then closed the iron gates with a clang.
“Are you done?” His turned his slightly turbid dark red eyes over and
looked at Klein across the table.
“Yes,” replied Klein with a nod.
Old Neil chuckled and removed the silver chain around his wrist and
sat down.
His expression quickly turned serene. He held out his chain-holding
left hand and allowed it to hang over the coﬀee cup to his right. The
moonstone nearly touched the liquid.
Amid the relaxing calmness, the moonstone trembled suddenly. It
began spinning the chain in a counterclockwise manner.
“This cup is the one with the unpleasant thing,” said Old Neil surely.
Without waiting for Klein to conﬁrm, he put away the silver chain
and picked up the other cup of coﬀee and took a sip.
“Do you like bitter coﬀee? I’m used to having a tablespoon of sugar
and a tablespoon of milk.”
Klein did not reply but instead asked with his interest piqued, “Your
divination sure is accurate. Was it because of the moonstone? That
was moonstone, right?”
“This is known as pendulum dowsing in divination. It’s also called
spirit dowsing. It relies on your own Astral Projection’s connection
with the spirit world and space to communicate with spiritual
intelligence through the aid of natural materials such as crystals,
gems, or special metals. The good and bad of things can be divined…
Let’s talk about the two cups of coﬀee. A counterclockwise motion
implies bad, while a clockwise motion is good. If it doesn’t move, it’s
neither good or bad. You can write the statement on a piece of paper.
Take note, it’s a statement and not a question.” Old Neil put down
the cup of coﬀee and explained in detail.
Klein asked as though he was thinking, “Does that mean one should
use questioning sentences?”
“Yes, you cannot use “is so-and-so willing to be my ﬁancée,’ but you
should instead use ‘so-and-so is willing to be my ﬁancée.’ Write it on
a piece of paper and place it on the desk. Then use your dominant
hand to hold the pendulum chain. Take note, use your dominant
hand,” said Old Neil with a chuckle. “When doing so, keep your arm
straight. Adjust the chain’s length and make the moonstone hang just
above the piece of paper to the point of almost touching what we
wrote. Then, close your eyes and repeat the sentence seven times in
your mind. Open your eyes when you are done and see if the spirit
pendulum turns or not. If it doesn’t, close your eyes again and repeat
the process until it moves.”
Klein nodded slightly and asked, “Counterclockwise means ‘no,’ and
clockwise means ‘yes?'”
“It can also be interpreted as success or failure,” corrected Old Neil.
He taught Klein the other usages and details of spirit pendulum
divination.
Klein pondered over the matter and discovered that it was a very
useful divination trick. For instance, he could quickly use it in an
unfamiliar environment to determine if the food he was oﬀered was
poisonous or not. He did not need any additional knowledge of ﬁeld
biology.
Of course, such divination methods were overly simple. The answers
he could receive were limited to two or three. There was no way for
deeper investigation or interpretation. For example, although
something could be harmful to the body, it could become very
beneﬁcial after some processing. An example was certain foods. They
were indeed damaging to the body, but nothing serious. If one was
on the brink of starving, eating it would not be a huge problem.
These were things that spirit dowsing could not determine.
“I will have to quickly save money to buy crystals or pure silver to
create a spirit pendulum…” Klein sighed.
Old Neil looked at him in puzzlement.
“You can apply for one directly. This is standard issue for Beyonders,
especially Beyonders like us who take on a support role. There’s still
a topaz and pure silver spirit pendulum in the armory.”
“But I’m still not a formal member of the team…” Klein’s heart
palpitated in excitement, but he felt a little hesitant.
Old Neil chuckled and said, “For Beyonders, regardless of whether
they are formal members or not, they have to be provided with
conveniences in other areas since there’s no pay rise.”
“Maybe the word ‘perk’ is more suitable. I’ll apply with Captain
later!” Klein clenched his ﬁsts secretly as he made up his mind.
How was he to know if Captain would approve his request without trying?
“Alright,” said Old Neil with a smile. “We can oﬃcially begin our
mysticism curriculum. The basics consist of symbolism. Do you know
what symbolism means?”
Klein recalled the bits and pieces he had heard and the things he had
seen and heard from his spirit world and the gray fog. He deliberated
and said, “Regardless of the spirit world or the illusory stellar space,
as well as the unknown realms, they are beyond our sensory world.
It’s not something that can be accurately described by the
information our ears, nose, and eyes obtain. What we obtain are
simply indescribable experiences and direct revelations. They also
appear as abstract characters or pictorial symbols. These symbols
represent diﬀerent items and diﬀerent meanings.”
“Very accurate. As expected of a Seer.” Old Neil nodded solemnly.
“Only by grasping the ability to interpret the symbols can you really
take the next step into the world of mysticism. Yes, the pictures on
tarot cards and each of the elements in the pictures are symbols. They
are man-made symbols that help us understand and interpret
primordial revelations.”
He pulled out a piece of paper and picked up a fountain pen beside
him. He drew a short curve.
Following that, he added a few vertical lines beneath the curve. He
looked up at Klein and asked, “Do you know what this symbol
represents?”
Klein looked at it for quite a while before saying hesitatingly,
“Eyelashes?”
“…” Old Neil exhaled. “This is the symbol of the Bumper Harvest
constellation. This is the Thunderous constellation, and this is the
Frost constellation…”
He casually drew a few more symbols.
As Klein memorized them, he could not help but comment, “The
names of these constellations are really… especially unsophisticated.
Yes, unsophisticated!”
How tacky and primordial…
Old Neil revealed a smile.
“Emperor Roselle thought the same back then. He always had the
intention of changing the constellation names to things like Virgo,
Cancer, and Scorpio. Unfortunately, he did not have the strength to
go against tradition. At the very least, these constellations’ old names
and the corresponding dates they represent guide farming and
harvests.”
“I have to say that Emperor Roselle sure is a person with ideas.” Klein
was at a loss for words.
Yes, Emperor Roselle was likely a decent person when he was alive…
Old Neil was unable to understand Klein’s humor as he continued
explaining the various basic symbols, such as the various
constellations, the sun, the crimson moon, the brown star, the red
star, and the blue star.
While talking about these, he would teach Klein how to draw the
divination astrolabe and indicate what things to pay attention to. He
also taught the materials and creation of a crystal ball, and the choice
of incantations. The teachings overwhelmed Klein.
If not for his discovery that the Seer potion had improved his
memory slightly, he would have long asked Old Neil to stop to aid his
digesting of the information.
“That’s all for today’s mysticism class. Think over it yourself and ask
me if you have any questions.” Old Neil took out a gold pocket watch
and opened it with a snap to check the time. “Do not forget to read
the historical documents I prepared for you. To be frank, I feel fear
seeing them.”
“Alright.” Klein took the pieces of paper that were sketched with
symbols by Old Neil. He quickly went through the mysticism
knowledge he learned today to prevent himself from forgetting it.
Old Neil took a sip of a newly brewed cup of coﬀee and said,
“Memory itself won’t do. You have to use if often. That way, you can
make the knowledge instinctual. Also, Cogitation has to be carried on
every day. Only more practice and usage will allow you to grasp the
power of the potion, digging into the mysteries it hides away and
removing its unpleasant eﬀects.
With this raised, Klein recalled acting and the Divination Club. He
probed, “My potion’s abilities are related to divination. Practicing by
myself will not do. I need to make contact with lots of people and
divine for them to quickly grasp it. I plan on joining the Divination
Club after having some spare cash—the one on Howes Street in North
Borough—to become a real Seer.”
This was not something he could hide from the Nighthawks in the
future. It was better to prepare them.
“Your idea is very similar to Daly’s. She has always clamored to be a
real Spirit Medium.” Old Neil shook his head and laughed. “But why
must you wait till you have spare cash? You can apply to Dunn and
get him to approve of the expenses!”
“Organizations like a Divination Club might also have cultists or
members of evil organizations in them. As a civilian staﬀ member of
the Nighthawks and a standard Beyonder, your membership makes it
easy for us to monitor them. It’s part of the job! We would regularly
monitor these places, but as we lack manpower, we can’t keep watch
on them for long. Now, it can be handled to you.”
I can do that? As he looked at Old Neil’s serious expression, Klein was
dumbfounded.
This is making an expense claim for private matters!
I know nothing about such matters…
Indeed, I’m just a keyboard warrior…
“You wish to use your own money to do this?” Old Neil smiled as he
added when he saw Klein’s face.
Klein immediately shook his head as he answered ﬁrmly, “I plan on
reporting it to Captain!”
Old Neil nodded in satisfaction and looked at the cup of coﬀee with
the unpleasant thing inside. It had not been poured away.
“What did you put in there?”
Klein smiled embarrassingly.
“It’s just some dirt underneath my boots. Its color and your coﬀee
powder looks almost the same.”
Old Neil was taken aback as he suddenly clasped his mouth and
roared, “Why aren’t you pouring it away yet!?”
Chapter 41: Audrey and Her
Susie
After pouring away the coﬀee and returning to the armory to take the
thick stack of historical materials and explanatory transcripts from
Old Neil, Klein followed the wall of lights up the staircase to the
Blackthorn Security Company.
Tap. Tap. Tap. His footsteps echoed in the sealed and quiet basement.
After Klein left the spiral staircase, he pushed open the door and
identiﬁed his bearings before heading for the second oﬃce opposite
of him.
After familiarizing himself for two days, he had a general
understanding of the layout of the Blackthorn Security Company.
The entrance brought visitors to a huge reception hall with sofas and
tables. Through the partition, there was an inner region. To the left of
the corridor were three rooms. From the nearest to the furthest, they
were Mrs. Orianna’s account room, a rest room with a few sofa beds,
and the staircase that led underground.
On the right were three rooms. From the nearest to the furthest was
Captain Dunn Smith’s oﬃce, a civilian staﬀ oﬃce with a typewriter,
and the entertainment room for formal members of the Nighthawks
team.
Klein had previously seen Leonard Mitchell playing cards with two
other teammates in the entertainment room. He guessed that they
were playing Fighting the Landlord. Of course, Emperor Rochelle had
already given it a new name—Fighting Evil. However, the way it was
played was identical to what Klein knew.
Bredt was entitled to a day of sleep after a night shift. Rozanne was
at the reception desk. The carriage driver who was in charge of
procuring necessities and collecting supplies, Cesare Francis, was out
as usual. When Klein opened the door to the civilian staﬀ oﬃce, the
three desks inside were empty. Only the typewriter sat there silently.
“Akerson Company’s Model 1346 typewriter…” Klein, who had seen
similar objects in his mentor’s oﬃce and Welch’s place, muttered. He
felt that the complicated mechanisms inside were ﬁlled with the
beauty of machinery.
He walked to the desk with the typewriter. After preparing himself,
he attempted to type something on air.
In the beginning, he often converted the local language to Chinese
‘pinyin’ instinctively. Only after he was familiar with it did he ‘digest’
the original Klein’s corresponding memory fragment and no longer
made mistakes.
Tap! Tap! Tap!
The rhythmic tapping on the typewriter sounded like a melody
composed from the heavy marriage of metal and industry. Under this
melody, Klein quickly typed the expenditure application.
However, he was in no hurry to meet Dunn Smith. Instead, he
focused his mind and read the materials provided by Old Neil
seriously. It was both revision and new material.
When it was almost noon, he stretched his neck and put away the
documents. He then read and consolidated what he had learned on
mysticism in the morning.
Only after all that did he take his application to the oﬃce next door
and knocked on the door gently.
Dunn was waiting for lunch to be delivered. When he saw Klein hand
him the document, the corners of his mouth curved up.
“Did Old Neil teach you this?”
“Yes.” Klein did not hesitate to betray Old Neil.
Dunn picked up his dark red fountain pen and signed it.
“I happen to be applying for funding for the months of July, August,
and September from the Church and the police department. I’ll add
yours in. When it’s approved, get the money from Mrs. Orianna. You
can draw the spirit pendulum in the afternoon.”
“Alright,” Klein answered simply and vigorously.
His tone and eyes were obviously ﬁlled with joy.
Before bidding Dunn farewell, he asked casually, “Shouldn’t the
budget for July, August, and September be applied for by June?”
Why are you applying for July’s budget only in July?
Dunn fell silent for a few seconds before sipping his coﬀee.
“We encountered three cases in June. I was so busy that I forgot
about it.”
As expected of Captain and his poor memory… Klein knew he had
asked a question he should not have asked. He gave a chuckle before
leaving immediately.
With that, he began a simple but regular lifestyle. He would spend
half an hour in the early morning Cogitating. He would have two
hours of mysticism lessons in the morning and an hour and a half of
studying the historical documents. After lunch, he would take a short
nap in the break room to regain his energy.
Following that, he would draw bullets and head to the Shooting Club.
After ﬁnishing his practice, he would stroll over to Welch’s place,
which was not too far. He would then change routes and return to
Iron Cross Street. That way, he could save on the carriage fees. If he
had time, he would practice his Spirit Vision and Spirit Dowsing. On
the way, he would buy groceries.
…
In a private chemistry laboratory equipped with apparatus and items.
A tall, blond Audrey was looking at the cup in her hand. There were
countless bubbles and it made the atmosphere serene.
Finally, the liquid in the cup precipitated into a sticky silver
substance.
“Haha, I’m indeed talented in mysticism. I succeeded in one try! I
was worried of failure and prepared two sets of materials!” the girl
muttered to herself in delight.
She put away the items she took from her family’s vault or exchanged
them with others. She took a deep breath and prepared to close her
eyes to drink down the Spectator potion.
At that moment, barking sounded from outside the laboratory.
Audrey frowned instantly.
She hid the cup of silver liquid in a dark corner, turned around and
headed to the door.
“Susie, who’s here?” Audrey turned the doorknob and asked the
golden retriever sitting in front of the door.
Susie wagged her tail in an obsequious manner. Her personal
maidservant, Annie, had appeared in the corridor nearby.
Audrey walked out of the laboratory and closed the door. She looked
at Annie and said, “Didn’t I tell you? Do not disturb me when I’m
running chemistry experiments.”
A vexed Annie answered, “But there’s an invitation from the Duchess,
Duchess Della.”
“Duke Negan’s wife?” Audrey took a few steps forward and asked
Annie.
“Yes. She has managed to hire the services of the palace’s baker,
Madam Vivi, and plans to invite you and Madam to afternoon tea,”
Annie recounted the invitation.
Audrey tapped her cheeks discreetly and said, “Tell my mother that I
have a headache. Perhaps I’m a little dehydrated because of the
scorching sun. Please get her to convey my apologies to Madam
Della.”
As she spoke, she acted frail.
“Miss, it’s not only afternoon tea, but a literature salon,” added
Annie.
“But that won’t treat my dizziness. I need rest,” rejected Audrey
ﬁrmly.
Simultaneously, she muttered deep down. If they insist, I’ll faint for all
of you to see. The etiquette teacher said that I can do it most perfectly… I
think I heard something?
“Alright,” Annie exhaled and said. “Do you need me to help you back
to your room?”
“There’s no need. I’ll clean up the laboratory ﬁrst.” Audrey was
yearning to return immediately to consume the potion.
However, she suppressed her impatience. She only returned to the
laboratory’s entrance when she saw Annie leave.
Suddenly, she discovered that the golden retriever, Susie, who was
waiting outside, was gone. Furthermore, the door to the laboratory
was half opened.
“I forgot that Susie can open doors with handles… What was that
sound? Not good!” Audrey heard crisp sounds coming from within.
Suddenly, she came to a realization as she charged into the
laboratory.
All she could see was the cups shattered on the ﬂoor. Susie was
licking the ﬁnal drop of silver liquid.
Audrey stood rooted at the entrance like a statue.
Susie immediately sat down and looked at her owner innocently as
she wagged her tail.
…
In the seas beyond the Pritz Harbor, there was an island perennially
enveloped in storms. An ancient sailboat was docked at its harbor.
A blond man dressed in a robe with lightning patterns was looking at
Alger Wilson opposite to him. He asked, perplexed, “Alger, you could
have returned to the kingdom and become a captain of a Mandated
Punisher team or a reputable bishop. Why did you choose to voyage
out into sea and become the captain of the Blue Avenger?”
Alger wore a stoic expression on his rough face. He replied solemnly,
“The sea belongs to the Storm. This is the Lord’s kingdom. I’m willing
to abide by the Lord’s will and monitor this area of His kingdom.”
“Alright.” The blond haired man clenched his ﬁst and struck his
chest. “May the Storm be with you.”
“May the Storm be with you.” Alger replied with the same standard
salute.
He stood on the deck with a few sailors and watched his companions
leave the boat, walking into the distance.
“Sainz, you do not understand because you do not know enough…”
Alger muttered silently.
Meanwhile, Audrey ﬁnished her second concoction in a panic-
stricken state.
Seeing that the silver potion looked nothing diﬀerent from before,
she was nearly moved to tears.
Gulp. She quickly drank down the Spectator potion.
…
Friday. A storm befell Tingen. The heavy rain pounded on the
windows of every household.
Inside the Blackthorn Security Company, Klein, Rozanne, and Bredt
sat on the sofa in the reception hall and enjoyed lunch.
As there was only a kettle for boiling water, there was no way to heat
up leftovers. Klein could not eat rye bread every day or take the
carriage home every day. If he did that, he would have to walk from
Iron Cross Street to Welch’s place in the afternoon and consider
taking a carriage back. It was a waste of money; therefore, he began
joining Rozanne and his colleagues in eating the so-called ‘oﬃce
rations.’
The nearby Old Wills Restaurant would punctually send a waiter at
half past ten every day. He would ask for their orders and after
determining the quantity, he would send it over at half past twelve.
The food was contained in what resembled meal boxes. At three, he
would return to take their orders for dinner and take back the
utensils.
The ‘rations’ included meat, vegetables, and bread. Although the
quantity was lacking, it was barely suﬃcient to ﬁll a person. A cost of
a meal ranged from seven to ten pence depending on the diﬀerent
premium levels.
Klein would always thicken his skin and order the meal costing seven
pence. Typically, there was half a pound of wheat bread, a tiny piece
of meat cooked in diﬀerent ways, a ladle of thick soup with
vegetables, and tiny bits of butter or margarine.
“We actually only have one Nighthawk here today…” Rozanne said
as she delivered a spoonful of thick soup into her mouth.
“I heard that a case with cultist elements is going on in Golden Indus.
Therefore, the police department has requested for two
Nighthawks…” Bredt said as he put down his bread.
Klein used the remaining wheat bread and dabbed it into the last bits
of meat juice before stuﬃng it into his mouth. He did not say a word.
Under his left sleeve, there was a silver chain with a topaz hanging.
At that moment, knocks sounded outside the half-closed main door.
“…Please come in.” Rozanne was taken aback as she put down her
spoon. She quickly used a handkerchief to wipe her mouth and stood
up.
The door was pushed open as a man in a halved top hat came in. The
left shoulder of his black formal suit was drenched.
The sides of his hair had grayed. He put away his umbrella and said
to Klein and company, “Is this the former small mercenary squad?”
“You can say that,” answered Rozanne like clockwork.
The lanky man coughed and said, “I have a mission request.”
Chapter 42: Butler Klee
A mission request… You probably came to the wrong place… This
security company’s signboard is really nothing but a signboard…
Klein immediately held back his urge to lampoon when he heard the
visitor. How he yearned for there to be a message board and a screen
for him to share his thoughts.
But he soon realized that he had once asked a similar question. The
captain’s answer was that they could take on jobs if they were free.
The money earned could be used as funding for the team’s petty cash
account and bonuses for the participants.
Rozanne’s eyes darted around as she thought for a moment before
saying, “Our security personnel are all out on missions. The fastest it
will take for them to return is an hour. If your matter isn’t urgent,
you can consider our services.”
Among the six formal Nighthawk members, Captain Dunn Smith had
been invited to the cathedral by the bishop for some unknown
discussion. Leonard Mitchell was guarding Chanis Gate in his place.
Corpse Collector Frye and Sleepless Royale Reideen had already
headed to the Golden Indus Borough to assist the police in the
investigation of a robbery case with cultist inklings. Sleepless Kenley
White was on leave, while Midnight Poet Seeka Tron had gone to
Raphael Cemetery in the north suburb for a daily patrol.
As for the remaining two Beyonders, Old Neil was frail and too
advanced in his years. He had not taken any missions in a long time.
Klein was still a novice and was truly inadequate in various aspects.
“They are all out…” With one hand holding his umbrella, the lanky
man’s expression turned gloomy as he took oﬀ his hat. He bowed and
said, “Sorry for intruding. Goodbye.”
He turned around and walked out. He went down the stairs and left
36 Zouteland Street amid the spattering rain and howling winds.
“What a bloody pity.” Rozanne watched the man left and sighed
regretfully.
Although she would not have gotten any share of the commission,
she deﬁnitely would have been able to partake in a sumptuous meal.
“There’s nothing we can do about it. Chanis Gate needs someone
watching it all the time.” Klein put down his cutlery in satisfaction.
Even though he did not like the soup mixture of turnips and
vegetables, he still drank it clean. “Don’t tell me you want Bredt to
take the mission? Or yourself?”
Rozanne rolled her eyes and giggled.
“Bredt won’t do, but you can. Our Mister Seer…”
The moment she ﬁnished her sentence, she immediately realized
what she had just said. She covered her mouth in shock because the
door had not been fully closed. It someone walked past outside or
heard anything about Beyonders, it would be considered a leak.
“Thankfully Captain isn’t around…” Rozanne looked out the door and
secretly stuck her tongue out. “Or I’ll have to go for confession
again!”
Bredt and Klein laughed out in unison as they exchanged looks before
beginning to put away the cutlery.
After everything was done, Klein, who did not bring his umbrella,
decided to stay at Blackthorn Security Company due to the ongoing
rain.
He took out some newspapers and sat on the soft but bouncy sofa as
he leisurely began his ‘afternoon break.’
“The airship route from Backlund to Desi Bay is now in service…”
“The complete anthology of the Great Detective Manseng is
publishing soon…”
“An advertisement for Lagolas Weapons? A standard model revolver
carrying six bullets costs three pounds and ten soli, a double barrel
gun costs two pounds…”
…
Klein ﬂipped through the Tingen City Honest Paper when a particular
piece of news suddenly caught his attention.
“…the suspect responsible for killing Mr. Welch and Miss Naya has
been caught. We believe it is a much-needed reprieve from the horror
that has gripped North Borough, Golden Indus Borough, and East
Borough… Welch’s father, Mr. McGovern, who is a banker, has
escorted his youngest son’s corpse back to Constant City where a
grand burial will be held…”
After reading it a few times, Klein suddenly sighed.
From the looks of it, Welch’s father had bought the police’s explanations
and did not hire a private investigator to investigate the matter…
His grief from losing his youngest son can’t be any greater than that of my
parents who lost their only son…
In a sullen mood, Klein sat there motionless for a long time.
He neither found it odd that he was not invited to Welch’s and Naya’s
burials, nor did he feel depressed.
Once everything calms down, I’ll ﬁnd a chance to oﬀer a bouquet of
ﬂowers to their graves… Klein was about to take a nap in the break
room when a knock came from the door of the reception hall again.
“Please come in.” Rozanne, who was nodding oﬀ, suddenly jolted
awake.
The half-closed door was pushed open again. The lanky man from
before walked in once again.
“Can I wait here? Your mercenaries, no— security personnel should
be back soon, right?” He asked sincerely, trying his best to hide his
anxious expression.
“Sure. Please have a seat.” Rozanne pointed at the sofa nearby.
Klein asked out of curiosity, “Where did you hear about our security
company? Who introduced you here?”
He had made two trips despite the heavy afternoon storm while still
willing to wait?
Yes. The Nighthawks must have easily resolved missions that might seem
very diﬃcult to others. They must have accrued quite a reputation…
The man left his umbrella outside the door and as he walked to the
sofa, he replied with a rueful smile, “I have traveled the nearby
streets and paid a visit to all the mercenaries, uh—security companies
and private investigators. You are my only hope. The others do not
have the manpower to take additional missions… To be frank, if not
for the waiter that delivers meals, I really did not imagine that there
was another security company here.”
…It’s completely diﬀerent from what I imagined… Klein was stunned.
Rozanne interjected with a question, “They are very busy? Are there
that many missions?”
The man sat down and sighed.
“You are a mercenary team, no—a security company. I believe you
must have heard of the armed burglary murder at Howes Street?”
Howes Street… Armed burglary murder… Alright, unfortunately, I’m one
of the people involved… Klein nodded with a slightly heavy heart.
“Yes.”
“Due to the presence of a ferocious and cruel criminal, the rich men
living in the neighboring streets, and even across all of Tingen City,
are terriﬁed. Apart from increasing the numbers of their security
detail, they have also hired many more security personnel and
private detectives. This resulted in a shortage of supply in your line
of work,” the tall and skinny man explained clearly.
A standard chain-reaction… Klein and Rozanne exchanged looks and
saw the self-deprecating smile from each other’s faces.
The security industry had entered a golden age. Yet, Blackthorn
Security Company was not aﬀected in any way. It was apparent how
dismally the company was run.
Of course, to a certain extent, it also proved the success of the
Nighthawks in hiding themselves.
After waiting for another twenty plus minutes, Klein prepared to
leave since the rain was coming to a stop. He planned on practicing
at the Shooting Club.
At that moment, the black-haired and green-eyed Leonard Mitchell
walked out of the partition. He looked curiously at the sofa.
“This is?”
“A client. Is Captain back?” Rozanne asked delightfully.
“Back?” The lanky man was taken aback when he heard that.
He had been sitting there, staring at the door. How did he not
discover someone’s return?
Rozanne’s expression immediately froze as she chuckled.
“As a security company, we don’t only use the front door.”
“Figures.” The lanky man nodded in enlightenment.
He was also not surprised by the term ‘Captain.’ Security companies
were mercenary teams or small-scale mercenary guilds. It was normal
for ‘Captain’ to be used.
Leonard did not tuck in his white shirt. His black vest was also
casually draped on. He took a glance at the lanky man when he
suddenly snapped his ﬁngers and said, “I’m a member of the security
personnel at Blackthorn. How might I address you? How may I help
you?”
Perhaps it was because he had long heard about the unrestrained
characters of mercenaries that he did not feel the anger of being
humiliated. Instead, he let out a breath of relief.
He watched Leonard sit down, and organized his words.
“My name is Klee, a butler of Mr. Vickroy, a tobacco merchant. His
only son, little Elliott, was kidnapped this morning. We have already
informed the police and the matter has been given high priority.
However, Mr. Vickroy remains uneasy. He wishes to go through the
channels which mercenaries, uh—security personnel have, as well as
your understanding of Tingen, to investigate the case from a diﬀerent
angle and ensure that little Elliott is rescued safely.”
“If you are able to ﬁnd where the kidnappers are hiding, Mr. Vickroy
will be willing to pay you 100 pounds. If you have the means to
successfully save Young Master Elliott, he is willing to pay double.
200 pounds.”
Leonard Mitchell smiled leisurely.
“Mr. Vickroy seems to only wish for us to ﬁnd the kidnappers’
hideout? If not, he will not think that his only son is worth a hundred
pounds. A tobacco merchant who has close ties with the southern
plantations will not just oﬀer two hundred pounds.”
“No, Mr. Vickroy is only an ordinary merchant. He’s not considered
wealthy. Besides, he believes the police will be more professional
when it comes to rescuing his son,” Klee answered frankly.
“Alright. No problem.” Leonard snapped his ﬁngers again.
His green eyes turned their gaze on Rozanne.
“My beautiful lady, please write up a contract.”
“Don’t always act like a poet. In fact, all you do is recite the works of
others.” Having forgotten the presence of the client, Rozanne
quipped. She was used to exchanging snipes with Leonard.
Of course, the Blackthorn Security Company did not really care about
its clients. It was great to have them, but it was also ﬁne not having
them.
Rozanne left the reception counter and entered the staﬀ oﬃce. Soon,
there were sounds of typing coming out from the oﬃce.
The corners of Klein’s mouth twitched a little. He found them too
unprofessional.
There was no standard template for a contract!
This sure is tragic…
And more saddening is the fact that I’m working at such an unprofessional
company…
The moment these thoughts arose in him, Rozanne completed a
simple contract that had only a few clauses. Then, Klee and Leonard
Mitchell signed it.
After Klee stamped it, she took the contract and returned to the
accounting room and got Mrs. Orianna to stamp it with the
Blackthorn Security Company logo—something that was actually
useless. Dunn typically handed it to Orianna for safekeeping. On
Sunday, it would be passed to Rozanne and company.
“I’ll wait for your good news.” After receiving one copy of the
contract, Klee stood up and bowed with his hat oﬀ.
Leonard did not respond. He seemed to be in deep thought.
He suddenly turned his head toward Klein and revealed a smile.
“I need your help.”
“Ah?” Klein was taken aback.
“I mean you and I can ﬁnish this mission together.” The corners of
Leonard’s mouth curved up slightly as he explained, “I’m good at
combat, shooting, climbing, sensing, and chanting, and taking on
some support roles. But that does not include looking for people. You
don’t expect Old Neil to go out in such weather, right?”
When he said ‘sensing,’ his voice was lowered to a mumble that Klein
could barely hear.
“Alright.” Klein did have the urge to attempt his new ‘abilities,’ while
also feeling a little wary toward Leonard Mitchell.
Phew. Let’s hope it will be completed successfully… I wonder how useful
my Seer abilities will be… He wondered with some anticipation.
Chapter 43: Search
While looking at Klein, Leonard smiled and nodded.
“Then, do you need anything from them?”
He had cooperated with Old Neil and company numerous times, so
he naturally knew that divination required a medium, especially
when the person being divined was not present.
Klein thought for a moment before saying to Klee, “I need some of
Elliott’s recent clothes which have not been washed or starched. It
would be better if you have any accessories he used to wear on him.”
He tried to choose ordinary mediums, not something that would
normally invite questions.
But even so, Klee wore a look of puzzlement.
“Why?”
After his question, he added, “I have a picture of Young Master Elliott
on me.”
Why? Because we are divining his location… Klein was momentarily
at a loss for an answer.
If he answered truthfully, ignoring the fact that it violated the
conﬁdentiality clause, Klee would likely storm out immediately and
rip apart the contract while cursing, “This bunch of cheats! If that
works, why don’t I ﬁnd the most famous Spirit Medium in Awwa
County!”
By the side, Leonard Mitchell chuckled and said, “Mr. Klee, my
partner, um—colleague rears a unique pet. Its sense of smell is
sharper than a hound’s. That’s why we need clothes that little Elliott
wore and items he used to wear on him to aid us in ﬁnding him. As
you know, clues typically bring you to a general region.”
“As for the picture, we would need it too. Both of us need to know
what little Elliott looks like.”
Klee accepted the reason by nodding slowly.
“Will you be waiting here, or will you be going with me to Mr.
Vickroy’s residence in the city?”
“Let’s go together. It saves time,” replied Klein simply.
Not only was he eager to try out his abilities as a Beyonder, but he
also wanted to save the child.
“Alright, the carriage is downstairs.” As Klee spoke, he took out a
black-and-white photograph and handed it to Leonard.
It was a picture of Elliott Vickroy alone. He was about ten years old
with rather long hair that nearly covered his eyes. There were
obvious freckles on his face and he did not seem to stand out.
Leonard glanced at it and handed it to Klein.
Klein took a careful look and placed the photograph into his pocket.
Then, he took his cane and put on his hat. He followed the two out of
Blackthorn Security Company and boarded the carriage downstairs.
The carriage’s interior was rather spacious. It was lined with thick
carpet and a tiny table to rest items on.
As Klee was around, Klein and Leonard did not say a word. They
quietly took in the experience of traversing the pooling roads in a
carriage.
“The carriage driver is quite good.” Leonard broke the silence after
some time with praise and a smile.
“Yeah.” Klein answered perfunctorily.
Klee forced a smile and said, “Your compliments are his honor. We
will be there soon…”
As they were afraid of alerting the kidnappers, the carriage did not
stop at the Vickroy’s residence. Instead, it stopped at the side of a
nearby street.
Klee held an umbrella and returned along. After waiting for some
time, Leonard talked to Klein again.
“My surmise the last time was not without a goal. I was just trying to
tell you that the notebook will deﬁnitely appear again. Perhaps, it
might be soon.”
“That really isn’t a happy surmise.” Klein used his chin to gesture
towards the carriage driver outside, indicating that he did not wish to
discuss sensitive topics with outsiders around.
Leonard whistled and turned his head to look out the window. He
saw raindrops streak across the glass, leaving behind blurry marks. It
made the world outside a complete blur.
After a while, Klee returned with a bag of items. Since he walked in a
hurry, the edge of his trousers were soiled and his shirtfront was
slightly wet.
“These are the clothes Young Master Elliott wore yesterday. This is
the Storm Amulet he used to wear.”
Klein took it and glanced at it. He discovered it to be a miniature
gentleman’s formal suit—a small shirt, vest, bow tie, etc.
And the Storm Amulet was made of bronze. It was carved with
symbols representing gales and sea waves, but they did not trigger
Klein’s perception.
“I’ll recount in detail the incidents leading up to Young Master
Elliott’s kidnapping. Hopefully, it will let you ﬁnd him easier…” Klee
sat down and described the nightmare that happened in the morning,
hoping that the helpers he went through great trouble to hire would
be of help.
Klein and Leonard held no interest in the speciﬁcs. All they cared
about was the number of kidnappers, if anything unusual had
happened, or if they had any weapons.
“Three,” “normal,” “armed with ﬁrearms…” After obtaining the
desired information, they bade Klee farewell and hired a two-wheeled
light carriage.
Unlike public carriages, private-hire carriages were either four-
wheeled or two-wheeled. They were charged either by time or
distance. The latter was at four pence a kilometer in the city and
eight pence a kilometer outside. The former cost two soli per hour or
part thereof. After the ﬁrst hour, there were additional charges of six
pence every ﬁfteen minutes. In inclement weather or if the customer
needed to go faster, the fare could even be higher.
Klein had heard from Azik that in the capital, Backlund, these
carriage drivers were famous for quoting outrageous prices.
To him, taking a private carriage was quite a luxury. However, he did
not need to worry about this at the moment since Leonard had tossed
two one-soli notes to the carriage driver.
“Charge it by the time.” After Leonard gave his instructions, he
closed the carriage’s door.
“Where are you going?” The carriage driver was delighted and
puzzled as he held the two notes.
“Wait a moment.” Leonard cast his gaze at Klein.
Klein nodded slightly and took out Elliott’s clothes. He spread it out
on the carriage’s ﬂoor and then wound the Storm Amulet around his
cane’s handle.
He held the silver-inlaid black cane and hung it straight over Elliott’s
clothes.
He gathered the sphere of light in his head as his mind rapidly turned
still. His brown eyes quickly turned deeper in color as he entered a
half-Cogitation state.
He felt the his body’s “spirit” turning light. He vaguely saw the world
of spirits everywhere. He silently said, “Elliott’s location.”
After repeating it seven times, he released his grip of the black cane,
but the cane did not fall to the ground. It remained standing in front
of him even though the carriage was shaking!
Minute but invisible stirrings happened around Klein and he felt as if
pairs of eyes were looking at him.
Over the past few days, Klein had felt this sensation occasionally
when he was in the state of Cogitation or Spirit Vision.
With a little fear, he looked at the cane with his deep black eyes. He
recited once again in his heart, “Elliott’s location.”
“Elliott’s location.”
After he ﬁnished saying that, the cane fell and pointed straight ahead.
“Straight.” Klein held the cane and said in a deep voice.
His voice sounded a little ethereal as though it could penetrate the
unknown world.
This was one of the divination abilities he had grasped. It was called
“Dowsing Rod Seeking.” The tool of choice had to be wooden,
metallic, or a mixture of both.
In ordinary circumstances, he would require two real dowsing rods.
Dowsing rods were shaped like two straight metal wires tapered to an
edge. He would hold on to the shorter side and turn it to ascertain
the correct direction. But as a Seer, Klein realized that through
practice, he could search for people directly using this method. He
could also use his cane as a replacement for dowsing rods. The
direction in which the cane fell was the direction of the item he was
seeking.
As for the Antigonus family’s notebook, Klein could not remember it
at all. Without the slightest impression, there was no way for him to
ﬁnd it.
“Go straight.” Leonard instructed the carriage driver loudly. “We will
tell you when there’s a need to turn.”
The carriage driver did not understand why that was necessary, but
the notes in his pocket and the willingness of his passengers to hand
over the money kept him quiet. He chose to follow the strange
instructions.
The carriage proceeded slowly, passing through one street after
another.
Midway, Klein used Dowsing Rod Seeking to correct their direction.
After the carriage circled a building once, he ﬁnally determined that
Elliott was inside. It had only been thirty minutes since they bade
Klee farewell.
After sending oﬀ the cane, Klein did not continue using Elliott’s
clothes. Instead, he placed the cane, entwined with the Storm Amulet
directly onto the ground.
His eyes turned dark once again as the raindrops around him
suddenly spun in place.
The cane fell to the front with a slant. Klein pointed at the staircase
and said, “There.”
“At times, I really envy Old Neil. Similarly, I envy you now.” Upon
seeing this scene, Leonard smiled with a sigh.
Klein shot him a glance and replied with a calm tone, “This is
nothing diﬃcult. If you are willing to learn, you would deﬁnitely be
able to master it… Your perceptivity should be very high, right?”
Leonard nodded and chuckled.
“That’s not something good.”
He quickened his pace and walked into the building amid the ending
rain.
Klein was afraid of drenching his formal suit, so he jogged in tow.
The building only had three stories. It was similar to a unit block
from Earth. The entrance to each ﬂoor was situated along the ﬂight
of stairs. There were only two units on per ﬂoor. Klein used Dowsing
Rod Seeking on both the ﬁrst and second ﬂoors, but the cane
remained still while pointing upward.
The two of them quieted their footsteps and arrived at the third ﬂoor.
Klein once again placed the black cane on the ﬂoor.
Whoosh!
A breeze blew across the stairs as his pupils changed colors. The
darkness seemed like it could suck the souls of people.
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Sobs seemed to sound out around them.
Klein relaxed his palm as the cane with the entwined Storm Amulet
magically stood erect.
He silently read “Elliott’s location” again. He watched his black cane
drop silently as it pointed to the right room.
“They should be in there.” While Klein picked up his cane, he tapped
his glabella twice.
Various colors saturated as he looked at the right room. He saw all
sorts of auras inside.
“One, two, three, four… Three kidnappers and one hostage. The
numbers match… One of their auras is short. It’s likely Elliott… Mr.
Klee said that they have two hunting riﬂes and a revolver…” Klein
whispered.
Leonard chuckled.
“Let me recite a poem for them.”
“Why be a kidnapper? Why can’t you happily be civilized person?”
He put down the bag with Elliott’s clothes and took two steps
forward. His expression suddenly turned serene and melancholic.
His magnetic and deep voice gradually sounded.
“Oh, the threat of horror, the hope of crimson cries!
“One thing at least is certain—that this Life ﬂies;
“One thing is certain, and the rest is Lies;
“The Flower that once has bloomed forever dies…”
Chapter 44: Fate
Leonard’s singing sounded like a lullaby as it lightly resounded
through the doors and into the winding wooden stairwell.
Klein’s mind immediately turned torpid. He felt like he saw a silent
moonlight and serene rippling lake.
His eyelids rapidly turned heavy as if he were about to fall asleep
standing.
Amid these indistinct sensations, he also felt a strange, formless, and
indiﬀerent focus on his back. It felt like he was wandering the spirit
world himself.
A baﬄing sense of déjà vu suﬀused as Klein suddenly found his train
of thought once again. With his strong spiritual perception and
extreme familiarity with Cogitation, he barely escaped the inﬂuence
of the Midnight Poem.
However, he remained serene and could hardly evoke any emotions.
Soon, Leonard stopped singing as he turned his head with a smile.
“I’m considering asking Captain’s permission to apply for a
Feynapotter lute. How can there not be an accompaniment when
singing?
“Heh heh, I’m just kidding. I can hear them asleep.”
The black-haired, green-eyed Nighthawk with his poetic vibe took a
stride forward and walked to the door that separated them from the
kidnappers and hostage.
He suddenly moved his shoulder and threw a punch at the door’s
lock.
Crack!
The wooden board around the lock shattered in a muﬄed manner.
“This requires precise control.” Leonard turned his head and smiled.
He then reached his hand into the hole and opened the door.
Klein, who had regained consciousness, was not as conﬁdent as him.
He reached under his armpit, drew his revolver, and turned the
cylinder, making sure that he could shoot at a moment’s notice.
As the door swung back, he saw a man sleeping on a table with a gun
by his feet. Another man was rubbing his eyes in a daze while trying
to stand up.
Bam!
Leonard slid forward and struck the awakening kidnapper
unconscious.
Klein planned to enter as well when he suddenly sensed something.
He turned around abruptly and faced the stairwell.
Tap. Tap. Tap. Footsteps were approaching from below. It became
clear that “something” was a hatless man in a brown coat circling the
stairwell in his progression toward the third ﬂoor while hugging a
paper bag of bread.
Suddenly, he stopped. He saw a gun’s barrel aiming at him with a
metallic luster.
His pupils reﬂected a young man dressed in a halved top hat, black
formal suit with a bow tie of the same color. It also reﬂected the cane
which rested along the rail and the dangerous revolver.
“Do not move. Raise your hands. Three, two, one…” Klein’s tone was
deep but relaxed.
He held the revolver with both hands as he tried to imagine the man
as a target from his practice.
Amid the tense atmosphere, the man in the brown coat threw the bag
of bread and slowly raised his hands.
“Sir, is this a kind of a joke? Has there been a misunderstanding?” He
stared intently at the ﬁnger that Klein had placed on the trigger as he
forced a smile.
Klein was temporarily unable to determine if he was an accomplice
or a neighbor, but he did not reveal any abnormalities. He said in a
deep voice, “Do not attempt to resist. Someone will determine if it’s a
misunderstanding in a while.”
At that moment, Leonard, who had ﬁnished handling the kidnappers,
walked out and noticed the man in the stairwell. He said leisurely,
“So the kidnappers have another accomplice responsible for buying
and delivering food?”
Upon hearing this, the man’s pupils constricted as he suddenly raised
his foot and kicked the bag of bread up in an attempt to block Klein’s
vision.
Seemingly unaﬀected, Klein coldly pulled the trigger like his usual
training.
Bang!
Blood burst out from the man’s left shoulder.
He tumbled to the ground and attempted to escape from the second
ﬂoor; however, Leonard had already reached his hand towards the
handrail before leveraging himself to jump over.
With a dull thud, Leonard landed on the man from above.
The man fainted as Leonard swatted away some of the blood that had
splattered on him. He looked up at Klein and chuckled.
“Nice shooting.”
I was trying to hit his legs… The corner of Klein’s mouth twitched in an
indiscernible manner as he caught a whiﬀ of the smell of blood.
He discovered that despite not having any enhancements to his
visual, auditory, or tactile senses after consuming the Seer potion, he
could still “see” obstructed objects and “hear” faint footsteps,
allowing him to take preemptive judgment.
Was this in the scope of spiritual perception? Klein nodded in thought as
he watched Leonard ﬁnd a sharp dagger in the accomplice’s
possession and “drag” him into the room.
With a gun and cane in each hand, Klein entered the kidnapper’s
room. They saw Elliott Vickroy jolt awake from the gunshot as he
straightened his body and sat up slowly from a huddled position.
Leonard had securely tied up the three kidnappers with the rope they
used against Elliott. Bunched together, they were thrown in a corner.
The lack of rope was made up by tearing their clothes.
The unconscious man who had been shot in the shoulder was
bandaged, but Leonard disdained getting his hands dirty, so he did
not help him extract the bullet.
“W-who are you people?” Elliott stammered in pleasant delight when
he saw the scene before him.
“Yes, you guessed right. Very precise.” The genuﬂecting Leonard
answered casually.
I never expected this bastard to have some humor cells in him… Klein
lowered his revolver and said to Elliott, “We are mercenaries hired by
your father. You can also call us security personnel.”
“Phew, for real? Have I been saved?” Elliott said joyfully without
daring to make any movements.
It was apparent that he had suﬀered quite harshly in the short few
hours of being a kidnapping victim. He did not have the kind of
rashness someone his age normally would have.
Leonard stood up and said to Klein, “Go downstairs and ﬁnd some
patrolling cops. Get them to inform the tobacco merchant. I do not
wish to walk out with a child and four idiots like a kidnapper.”
Klein, who was wondering about the aftermath, nodded. He put away
his revolver, picked up his cane, and walked to the staircase.
As he went down the stairs, he had a nagging feeling that he had
forgotten something. In addition, he heard Leonard say to Elliott,
“Don’t be nervous. You will soon see your father, mother, and your
old butler, Klee. Why don’t we play a round of Quint?”
…
Klein held back his laughter and walked out into the streets. With the
help of pedestrians, he found two patrolling policemen.
He did not use his badge and identiﬁcation as a member of the
Special Operations Department; instead, he used his identity as a
professional security company and recounted the happenings
factually.
As for him holding a gun, he was not worried at all. He had received
an all-purpose weapon usage certiﬁcate the day before yesterday. His
application was accelerated by going through internal channels.
The two policemen exchanged looks and one of them left to gather
reinforcements and inform the Vickroy family. The other policeman
followed Klein to the kidnappers’ room.
After waiting for more than forty minutes, Leonard signaled to Klein
while the policeman was not paying attention. Klein was to sneak out
of the room with him.
“Trust me, heading to the police station is an extreme waste of time.
Let’s leave ﬁrst,” the Nighthawk with the poetic bearing explained
with a relaxed look.
Since Leonard was making it clear that he would take any
responsibility for any repercussions, he did not retort and followed in
tow.
Almost ﬁve minutes later, a few carriages rushed to the building
where the kidnappers were. The old butler, Klee, disembarked with
his portly master, Vickroy.
Up to this moment in time, he was still in a daze. He found it
incredulous that news would come so fast. It felt like a dream.
Suddenly, he heard a crisp snap as he turned around.
A two-wheeled carriage drove past with its windows open. The black-
haired and green-eyed Leonard had snapped his ﬁngers again.
After passing by Vickroy’s carriage, Leonard closed the window,
turned around, and looked at Klein.
He extended his right hand and smiled.
“It was a pleasure working with you!”
I don’t think we are on that good terms… Klein politely shook his head.
He did not expect the kidnapping case to be resolved so quickly. All
he could do was marvel at the capabilities of Beyonders. Even though
he was just a half-assed Sequence 9 Beyonder, he was able to do
many inconceivable things.
“This is a celebratory gesture of peace among aristocrats after a clash
of swords,” explained Leonard with a smile.
“I know.” Klein had many aristocratic classmates.
He looked outside the window and said with a frown, “Shouldn’t we
conﬁrm with Mr. Klee? If he believes that the police rescued Elliott,
our commission will be halved.”
A total of 100 pounds!
There was no doubt about their providing of the kidnappers’ location
from their ‘meeting’ from before.
“Don’t mind it. To us, money isn’t that important,” said Leonard with
a shrug.
…It’s very important to me!
Klein forced a polite smile and said, “Many poets died early from
poverty.”
Leonard chuckled.
“I believe Elliott would not lie on this matter. I can tell that he still
has some of his innocence left in him. However, you will not get
much of the 200 pound commission either.”
“How much would I get?” asked Klein immediately.
“As the unspoken rule has always been, half of the commission would
be handed to Mrs. Orianna as additional funding for the team. The
remaining would be split among members. A pity you aren’t a formal
member; you will only get about ten percent of the remaining half.”
10 pounds? That isn’t bad either… Klein pretended to feel the pinch as
he asked, “Aren’t you worried that the kidnappers will realize that
they were under the inﬂuence of a Beyonder’s powers after they wake
up?”
“They will not suspect anything. They will only believe that the
weather was good and very conducive for sleeping, leading to them
dozing oﬀ. They will even believe that the song existed only in their
dreams. This is something we have veriﬁed before,” answered
Leonard very conﬁdently. “Instead, it’s your demon hunting bullets
that might arouse suspicion. Of course, you being a queer who enjoys
mysticism would be a perfectly reasonable explanation.”
“I see.” Klein was relieved. He just kept feeling like he had forgotten
or overlooked something.
…
After returning to Zouteland Street, Klein did not wait for Klee’s
arrival. He strolled to Welch’s place and took a diﬀerent route home.
On the way, he bought some beef and olives for dinner.
The meal was enjoyable as always, with the same three siblings
chatting idly. However, there was an additional visitor.
He was a worker responsible for collecting one penny for the gas
meter.
The evening grew dark as the siblings bade each other good night
and returned to their rooms.
Klein was sleeping soundly when he was suddenly awoken by
something familiar outside. He opened the door in puzzlement and
arrived outside the bedroom that no one stayed in.
He pushed open the mottled door and saw a gray desk.
There was a notebook on the table and its cover was made of hard
paper. It was completely black in color.
A baﬄing sense of déjà vu arose in him as he walked over and
opened the notebook.
The page he ﬂipped open to was of a picture—a picture of someone
dressed in gorgeous clothes and splendid headdress—The Fool!
Beneath The Fool was a line in Hermes.
“Everyone will die, including me.”
Horror gripped Klein’s heart as he suddenly realized that the corner
of The Fool’s mouth was curving up!
Fﬀﬀﬀf!
He sat up in shock as he saw crimson moonlight penetrate his
curtains. He saw his bookshelf and desk and the silhouette of his own
bedroom. He realized that he had had a nightmare.
As a Seer, he knew what dreams typically portend. Therefore, he
began to seriously search through his recollections.
Klein froze up when he did because he knew what he had missed out
on today!
While he was immersed in Leonard’s singing, he had sensed a
formless and indiﬀerent focus on his back.
The feeling of being observed felt diﬀerent from the usual Cogitation
or experience he had from using Spirit Vision. It gave him a sense of
déjà vu!
According to Captain Dunn, once a feeling of déjà vu arose in him, it
probably means…
Klein suddenly sat straight and conﬁrmed the feeling.
Yes, it’s that notebook! That Antigonus family’s notebook!
Chapter 45: Returning
The Antigonus notebook is in the apartment across the kidnappers’!
Although it was very coincidental, Klein believed that his intuition
was correct.
He immediately got out of bed and rapidly changed out of the old
clothes he usually wore to bed. He picked up a white shirt beside him
and draped it on, quickly buttoning from top to bottom.
One, two, three… He suddenly realized that he was “missing”
buttons. The left and right sides did not seem to match.
On careful look, Klein realized that he had made a mistake buttoning
the ﬁrst button, causing the shirt to warp.
He shook his head helplessly before taking a deep breath and slowly
breathing out, using some of his Cogitation techniques to restore his
calm.
After putting on his white shirt and black trousers, he barely
managed to wear his armpit holster steadily. He pulled out the
revolver he hid under his soft pillow and holstered it.
Without time to tie a bow tie, he draped his formal suit on and with a
hat and cane in each hand, he walked to the door. After putting on
his halved top hat, Klein gently twisted the door handle and walked
into the corridor.
He carefully closed his bedroom’s wooden door and sneaked
downstairs like a thief. He used a fountain pen and paper in the
living room to leave a note, informing his siblings that he had
forgotten to mention that he had to be early for work today.
The moment he was out the door, Klein felt a cool breeze and his
entire being calmed down.
The street in front of him was dark and silent without any
pedestrians. Only the gas lamps illuminated the streets.
Klein took out his pocket watch from his pocket and snapped it open.
It was just six in the morning and the crimson moonlight had not
completely faded away. However, there was a hue of sunrise over the
horizon.
He was just about to seek out an expensive for-hire carriage when he
saw a two-horse, four-wheeled trackless carriage approaching him.
“There are public carriages this early in the morning?” Klein was
puzzled as he went forward and waved for it to stop.
“Good morning, Sir.” The carriage driver stopped the horses
skillfully.
The ticketing oﬃcer beside him had his hand to his mouth while
yawning.
“To Zouteland Street.” Klein scooped out two pennies from his pocket
and four halfpence.
“Four pence,” the ticketing oﬃcer replied without any hesitation.
After paying for the ride, Klein got onto the carriage and found it
empty. It exuded a clear loneliness amid the dark night.
“You are the ﬁrst one,” said the carriage driver with a smile.
The two brown horses widened their pace as they proceeded briskly.
“To be honest, I never imagined there to be a public carriage so early
in the morning.” Klein sat near the carriage driver and made idle
chatter to divert his attention and relax his tense mind.
The carriage driver said in a self-deprecating manner, “From six in
the morning to nine at night, but all I earn is one pound a week.”
“Are there no breaks?” inquired Klein in baﬄement.
“We take shifts to rest once a week.” The carriage driver’s tone
turned heavy.
The ticketing oﬃcer beside him added, “We are in charge of plying
the streets from six to eleven in the morning. Following that, we have
lunch and an afternoon break. Near dinnertime, which is six in the
evening, we replace our colleagues… Even if we do not need rest, the
two horses will need it.”
“It wasn’t anything like that in the past. There was an accident that
should not have happened. Due to fatigue, a carriage driver lost
control of his carriage and it toppled. It resulted in us having shifts…
Those bloodsuckers would never become this kind so suddenly
otherwise!” The carriage driver scoﬀed.
Under the illumination of dawn, the carriage drove towards
Zouteland Street and picked up seven to eight passengers on the way.
After Klein was less tense, he did not converse further. He closed his
eyes and recalled the experiences from yesterday, hoping to notice if
he had forgotten anything.
By the time the skies were bright when the sun was fully up, the
carriage ﬁnally arrived at Zouteland Street.
Klein pressed his hat with his left hand and briskly jumped oﬀ the
carriage.
He quickly stepped into 36 Zouteland Street and arrived outside
Blackthorn Security Company after going up the ﬂight of stairs.
The door was still closed and had yet to open.
Klein took out the ring of keys by his waist and found the
corresponding brass key and inserted it into the keyhole and twisted
it.
He pushed forward as the door slowly opened. He saw the black-
haired, green-eyed Leonard Mitchell sniﬃng at a recently popular
cigarette.
“To be honest, I prefer cigars… You seem to be in a rush?” the poet-
like Nighthawk asked in a relaxed and cozy manner.
“Where’s Captain?” Klein asked instead of answering.
Leonard pointed at the partition.
“He’s in the oﬃce. As an advanced Sleepless, he only needs two
hours of sleep in the day. I believe it’s a potion those factory owners
or bankers would like the most.”
Klein nodded and quickly passed through the partition. He saw that
Dunn Smith had opened the door to his oﬃce and he was standing at
its entrance.
“What’s the matter?” Dressed in his black windbreaker, he held a
gold-inlaid cane with a solemn and stern expression.
“The feeling of déjà vu came to me. It should be the notebook. The
Antigonus family’s notebook.” Klein tried hard to make his answer
clear and logical.
“Where was that?” Dunn Smith’s expression did not have any obvious
changes.
However, Klein’s intuition told him that a clear and invisible stir had
happened in him. This was possibly a ﬂash of his spirit or a change in
his emotions.
“It’s at the place Leonard and I saved the hostage yesterday. Opposite
the kidnappers’ room. I didn’t notice it back then until I had a dream
and received a revelation,” Klein did not conceal anything.
“From the looks of it, I missed out on making huge contributions.”
Leonard, who had walked to the partition, chuckled.
Dunn nodded slightly as he instructed with a solemn expression, “Get
Kenley to replace Old Neil’s watch of the armory. Let Old Neil and
Frye come with us.”
Leonard stopped acting frivolous as he immediately informed Kenley
and Frye who were in the Nighthawks’ entertainment room. One of
them was a Sleepless and the other was a Corpse Collector.
Five minutes later, the two-wheeled carriage that came under the
jurisdiction of the Nighthawks began driving down the sparse streets
in the morning.
Leonard wore a feather hat, a shirt and a vest. He stood in as the
carriage driver, lashing out a whip from time to time, sending out a
crisp crack.
Inside the carriage, Klein and Old Neil sat on one side. Facing them
were Dunn Smith and Frye.
The Corpse Collector’s skin was so white it looked like it either had
not been under the sun in a very long while or he had a severe blood
deﬁciency. He looked to be in his thirties with black hair and blue
eyes. He had a high nose bridge and his lips were very thin. He had a
cold and dark demeanor and had a faint smell from often touching
corpses.
“Repeat the situation again in detail.” Dunn adjusted the collar of his
black windbreaker.
Klein stroked the hanging topaz in his sleeve as he began from their
mission commissioning until the dream. By the side, Old Neil
chuckled.
“Your fate seems to be entwined with that Antigonus family’s
notebook. I never expected you to meet it in such a manner.”
That’s right. Isn’t this too much of a coincidence!? Thankfully,
Leonard just mentioned that there was no indication of hidden
factions of mysterious powers at play from the preliminary
investigations of Elliott’s kidnapping. It was solely a crime motivated
by money. Otherwise, I would really suspect if someone had
deliberately arranged for this to happen… Klein found the situation
rather curious.
It was too coincidental!
Dunn did not express his ideas as he was in deep thought. Likewise,
Corpse Collector Frye maintained his silence in his black
windbreaker.
Only when the carriage stopped at the building mentioned by Klein
was the silence broken.
“Let’s go up. Klein, you and Old Neil walk behind. Be careful, very
careful.” Dunn got oﬀ the carriage and pulled out a strange revolver
with a clearly long and thick barrel. He stuﬀed it into his right
pocket.
“Alright.” Klein did not dare take point.
After Leonard found someone to watch the carriage, the ﬁve
Beyonders walked orderly into the building. With very light footsteps,
they arrived at the third ﬂoor.
“Is this the place?” Leonard pointed at the apartment opposite the
kidnappers.
Klein tapped his glabella twice and activated his Spirit Vision.
In this state, his spiritual perception was enhanced again. He found
the door familiar as if he had once entered it before.
“Yes.” He nodded in aﬃrmation.
Old Neil also activated his spiritual perception and after observing
carefully, he said, “There’s no one inside, nor are there any spiritual
glows of magic.”
Corpse Collector Frye added with his hoarse voice, “There aren’t any
evil spirits.”
He could see many spiritual bodies, including evil spirits and restless
wraiths, even without activating his Spirit Vision.
Leonard took a step forward and, like yesterday, punched the door’s
lock.
This time not only did the surrounding wood shatter, even the door
lock ﬂew and fell noisily to the ground.
Klein seemed to feel an invisible seal instantly vanish. Immediately
following that, he caught a whiﬀ of an intense stench.
“Corpse, a rotting corpse,” Frye described coldly.
He did not appear to suﬀer from nausea.
Dunn reached out his black-gloved right hand and pushed open the
door slowly. The ﬁrst thing that they saw was a chimney. For early
July, there was an abnormal heat emanating the room.
In front of the chimney was a rocking chair. Sitting on it was an old
woman dressed in black and white. Her head hung low.
Her body was abnormally large. Her skin was blackish-green and
swollen. It felt like she would explode from a simple prod, spewing a
foul rotting stench from within. As maggots and other parasites
squirmed between her ﬂesh, blood, and rotting juices, or clothes and
wrinkles, they appeared like points of light in Spirit Vision. They
seemed to cling close to an extinguished darkness.
Pa! Pa!
The old woman’s eyeballs dropped to the ﬂoor and rolled a few
times, leaving behind a yellowish-brown streak.
Klein felt disgusted and being unable to tolerate the putrid stench any
longer, he bent over and puked.
Chapter 46: Portrait
Eugh! Eugh!
Klein squatted there, vomiting involuntarily. He was soon done with
his puking since he did not eat breakfast.
At that moment, a tin-colored square ﬂask that looked like a cigarette
box appeared in front of him.
The mouth which had lost its stopper emitted a mixture of smells
akin to tobacco, disinfectant, and mint leaves. It cleared up Klein’s
nose and rejuvenated him.
The pungent smell continued to linger, but Klein no longer felt
nauseous. He soon stopped vomiting.
He traced the tiny ﬂask up and saw a pale hand that did not seem to
belong to a member of the living. He saw the mouth of a black
windbreaker’s sleeve and saw Corpse Collector Frye with his cold and
dark bearing.
“Thank you.” Klein recovered completely and with his hands on his
knees, he stood back up.
Frye nodded without any expression.
“It’ll be ﬁne once you are used to it.”
He put back the ﬂask’s stopper and put it into his pocket and turned
around, walking to the highly decomposed corpse. Without gloves, he
began examining the old woman. As for Dunn Smith and Leonard
Mitchell, they paced slowly around the room, occasionally touching
the table’s surface or newspapers.
Old Neil pinched his nose and stood outside the door, grumbling in a
muﬄed voice, “Seriously gross. I’m going to request for additional
pay this month!”
Dunn turned his head over and touched the wall beside the chimney
with his gloved right hand. While doing so, he asked Klein, “Does this
place look familiar?”
Klein held his breath and constructed the silver pocket watch in his
mind to calm down.
With him already in his Spirit Vision state, he immediately felt
diﬀerent. A scene that came from the deepest recesses of his
memories ﬂashed past his eyes.
Chimney, rocking chair, table, newspapers, the rusty nails on the door, the
tin cans inlaid with silver…
The scenes were dark and dull, like a documentary from Earth.
However, it was even more blurry and illusory.
The scene quickly stacked against what Klein was seeing. The feelings
of déjà vu and having been here before presented themselves clearly.
An illusory and ethereal scream seemed to pass through invisible
walls:
“Hornacis… Flegrea… Hornacis… Flegrea… Hornacis… Flegrea…”
“It feels a little familiar.” Klein answered honestly while his brain felt
a stabbing pain. Thankfully, he quickly tapped his glabella twice.
Hornacis… The Hornacis mountain range that appeared in original
Klein’s diary?
That is content that was deciphered from the Antigonus family’s
notebook…
The murmurs were very similar to one of the previous ones. It involved the
word ‘Hornacis’ Is this a form of enticement?
Klein was gripped by shock as he did not dare think deeper, afraid
that he would place himself on the trajectory of losing control.
Dunn nodded slightly and walked to a cupboard. He suddenly
reached out his hand and pulled open its wooden door.
The bread inside was moldy and there were about seven gray, stiﬀ
dead rats.
“Leonard, go downstairs to get patrolling cops and explain the
situation here,” instructed Dunn.
“Alright.” Leonard turned and left the apartment.
Following that, Dunn opened the door to two other bedrooms and did
a careful search.
After being certain that there were no clues as well as any sign of the
Antigonus family’s notebook, Frye also stood up. He wiped his hands
with a white handkerchief he brought along with him and said, “The
time of death was more than ﬁve days ago. There are no external
injuries nor are there any clear signs that it was a result of Beyonder
powers. The exact cause of death will require a postmortem.”
“Did you discover anything?” Dunn turned to look at Old Neil and
Klein.
The two who were no longer in Spirit Vision state shook their heads
in unison.
“Apart from the corpse, everything else is normal. Actually, no, there
was an invisible energy sealing the apartment in the beginning. As
you know, there will usually be similar processes when we use
ritualistic magic,” Old Neil thought for a few seconds before adding.
Dunn was just about to say something when he looked outside the
door. A few seconds later, Klein and Old Neil sensed something and
turned to look at the stairwell.
A few seconds later, faint footsteps grew louder as Leonard walked up
with a policeman.
The policeman’s expression changed once he caught the noxious
smell. He immediately cooperated with his “colleague” from the
Special Operations Department and began knocking on the doors of
the residents on the second ﬂoor to gain an understanding of the
situation on the third ﬂoor.
Moments later, the corporal with his two silver chevrons looked at
the corpse on the rocking chair.
“Katy Stefania Bieber. Between 55 and 60 years old. Widow. Has
rented this apartment with her son, Ray Bieber for more than ten
years.”
“Her husband was formerly a gem artisan. Her son is about thirty
years old and is single. He inherited his father’s trade and earns about
one pound and ﬁfteen soli a week. According to their neighbors, they
have not seen them in more than a week.”
Before the policeman continued, Klein already knew the critical point
that followed.
Missing. To be more precise, it was unknown where Ray Bieber had gone
to!
The ancient notebook could very well be on him!
“Do you have a picture of Ray Bieber?” Dunn looked at the police
oﬃcer. He was acting as the role of a high-ranking inspector.
However, it was not really acting since he was indeed a high-ranking
inspector on the police department’s roster. His salary and various
allowances were also paid according to his rank. Of course, it did not
include his salary from the Church.
The police oﬃcer shook his head nervously and said, “I’m not sure…
I’ll have to return to the station to search for it. It’s not typical for us
to have pictures of every single person.”
“Got it. Continue questioning the residents on the ﬁrst ﬂoor. Ask
them in detail.” Dunn gave the order.
As he watched the police oﬃcer leave, he closed the door and turned
to Old Neil.
“I’ll leave the rest to you. If not, we will have to make all the
residents sleep and obtain Ray Bieber’s looks. Yea, I don’t really trust
sketches based on verbal descriptions.”
Old Neil nodded. He took out a few thumb-sized bottles from a
pocket in his black classic robe and scattered the liquids in a
particular order.
Immediately following that, he pulled out a clump of powder and
scattered it in a circle around him.
Strangely, a biting smell spread and was not inﬂuenced by the
nauseating smells in the room. Klein also suddenly noticed that there
was an invisible forceﬁeld around him. It separated him from the
environment and everyone else. It was like the room in its previous
state.
Old Neil half-closed his eyes as his lips mumbled a soft and
indiscernible incantation. Without being prepared, Klein vaguely
heard the words, “Goddess, give me strength,” “We look forward to
the protection of the Night…”
Hum! A sudden wind tore through the windows and blew up the
powder.
Klein’s heart quaked suddenly as he felt goosebumps all over him. He
found it diﬃcult to describe. A terrifying “smell” that made him
afraid of looking directly spread rapidly.
He was confused as he tensed up, unable to relax. It felt as though he
had plunged into a state similar to what one would have after
working on a highly advanced mathematical problem.
Suddenly, Old Neil’s eyes opened, his eyes pitch-black.
He took out a fountain pen from his pocket and began drawing on a
piece of scrap paper on the table. He was so fast that his entire body
was trembling.
Klein focused his gaze and saw a face with recessed eyes and a tall
nose bridge rapidly appear.
When the natural curly short hair was done, Old Neil wrote a single
line beneath the portrait.
“Black hair, deep blue eyes. Left of his mouth is a fully ceramic tooth
implant.”
Pada! The fountain pen in Old Neil’s hand fell onto the paper as his
body convulsed a few times.
“This is the image of Ray Bieber according to what’s left in the
room.” Old Neil whispered as the color of his eyes restored rapidly.
Then, he turned back to his original spot and slowly circled it. The
invisible forceﬁeld that isolated things immediately dissipated in the
form of a breeze.
“Praise the Lady.” Old Neil tapped his chest in four spots, forming the
shape of the crimson moon.
Klein’s taut nerves relaxed as he made more acute observations. He
discovered that there was nothing special about Ray Bieber’s facial
features. He had a relatively mild bearing. The only thing was that
his philtrum sagged clearly.
“I’ll try using Dowsing Rod Seeking.” He picked up the portrait and
found male clothes in the bedroom and spread them onto the ground.
Dunn, Leonard, and Old Neil did not stop him as they watched him
place the black cane above the clothes and portrait. Frye was as silent
as always.
Klein’s eyes turned from brown to black as he ﬁnished his recitation,
only to release his grip.
The black cane stood silently like it was embedded in the ground.
“Ray Bieber’s location.” Klein silently repeated to himself again.
With the sound of humming wind, the cane fell down but kept
changing directions while falling. Finally, it began spinning in slight
circles.
Without any external help, the black cane stood stably again.
Klein repeated a few times with the same outcome. All he could do
was shake his head at Dunn and Old Neil.
A strange power was interfering with his “divination…”
Dunn took oﬀ his black glove and said to Leonard and Klein, “Take
Ray Bieber’s portrait and inquire the residents for a ﬁnal
conﬁrmation. Following that, we will issue a warrant of arrest against
him for the murder of his mother.”
“Alright.” Klein held his cane and bent down to pick the portrait.
After the neighbors conﬁrmed that the portrait was indeed Ray
Bieber, Dunn instructed Leonard and the police oﬃcer to ﬁnish the
procedures at the station. He and Frye headed to a few bars in Tingen
City to seek help via other means.
Klein and Old Neil returned to Blackthorn Security Company on a
public carriage. It was not even eight by the time they arrived;
Rozanne had not even clocked in.
After closing the door, Klein cocked his head at Old Neil and, hoping
to learn and answer his questions, asked him, “Why would I send the
Antigonus family’s notebook to Ray Bieber’s home?”
This was completely in a diﬀerent direction from Iron Cross Street
where Welch stayed.
Old Neil walked to the sofa and chuckled.
“Isn’t that obvious? Who knows what powers inside the notebook you
invoked; maybe you did some described ritual out of curiosity and
ended up provoking a strange existence that you should not have.
The motive of this existence was to have the notebook sent to Ray
Bieber and sever all clues, to prevent anyone from discovering it.”
“Therefore, apart from you who were selected, Welch and Naya
committed suicide; regarding you… To be frank, I still have no idea
how you survived.”
“I would like to know too…” Klein sat down as well as he
deliberately replied with a wry smile. “I’ve also thought of the
guesses you have of the proceedings. However, there’s one thing I
don’t understand. Why did I have to hand the notebook to Ray
Bieber?”
Old Neil shrugged and said, “Perhaps his Life Path Number 1 matches
the requirements, or maybe he’s one of the last remaining
descendants of the Antigonus family. In short, there are too many
possibilities… And why the notebook was sold to Tingen City would
have similar reasons.”
“I do not think it’s because he’s a descendant.” Klein suddenly felt
enlightened before he sighed. “Unfortunately, I did not discover
immediately that Ray Bieber and that notebook have vanished.”
Old Neil laughed.
“This is something that Dunn has to worry about. As for you, it’s
something good.”
“Why do you say so?” Klein frowned in puzzlement.
Chapter 47: Old Neil's Lack of
Money
Old Neil rubbed his temples and said, “I believe we have a general
idea of why the three of you engaged in a mass suicide. That
notebook is also now purportedly in Ray Bieber’s hands.
Furthermore, the matter has already been exposed. Regardless of
whether you are alive or dead, it will hardly inﬂuence any
subsequent developments. I think—I believe that the surreptitious
existence or mysterious power that caused all of this will not pay you
any special attention. It’s just like how you would not pay attention
to the ants on the ground. Heh heh, as long as you do not try to make
Him recall you.
“And our arrest warrant for Ray Bieber will quickly reach the Secret
Order. They will also be able to guess that it is related to the
Antigonus family’s notebook. Believe me, for a secret organization
that has been in existence for more than a thousand years, it has
many channels of information. Therefore, their focus will be diverted
to Ray Bieber’s whereabouts, in a bid to ﬁnd the notebook before us.
They will not, nor is it possible for them to harass, stalk, or deal with
you.
“Lad, congratulations on stepping out from the shadows of the past.
What follows will be a brand-new journey ﬁlled with sunlight.”
Klein nodded when he heard that as he said in a happy and relieved
manner, “I hope so.”
Having transmigrated here, he had been enveloped in uncertainty.
Now, it felt like it had ﬁnally dissipated…
However, Klein was still feeling uncertain because the notebook
seemed to be tied to him in a certain manner. It went to the point of
him bumping into remnant clues coincidentally from a normal
mission of rescuing a hostage.
He was afraid that there would come a day when a delivery man
would send him a parcel, only to realize that it was that Antigonus
family notebook after opening it up!
Let’s hope everything will go as Old Neil described… He silently
prayed.
When Old Neil heard his reply, he immediately scoﬀed.
“You don’t seem to be a devout believer of the Goddess. At this
moment, shouldn’t you be drawing the sign of the crimson moon at
your chest and say—may Goddess bless us?”
“Mr. Neil, you don’t seem like one either. A real devotee would not
say ‘what follows will be a brand-new journey ﬁlled with sunlight.'”
Having been studying mysticism under Old Neil, Klein had
established a decent friendship with him, so he did not stand on
ceremony to return a sarcastic remark.
Both of them locked eyes and chuckled with great rapport. At the
same time, they tapped their chests four times.
“Praise the Lady!”
At that moment, they heard the grinding sounds of machinery as the
main door to Blackthorn Security Company opened.
The elegant Mrs. Orianna with her fashionably coiled hair stepped
into the reception hall with a light-green dress.
“Good morning, Mr. Neil. Good morning, Klein.” She held a small
leather handbag as she greeted with a smile. “It’s another fabulous
day today. A pretty good day.”
“Good morning, Orianna. You are still as beautiful as ten years ago,”
replied Old Neil with a chuckle.
Orianna’s eyes turned to slits as she upturned her face.
“Mr. Neil, the way you praise is still as infuriating as ten years ago.”
She enunciated the words ‘ten years.’
“Is that so?” Old Neil looked at Klein, confused. He wore a perplexed
look.
Never mention anything that will remind the ladies of their age… As
a keyboard warrior that knew a little of everything, Klein instantly
understood what had peeved Mrs. Orianna. He smiled lightly and
said,
“Good morning, Mrs. Orianna. You are as beautiful as always.”
“Thank you, our outstanding Khoy University graduate.” Orianna
smiled with a nod before saying, “That old butler has already paid
the mission’s commission. According to Captain’s rules, half of it will
be used as additional funds, while the other half will be split between
you and Leonard. But since you aren’t a formal member, you can only
take ten percent of the half. Come over later to sign for it.”
“How much did he pay?” Klein asked happily while also feeling the
pinch.
“200 pounds. This was what he said back then—’Lord, the esteemed
Storm! I never imagined or believed that this was resolved just like
that! This is even harder than us having a dream! Why is your
security company so unknown? It’s an insult to the entire industry!'”
Mrs. Orianna mimicked the old butler’s southern accent.
Klein thought seriously for a few seconds before saying humorously,
“This is just too unfair for those kidnappers.”
Two Beyonders had resolved the problem quickly using methods that
could be described as easy and pleasant… This is like an adult
bullying a few kids while in full combat attire…
“They were just too unlucky. They must have lost the protection of
the divine,” said Orianna with a soft laugh. “I told the butler that we
were only lucky. One of our informants happened to see the
kidnappers bring the child into the hideout. Therefore, do not have
too much hopes for us. We really are just a very ordinary security
company.”
Typically speaking, the more you emphasize something is ordinary,
the more extraordinary it is… Klein lampooned with a smile. He
watched Mrs. Orianna walk through the partition and enter the
accounting room.
Old Neil puckered his lips by the side and said enviously, “You really
are a lucky lad. You haven’t joined us for long and you’ve
encountered a job worth 200 pounds.”
“Is that very rare?” Klein asked in puzzlement.
Prior to this, he was either studying history or mysticism, or
wandering aimlessly outside, hoping to ﬁnd clues with his spiritual
perception.
“According to Orianna’s accounts, we might not encounter a single
job an entire week. And most jobs are worth less than twenty
pounds.” Old Neil rubbed the moonstone by his wrist and sighed.
Following that, he looked at Klein with anticipation.
“If you encounter any similar jobs in the future, remember to inform
me.”
Upon hearing Old Neil’s words, Klein suddenly felt a strange feeling
arise in him. Therefore, he asked directly, “Mr. Neil, you seem to be
lacking in money. How much do you get paid a week? If you aren’t
comfortable telling me, just ignore my question.”
Old Neil leaned back into the sofa and chuckled.
“This isn’t something that needs hiding. I’ve been here for so many
years. At present, I will obtain salaries from both the Church and the
police department every week; a total of twelve pounds.”
“A weekly salary of twelve pounds?” Klein blurted out in surprise.
A weekly salary of twelve pounds with ﬁfty-two weeks a year, that
meant more than 600 pounds a year!
Back when he read the Tingen Morning Post and Honest Paper, they
had mentioned that high-proﬁle lawyers only earned 800 to 1000
pounds a year. And those were the best lawyers!
As for the managers of Benson’s trading company, they only earned
six pounds a week. That was already quite a decent job.
“Yes, such a salary is actually quite generous, and we do not need to
pay any taxes,” added Old Neil with a smile.
Klein had heard from Benson that one had to pay E-type taxes when
their weekly salaries exceeded one pound. In other words, the
government and corporate employees had to pay 3% of taxes if they
earned one to two pounds, 5% for two to ﬁve pounds, 10% for ﬁve to
ten pounds, and 15% for ten to twenty pounds, capping at 20% for
those above twenty pounds.
Other than that, he also read of four other kinds of taxes on the
newspapers. A-type was related to land, housing, and other earnings
from material items. It included property and rent. B-type was a tax
paid by farmers. C-type was a tax on proﬁts from bonds, funds, and
equities. D-type was commercial, ﬁnance, or professional income.
“It’s something admirable.” Klein echoed Old Neil.
“However—” Old Neil shook his head. “Such a salary is insuﬃcient
for Beyonders like us who have to frequently study the hidden
mysteries, practice and attempt rituals.”
“Aren’t materials obtainable via application?” asked Klein in
puzzlement.
Old Neil scoﬀed.
“There’s a limitation to it. At times, we have to give a suﬃcient
legitimate reason. If you want to learn more and experiment in the
ﬁeld of mysticism, you can only spend your own dime to buy
materials. It can be bought internally or at underground markets.”
Klein jolted in surprise as he immediately asked, “There are Beyonder
materials that are sold in underground markets? I thought the
Churches would not permit their existence?”
He was lacking in means to obtain materials!
With him having a mysterious organization in its nascent stages, he
could not always have them settled via the Nighthawks, right?
“There’s no way to control such matters. Yeah, from the viewpoint of
mysticism, all beings are sentient with their spirits and they stem
from the same source. The materials we use are not limited to those
extraordinary creatures. It also comes from ordinary animals, plants,
and minerals. For example, the poison hemlock, gold mint leaves,
and night vanilla in the bottle of Seer potion; they are items we can
encounter frequently in our daily lives. They might not have any
extraordinary characteristics, but they have special characteristics.
Through concoction and blending, they will derive certain eﬀects.
Therefore, this is not a trade that the Church can ban,” explained Old
Neil in detail.
Without waiting for Klein to say a word, he continued, “Besides, it’s
not only the core of extraordinary beings that are of use. For
example, the Lavos Squid. Apart from its blood, its eyeballs, skin, and
tentacles are pretty good materials. Unless the Church captures it
entirely with its own manpower, to completely corner and control
any outﬂows would be a tremendous ﬁnancial burden. The lower the
grade of the extraordinary material, the more it is so. They can only
do their best to prevent the more special materials from ﬂowing out.”
Old Neil suddenly laughed. “There’s another important reason. It’s
better to know of an underground market than not knowing of it.
Under the premise that secret organizations have not been fully
eliminated, this is a pretty good strategy. Besides, it can help us
obtain materials we are lacking. Of course, with the existence of such
markets, contraband items will appear. As long as it’s not something
ridiculous or overly dangerous, we will turn a blind eye to it. At
most, we would use them to enrich our vaults.”
“Is it because the few large Churches put each other in place, so no
one can take excessive action?” Klein guessed.
Old Neil acknowledged tersely but did not elaborate.
“I’m a Seer. In the future, I’ll deﬁnitely need to practice and will need
more materials. Mr. Neil, can you take me to the underground market
to have a look?” Klein requested with a valid reason.
Old Neil appeared to be placed in a diﬃcult position.
“In fact, those guys who are active in those places are mostly not
Beyonders. Some of them might be aristocrats that like mystery or
rich people who have inclinations towards mysticism… Uh, alright. I
have a thirty pound bill that needs paying soon. It wouldn’t be
convenient for me to head over there for the time being.”
“Alright…” Klein never expected the reason to be Old Neil’s owing of
money.
Moments later, he said with deliberation, “Mr. Neil, do you need me
to lend you money? I just earned a commission of ten pounds.”
“Haha, there’s no need. I’ll be able to settle it.” Old Neil patted the
sofa and slowly stood up. “Sigh, age is truly an enemy that biological
creatures can’t ﬁght. I’m exhausted from last night’s watch. Yeah,
revise what I’ve taught you later this morning. Read more documents.
Tomorrow, I’ll teach you the foundations of ritualistic magic.”
“Alright.” Klein got up and bade him farewell by taking oﬀ his hat.
When Captain Dunn did not return at noon, Klein pretended that he
was still searching for the notebook as he roamed the streets again.
Having earned ten pounds, he no longer needed to wait for the next
disbursement of the funds. He could head directly to the Divination
Club!
Cogitation and Spirit Vision have been occasionally producing
murmurings and illusions. It made him eager to begin ‘acting.’
Chapter 48: Hanass Vincent
In the Divination Club situated at the second ﬂoor of 13 Howes
Street, North Borough of Tingen City.
Klein saw the beautiful lady that attended to visitors once again.
She was still having her brownish-yellow long hair coiled, making
her look mature and elegant. It was hard to tell her age.
“Hello, Mr. Glacis isn’t here today. Would you like to change fortune-
tellers today?” said the beautiful lady with a smile.
Upon hearing that, Klein, who had just taken oﬀ his silk hat and put
it back on, was immediately surprised.
“You still remember me?”
That was already ﬁve days ago!
The woman puckered her lips into a smile.
“You are the ﬁrst customer that sought Mr. Glacis’s services. You are
also the only one to this very day. It’s hard for me not to have a deep
impression of you.”
Was this the image of him being penny-wise, pound-foolish? Klein
lampooned himself as he deliberated a question.
“When was the last time Mr. Glacis came to the club?”
The lady shot a glance at him and answered seemingly in
recollection, “To be honest, we are unable to grasp when our
members will come and go. They have their free will and personal
matters to tend to. Well, I do believe that Mr. Glacis hasn’t come to
the club since he told your fortune that day.”
I wish him the best of luck. May the Goddess bless him… Klein
prayed and did not ask further. Instead, he asked with a smile, “I’m
not here for divination services this time. I plan to join the club.”
“Really? That’s our pleasure.” The lady expressed a timely look of
surprise delight. “For the ﬁrst year as a member, the membership fee
is ﬁve pounds. It will be one pound a year thereafter. I believe there’s
no need for me to describe in the details again?”
Klein took out a ﬁve-pound note he recently received as he watched
Henry Augustus I’s portrait depart him.
After seriously checking the anti-counterfeit watermark, the woman
stored away the note seriously and handed a form to Klein.
“Please feel in your detailed information. Let me prepare the receipt
for you.”
There’s a receipt? You should bill it to Blackthorn Security
Company… Klein was amused by his own thoughts as he picked up a
fountain pen on the desk. With the blackish-blue ink, he ﬁlled in his
name, age, address, and company information.
However, he had deliberately left his date-of-birth empty. To a Seer,
that provided profound mysteries about his body through his Life
Path Number.
After receiving the receipt and ﬁnishing his registration as a member,
the lady extended her right hand.
“Congratulations on joining Tingen City’s Divination Club. I’m
Angelica Barrehart, your hardworking server. This is your member
cuﬄinks. There are special inscriptions on them which will identify
you as a member.”
“Hello, Madam Angelica.” Klein shook her hand and took the dark
gold cuﬄinks.
He realized that the special inscription was written with the root
word for ‘fortune-teller’ in Hermes.
Angelica retracted her left hand and thought for a few seconds.
“Might I ask what divination arts you are most familiar with? Or
would you prefer to learn some divination methods from the club?
We will consider inviting famous fortune-tellers of the corresponding
domain to give classes. We will also introduce you members with
similar expertise so that you can have a good time interacting with
them.”
“I know a bit of every divination art. There’s no need to give me any
special considerations.” Klein replied with some embellishments. In
addition, he inquired, “Can I begin telling the fortunes of others? I’m
not a total rookie.”
He was here to act as a Seer and not learn the divination methods
ordinary people could learn.
Angelica maintained a polite smile as she said, “You can tell the
fortunes of people anytime in the club. However, before we conﬁrm
your skills, we will not promote you when our customers ask. How
much do you plan on charging for your fortune-telling?”
“Two pence.” Klein decided to gain at advantage with price while he
was still unknown.
“We will go by the standard of taking an eighth, so we will be taking
a quarterpence for fees…” Angelica repeated the various rules ﬁrst
before writing Klein’s information into the fortune-teller album which
customers could choose from.
After all of this was done, she pointed at the meeting room at the far
end of the corridor with a smile.
“Mr. Hanass Vincent is currently explaining astrolabe divination. You
can ﬁnd a quiet spot to listen in. You can also raise your questions if
there are any queries.”
“Alright.” Klein walked toward the meeting room with his interest
piqued. He wanted to know the diﬀerences between what Hanass
Vincent and Old Neil said.
At that moment, Angelica chased up and whispered, “Mr. Moretti,
would you want coﬀee or tea? We provide Sibe black tea, Southville
coﬀee, and Desi coﬀee.”
Klein, who had been reading the papers regularly, knew that these
coﬀees and black tea were considered as one of the inferior varieties,
but he also knew that they were deﬁnitely of better quality than the
ones he had at home. After some thought, he said, “A cup of
Southville coﬀee. Three teaspoons of sugar without milk please.”
Loen Kingdom’s Southville was famous for its beer and red wine;
many important ﬁgures were fond of them. However, their coﬀee was
relatively unknown.
“Alright, I’ll send it to you in a bit.” Angelica pointed towards the
meeting room.
Klein slowly walked to the half-closed door and heard a voice in a
thick Awwa accent explaining, “Astrolabe divination is a relatively
more complex one among the divination arts…”
But that’s only for ordinary people… Klein silently tagged on a
sentence for the speaker. He saw about ﬁve tables placed in a circle
inside the meeting room. It surrounded a middle-aged man in a black
classic robe, Hanass Vincent.
The gentleman had obvious dark circles. His brown hair was thick
and hard. Each strand stood ﬁrmly like a porcupine’s spikes.
Apart from that, there was nothing unique about him.
Upon seeing Klein enter, Hanass Vincent nodded gently without
stopping his class. He only slowed down his speech.
Klein had one hand in his pocket while the other held his cane. He
found a seat to the sides and sat down, leaning back comfortably in
the process. He scanned the circle of six members. There were four
men and two women.
Some of them were attentively taking notes, whispering, or returning
Klein a rueful smile.
After placing his cane down, Klein adjusted his halved top hat and
tapped his glabella twice in the process.
He cast his gaze at Hanass and saw the diﬀerent colors, brightness,
and thickness of his aura.
“Dark red. He’s a little worried… Actually, every other part of his
body is healthy except that part. I wonder what’s wrong…” Klein
listened to the class while muttering to himself.
At that moment, he clasped his right hand and covered his mouth to
prevent his laughter from sounding. He suddenly felt like he was a
quack.
He was rather pleased with his Spirit Vision ability. Although he
could only make a general judgment and not the details, it was
enough to gain him many useful information.
After surveying his surroundings, he tapped his glabella twice again
as though he was pondering over what Hanass had just said.
Astrolabe divination was one of the astromancy divination methods.
However, ordinary people could also attempt to interpret things. For
instance, the most basic birth horoscope was to determine the
inquirer’s fate by determining the positions of the sun, moon, blue
and red stars at their birth, the corresponding spots in the sky,
matching the representative symbols to the astrolabe, and the
corresponding situations of the diﬀerent constellations.
This required the fortune-teller to be able to calculate the states of
the planets and constellations which was rather complicated. Of
course, there were publications that aided people to look up the
values. Some even simpliﬁed it by making a vague read with just the
constellations.
Klein listened silently without interjecting or asking any questions.
From time to time, he would caress the hanging topaz at his sleeve or
take a sip of the Southville coﬀee which Angelica had brought in.
After some time, Hanass rubbed his glabella and said, “Perhaps you
will need to attempt at creating your own astrolabe. Ask me if you
have any questions. I will be in Moonstone.”
After he left, a young man in a white shirt and black vest got up with
a smile and walked to Klein’s side.
“Nice to meet you. I’m Edward Steve.”
“My pleasure. I’m Klein Moretti.” Klein stood up and returned the
bow.
“Astrolabes are too complicated. Every time I hear about it, I can’t
help but doze oﬀ,” said Edward self-deprecatingly.
Klein grinned and said, “That’s because Mr. Vincent can’t help but
pass the knowledge he grasps to us. It’s like giving us an Intis feast.
It’s just indigestible.”
“I’d be able to ﬁnish the Intis feast. They usually use a huge plate to
serve tiny bits of food.” Edward chuckled and sat up. He asked out of
curiosity, “Are you new? I’ve not seen you in the two years I was
here.”
“I just joined the club today,” answered Klein frankly.
“What are you good at? I’m best at tarot and poker divination,”
Edward casually asked.
“I know a little of everything, but just a little.” Klein gave a
description he used to give himself.
He was not being modest since there was just too much mysterious
knowledge he had not grasped in the domain of divination.
Just as the other members were thinking of talking about horoscope
divination, Angelica walked into the meeting room.
“Mr. Steve, someone wants you to tell their fortunes.”
“Alright.” Edward stood up with a smile.
“I can tell you are an excellent fortune-teller,” said Klein as he looked
at him.
“No, it’s because my price is most suitable,” said Edward with a soft
chortle. “When ordinary people come to have their fortunes told,
they will absolutely not choose the most expensive ones. And unless
they had their heads kicked by asses, they would deﬁnitely not be
choosing the cheapest few. It’s easiest to gain opportunities if you are
in the middle.”
I’m one of those that had their heads kicked by asses… When he saw
Edward leave, Klein suddenly shook his head with a wry smile.
It seems the price I set is problematic…
He stood up, picked up his cane, and left the meeting room. He found
Angelica again.
“I wish to change the prices of my divination. Uh, set it to eight
pence.”
Angelica took a deep look at him and said, “We will satisfy your
request, but we will also tell customers that you only recently joined
the club.”
“No problem.” Klein did not mind as he nodded.
At times, mystery was also an important element for a Seer to attract
customers.
After changing his details, Klein returned to the meeting room.
At that moment, he saw Hanass Vincent walk out of Moonstone. He
held a silver-coated mirror.
This well-known fortune-teller said to the ﬁve members in the
meeting room, “I recently learned a new divination art. Magic mirror
divination. Does anyone want to learn?”
Magic mirror divination? That’s not safe… Klein paused outside the
meeting room and frowned.
Chapter 49: Divination Art
As a Seer who had just stepped through the gates of mysticism, Klein
did not dare to claim he knew much. However, he was certain he
knew more than ordinary people. He was aware that the various
kinds of divination arts could be split into three categories based on
particular standards.
And that standard was based on the source of the revelation!
The ﬁrst category of divination included tarot, poker, pendulums,
dowsing canes, and dreams. By using the inquirer’s own spirituality
and its communication with the spirit world to gain a revelation, it
could be interpreted for an answer. However, spirit pendulums and
dowsing canes had very high requirements of one’s spirituality, Spirit
Body, and Astral Projection. Non-Beyonders were unable to obtain
precise or clear revelations. Card divination provided ﬁxed
symbolism, presenting even an average person’s faint revelation.
Dreams were somewhere in between the other forms.
The second category included Spirit Numerology and astromancy, as
well as their derived forms. The fortune-teller used either the
personal details of the inquirer, or changes in nature before using
calculations, inference, and interpretation to answer their questions.
With this method, the initiative did not lie in the inquirer, but the
fortune-teller.
The third category used an external third party, separate from the
inquirer and the fortune-teller. The Ouija boards that Klein was
familiar with from his previous life belonged in this category. They
used rituals to ask for a direct answer from the unknown or the
supernatural. Even though there was a high chance that an average
person would not succeed, there were cases where they managed to
communicate with malicious spirits or entities that drove them to
insanity. These methods of divination usually led to tragedies.
The magic mirror divination that Hanass Vincent mentioned
belonged to the third category. In mysticism, mirrors were connected
to the unknown and mystery, like they were the doors of the spiritual
word. Thus, Klein stopped outside the meeting room, intending to
learn how the famous fortune-teller would explain the divination.
Klein wanted to ascertain if he needed to inform the captain or not,
raiding him at night.
Of course, there was a safe way to do the magic mirror divination;
one could ask for answers from the seven orthodox divinities. Even if
it was very diﬃcult for an ordinary person to receive any real
revelations, they would not be in any danger or suﬀer any after
eﬀects.
The magic mirror divinations that were strictly controlled by the
Nighthawks and Mandated Punishers were those that asked evil gods
or mysterious existences for help. Furthermore, the fortune-teller
couldn’t randomly fabricate things. Some phrases or qualities had the
potential to invite the attention of unknown entities.
In the world where the powers of the Beyonders exist, such
divinations would often lead to tragedy. Klein even suspected that the
original Klein, Welch, and Naya had committed such a forbidden
divination by following the instructions of the Antigonus family’s
diary.
At that moment, Hanass also explained the principle behind magic
mirror divination and described the actual process.
“First, you choose a suitable time and date according to the divinity
you believe in. You can decide this using the Astromancy Manual. For
example, we all know that Sundays symbolize the Evernight Goddess,
for Sunday is the embodiment of rest. 2 to 3 in the early morning, 9
to 10 in the morning, 4 to 5 in the evening, and 11 to midnight are
all related to the moon; thus, they are controlled by the Evernight
Goddess. Thus, fortune-tellers that pray to the Evernight Goddess can
use magic mirror divination during these times on a Sunday.”
Quite a good foundation… Klein nodded slightly while using the half-
closed door to the meeting room to conceal himself.
It had to be said that with the seven major churches keeping each
other in check, some mysticism knowledge had indeed leaked. For
example, many of the meanings behind the symbolism could be
found in the Astromancy Manual. However, without the potions or
Beyonder powers, ordinary people were unable to obtain the desired
eﬀects.
“Second, we must scrutinize the mirror carefully. It must be a mirror
coated with silver. You place the mirror at the position representing
the moon…” Hanass demonstrated with the prop in his hand.
No, what he needs now is spirit dowsing. First, choose a position and
recite the phrase, ‘This place is suitable for magic mirror divination’
seven times in your head, then see which direction the pendulum
turns. Clockwise for true, counter-clockwise for false… Of course, if
you are asking for answers from a malicious supernatural entity, the
position would not matter. Rather, it would depend on whether the
entity is interested in answering your questions… Klein silently
corrected him.
At this point, he felt like a teacher listening in on a lesson…
Hanass Vincent could not hear Klein’s mental musings as he
described the preparations in detail in a normal tone.
When the members ﬁnished taking notes, he continued explaining,
“After showering, conﬁrm that you have drawn all your curtains and
locked your doors. After that, light up a candle and place it in front
of the mirror before sincerely praying to the divinity you believe in.
Try to keep your questions simple as there’s no need for fanciful
embellishment… After praying seven times, pick up your mirror and
gently toss it on the ground. Make sure to be gentle… Remember the
way it shatters as that is a revelation from the gods… I will tell you
the main symbolisms in a second.”
Phew, this is orthodox magic mirror divination. Klein heaved a sigh
of relief as he walked into the meeting room and sat back down in his
previous seat. He ﬁnished the rest of his Southville coﬀee in one gulp.
So-called “orthodox” divination meant that it was possible to obtain
revelations, but it was impossible to truly interpret it.
And for Beyonders who reached this step, they could look straight
into the mirror to obtain clear information if they received a
response!
As there were many potential symbolisms after the shattering, Hanass
taught for a long while. He was not done even when Edward Steve
returned to the room after ﬁnishing his fortune-telling.
Klein did not ask what Edward did for his fortune-telling or what
method did he use since it was an unspoken rule among fortune-
tellers. While acting as a Seer, he naturally had to abide by it strictly
unless the other party mentioned it.
“I discovered that many a time, our interpretation is too vague, as
though it’s meeting diﬀerent requests, allowing diﬀerent people to
ﬁnd a description of themselves from the interpretation.” Edward
drank a mouthful of Sibe black tea and said with a soft sigh. “For
example, those that encounter adversities and calamities will
eventually see the light of hope. Heh heh, but no one knows when
the light of hope will come. For example, a journey might not be very
smooth-sailing, but you will deﬁnitely arrive alive. Hehe, the dead
will not retort me.”
As he did not listen from the beginning, he ignored Hanass’s magic
mirror divination class.
“Survival bias,” added Klein with a smile.
Survival bias generally meant that a lot of statistics would only
include those who were alive and lucky. The data would ignore the
dead; therefore, the results would be clearly biased.
“Right. Emperor Roselle was really a philosopher,” marveled Edward.
… Speechless, Klein raised his empty cup and pretended to take a sip.
The members were fully immersed in the study of horoscopes and
magic mirror divination the entire afternoon. Occasionally, they
would also discuss with Klein and Edward.
And when that happened, Klein would try his best to meet his duty as
an informal member of the Nighthawks. He would try hard to steer
the topic away from anything related to Beyonders or dangerous
ideas.
However, he failed at the thing he wanted to do the most. A few
inquirers came, but none of them picked him to do their fortune-
telling.
Perhaps I have to be more proactive in entertaining them. Should I
use a few phrases like ‘you are plagued with bad luck,’ ‘you have
been unlucky recently,’ or ‘nothing you do will happen smoothly?’
No, that’s nothing like a Seer… With this in mind, Klein could not
help but shake his head in self-deprecation.
He picked up his cane, stood up, and left after bidding everyone
farewell.
At half past ﬁve, Edward Steve put on his coat and was prepared to
walk out the Divination Club when he suddenly saw a familiar ﬁgure.
“Good afternoon, Glacis. Long time no see,” he greeted with a smile.
He saw his friend with similar interests as him wear his usual format
suit with a black bow tie. In front of his chest hung a monocle.
Immediately following that, he noticed that his friend did not look
well. Even his soft blond hair looked dry.
“Good afternoon, Edward… Cough.” Glacis with his hat in hand
suddenly used his ﬁst to cover his mouth as he coughed a few times.
Edward asked out of concern, “You seem to be ill?”
“A very serious illness. It even turned into pneumonia. If it wasn’t for
my wife who met an impressive apothecary and gave me a magical
medicine, you would have probably had to visit me at the cemetery.”
Glacis’s tone was ﬁlled with a lingering fear and joy.
“Lord, I can’t believe it. You were so healthy previously. Look at you,
you look so frail now! I remember when I did divination on you,
there were no signs that indicated that you would get a serious
illness.” Edward waved his cane and said with an astonished sigh.
“My own divination had the same result as yours. Perhaps we are not
qualiﬁed fortune-tellers. Besides…” Glacis suddenly recalled the
happenings on Monday as his expression turned abnormally serious.
At that moment, the beautiful lady, Angelica, came over and bowed
with a pleasant smile.
After exchanging greetings, she ﬁrst showed concern for Glacis’s
health and provided some suggestions. Then, she mentioned in
passing, “Mr. Glacis, Mr. Moretti, who requested your divination
services previously, has joined our club as well.”
“The one who got me to tell his fortune?” Glacis’s eyes lit up
immediately. “Lord, where is he?”
“He just left.” Angelica and Edward were unable to comprehend
Glacis’s abnormal reaction.
Glacis took two steps in agitation and said, “The next time he comes,
please ask him when he will come if I’m not around!”
“Glacis, what happened? Did that Mr. Klein Moretti do something to
you?” asked Edward in puzzlement.
Glacis raised his arm and stared straight into Edward’s and Angelica’s
probing gazes. He said in excitement, “He’s a very, very, very
magical…”
He lowered his arm and said after using “very” thrice, “Doctor!”
Chapter 50: Old Neil's Method of
Repayment
Half past seven in the evening, around the Moretti family’s dining
table.
“Klein, why do you need to be at work so early as a consultant?
Would emergency matters at the security company be more
dangerous?” Benson forked a potato from a dish of potato-stewed
beef as he raised the matter in concern.
Klein carefully spat out the bones from a pan-fried dish and gave his
prepared answer.
“A batch of historical documents needed immediate shipping to
Backlund. I had to be present to handle the handover and make sure
there was nothing missing. As you can guess, the bunch of ﬁst-
swinging bastards don’t know any Feysac.”
Upon hearing his answer, Benson, who had ﬁnished chewing his
food, could not help but sigh.
“Knowledge is truly important.”
Making use of this opportunity, Klein took out the remaining ﬁve-
pound note and handed it to Benson.
“This is my additional payment I received today. It’s time you get
some decent clothes too.”
“Five pounds?” Benson and Melissa said in unison.
Benson took the note and looked at it repeatedly. He said in both
shock and doubt, “This security company sure is generous…”
His weekly salary was one pound ten soli, which meant six pounds
exactly every four weeks. He only earned one additional pound from
this additional payment!
And with that salary, he had managed to support his siblings, giving
them a decent place to stay and allowing them to eat meat two to
three times a week. Every year, they could get a few new clothes!
“Are you doubting me?” Klein deliberately returned with a question.
Benson chuckled. “I doubt you have the ability nor the guts to rob a
bank.”
“You aren’t someone who can lie,” Melissa answered seriously after
lowering her fork and knife.
I-I’m now someone used to lying… Klein immediately felt a little
ashamed.
Although it was a result of the circumstances of his reality, his sister’s
belief in him left him melancholic.
“It was relatively urgent and important today. I also played a crucial
role… which is the reason for the ﬁve pounds,” Klein explained.
In a way, what he said was the truth.
As for the ﬁve pounds that he would be reimbursed with—the one he
would use to join the Divination Club—he planned on concealing it.
Firstly, if he brought ﬁve pounds home again, he would truly scare
his siblings, making them suspect he was doing something illegal.
Secondly, he had to save to buy additional materials to practice being
a Seer and to grasp more mysticism knowledge.
Benson bit oﬀ a mouthful of wheat bread in satisfaction and thought
for more than ten seconds.
“The work I’m at doesn’t need any decent clothes. Well, to be precise,
the clothes at home are suﬃcient.”
Without waiting for Klein to persuade him, he suggested, “With this
additional income, we would truly have savings. I plan on buying a
few books on accountancy and studying. Klein, Melissa, I do not wish
that my weekly salary remain below two pounds in ﬁve years. Heh,
as you know, my boss and manager have shit for brains. Their
mouths stink the moment they open them.”
“Excellent idea,” agreed Klein. He also took the opportunity to steer
the conversation. “Why don’t you read some of the grammar books in
my room? To be truly digniﬁed and to earn a handsome pay, that’s
something rather critical.”
Perhaps, in the times to come, the civil servant examinations will
appear in Loen Kingdom. Preparing ahead of time would give him the
advantage…
Benson’s eyes lit up when he heard that.
“I’ve indeed forgotten about that. Here, let’s toast to a beautiful
future.”
He did not drink rye beer. Instead, he poured clear oyster soup into
three cups and clinked his cup with his siblings’.
After drinking the clear soup, he looked at his sister who was
wrestling with the pan-fried ﬁsh. He chuckled and said, “Aside from
Benson’s books, I think Melissa needs a new dress too.”
Melissa looked up and shook her head incessantly.
“No, I think it’s best…”
“To save it up.” Klein ﬁnished the sentence for her.
“Yeah.” Melissa nodded in agreement.
“In fact, if you do not seek the best fabrics and the newest designs, it
would not be too expensive. We can save up the remaining money,”
said Klein in a manner which did not allow for disagreement.
Benson added, “Melissa, are you planning on wearing the old dress
again to Selena’s sixteenth birthday bash?”
Selena Wood was Melissa’s classmate and good friend. She came from
quite a good family background. Her elder brother was a practicing
solicitor and her father was a senior employee of Backlund Bank’s
Tingen branch.
However, the so-called bash was only a dinner invitation to friends
where they chatted and played cards.
“Alright.” Melissa lowered her head and mumbled a response. Then,
she ruthlessly forked a piece of stewed beef.
After a short silence, she suddenly recalled something and looked up
abruptly.
“Mrs. Shaud from next door got her maidservant to send a calling
card over. She wishes to make a formal visit on Sunday, at four in the
afternoon tomorrow. She wants to get to know her new neighbors.”
“Mrs. Shaud?” Klein looked at his siblings, confounded.
Benson rapped the side of the table with his ﬁngers and appeared to
be thinking.
“Mrs. Shaud from 4 Daﬀodil Street? I met her husband before. He’s a
senior solicitor.”
“Senior solicitor… Perhaps he knows Selena’s brother,” said Melissa
with some hints of delight.
We are at 2 Daﬀodil Street… Klein nodded slightly.
“It’s imperative we get to know our neighbors, but as you know, I
still have to be at the company on Sunday. I only have time oﬀ on
Monday. Please pass my apologies to Mrs. Shaud.”
With that said, he suddenly recalled the neighbors of his former life
when he was young, as well as the neighbors in the apartment from
Iron Cross Street. He was amused as he sighed lightly.
“To have formal visits… Shouldn’t neighbors get to know each other
through natural interaction?”
“Haha, Klein, that’s because you aren’t aware. You have read a lot of
newspapers recently, but you have not broached the magazines
catered towards families and middle-aged women. They placed
families with an annual income of a hundred to a thousand pounds as
middle-class. They promoted it as the framework of the entire
kingdom and praised how the middle-class doesn’t have the
arrogance of the aristocrats and the wealthy, nor are they as crass as
the low-income brackets.”
Benson lightly and happily explained, “These magazines impart many
simpliﬁed ceremonies which the aristocrats practice in their
interactions. As such, it becomes a target of the middle-class. Thus,
this results in the diﬀerences between intimate calls, semi-formal
calls, and formal calls.”
As he spoke, he shook his head and chuckled.
“Typically, gentlemen, madams, and ladies who view themselves in
this class will be very particular about details. They will visit their
neighbors and friends from two to six in the afternoon. It’s known as
a morning call <sup>1</sup> .”
“Morning call?” Klein and Melissa asked in surprise.
Why was a visit from two to six in the afternoon a morning call?
Benson put down his fork and knife, threw his hands up, and smiled.
“I do not know why either. All I did was read the magazines my
female colleague brought. Yeah, perhaps it’s because they wear their
morning gowns to make the call…”
Morning gowns were a form of formal attire worn during Mass or
gatherings. Later, it was considered as formal attire for the day,
diﬀerent from the formal attire for evening functions.
“Alright. Remember to buy some good coﬀee powder and tea leaves
in the afternoon. Buy some muﬃns and lemon egg tarts from Mrs.
Smyrin. We must not ill-treat our neighbors.” Klein chuckled as he
dipped his remaining bread into the meat sauces, grabbed some
potato and put it into his mouth.
…
The next morning was a Sunday morning.
Klein ﬁnished the last mouthful of inferior tea, put down the
newspapers, and wore his halved top hat. Picking up his silver-inlaid
black cane, he sauntered out the door and took a public carriage to
Zouteland Street.
He greeted Rozanne who was planning to sleep in the break room
after ﬁnishing her night duty. After which, he went all the way down
to the basement.
After turning a corner, he met a Nighthawk member, Sleepless Royale
Reideen.
She looked like a cold lady. Her brows were long and slender, sitting
atop large eyes. Her hair was a silky-smooth black.
“Good morning, Madam Reideen,” Klein greeted with a smile.
Royale used her deep blue eyes to glance at him and nodded
indiscernibly in return.
The two quickly passed by each other when Royale stopped and said
with her eyes trained forward, “Ritualistic magic is a very dangerous
thing.”
Ah… Klein was taken aback. By the time he turned around, all he
saw was her departing back.
“Thank you.” He frowned and shouted at Royale Reideen’s back.
After taking a left band, he quickly met Old Neil inside the armory,
as well as Bredt who should not have been there.
“Let’s go to my place. I’ve already received the corresponding
materials. Bredt has agreed to watch the armory for me,” said Old
Neil with a chuckle.
Klein was immediately surprised.
“We aren’t doing it here?”
Old Neil held a silver chest and tutted.
“There’s no space here to practice ritualistic magic.”
Klein did not ask further. He followed Old Neil up to the streets and
took a public carriage to the North Borough’s suburbs.
Old Neil’s place was a bungalow. The garden in front of it was ﬁlled
with roses, golden mint, and other “materials.”
The moment he entered, there was a carpeted foyer. There were two
high-back chairs and an umbrella rack.
Through the foyer was an expansive living room. The walls were
plastered with light-colored wallpaper. The ﬂoors were a dark brown
color. In the middle of the room was a tiny carpet with ﬂoral
imprints and placed above it was a heavy round table.
Surrounding the table were comfortable long benches, single-seaters,
and a piano.
“My deceased wife loved music.” Old Neil pointed at the piano and
mentioned in passing, “The sofa and coﬀee table are in the
bedrooms… Let’s do the ritualistic magic in the living room.”
“Alright,” Klein replied cautiously.
After Old Neil put down the silver chest, he laughed and said, “Let
me demonstrate to you ritualistic magic. Make sure to observe and
remember the ritual.”
As he spoke, he took out a fake goatskin parchment from the chest. It
was specially made and it had strange pictures drawn on it with black
ink that exuded a serene fragrance.
Klein kept watching and ﬁnally discovered that Old Neil was
seemingly, likely, possibly drawing an IOU!
When Old Neil ﬁlled in the corresponding ﬁeld with the number “30”
and the corresponding “£” symbol, Klein could not help but ask out
of puzzlement and confusion, “Mr. Neil, what kind of ritualistic
magic are you doing?”
Old Neil coughed and answered very seriously, “I’ll be using magic to
settle that debt of thirty pounds today.”
You can do that? Klein’s eyes widened as his mouth gaped.
Chapter 51: The Grounded
Ritualistic Magic
Using magic to settle an IOU?
Is he trying to curse his debtor to death or create counterfeit notes?
I might not have a solution to the problem, but I can ﬁnish you
instead?
…
All sorts of thoughts appeared in Klein’s mind as he looked at Old
Neil with an oddly.
He seriously considered the possibility of calling the cops, no—of
informing the Nighthawks.
Old Neil shot a glance at him and said peeved, “I can see ignorance,
foolishness, and the weak and shameless disbelief in your eyes. Didn’t
Dunn tell you the maxim of the Mystery Pryers? Do as you wish but
do no harm!”
Although this maxim originated from the secret and evil Moses
Ascetic Order organization, Beyonders who choose the path of Moses
Ascetic Order have proven that it’s right through their own
experiences. As long as one strictly abides to it and shows the needed
fear and reverence, the risk of losing control will be minimized. The
contrary has similarly been established.
“Your suspicion towards me is an insult to Mystery Pryers!”
“Sorry.” Klein did not hesitate to apologize.
He had indeed forgotten that Dunn Smith had once mentioned the
maxim.
Old Neil was not truly angry. In a blink of an eye, he chuckled.
“A pity. Very few Beyonders choose to be Seers. There is no
corresponding maxim to help you.”
But I have Emperor Roselle’s diaries… Yes, strictly abiding to the
maxim has a hint of “acting…” Klein suddenly came to this thought
as he nodded as if in deep thought.
Old Neil did not continue. He removed the vases and other items
from the round table and placed them in a corner.
Immediately following that, he took out both a crimson red and black
candle from the silver chest. He explained, “If ordinary people
attempt ritualistic magic, they have to follow the results from
astromancy or read corresponding manuals. They have to choose
suitable dates and times. For example, the day representing the
Goddess—the period when She rules over the moon. But for us
Beyonders, especially Beyonders good in this domain, there’s no need
for that. Our acute spiritual perception and potent Astral Projections
are key.
“Of course, if you are not conﬁdent about the ritualistic magic you
are attempting, it’s best to choose a suitable date and time. It can
increase the probability of success.
“Ah right. This is based on a premise. Remember carefully to abide
strictly by the rules!”
Old Neil placed two candles and turned to the side and looked at
Klein, saying very solemnly, “Low-Sequence Beyonders are not strong
enough. Almost all the ritualistic magic they can perform are the
seeking of external powers and help. Therefore, you can only
consider orthodox divinities like the Goddess or the Lord of Storms.
Absolutely— absolutely do not attempt to communicate with the
unknown or unpredictable existences. Even if people believe in them
or the promises recorded are ﬁlled with enticements!
“Believe me, don’t take any chances. As long as you attempt once,
you will go down a slippery slope into the abyss with no return. Any
work or resistance will only slow it down with no way to change the
trajectory.”
“I’ll remember!” Klein said in a deep voice. However, he felt a little
afraid.
My luck enhancement ritual has apparently sought power from an
unknown and unpredictable existence…
Furthermore, I have gained powers capable of pulling people into the
fog that even a senior Beyonder like the Hanged Man ﬁnds
unbelievable. Well… At least I think he is a senior Beyonder…
Thankfully, I haven’t gone mad or have any signs of losing control…
While worrying over this, he proactively changed the subject.
“So, Nighthawks should seek the help of the Goddess?”
“No one will stop you if you pray to the Lord of Storms. However, we
are unable to tell from our ritualistic magic whether He replies with
malicious intent or not. The outcome will be distorted in
unpredictable ways.” Old Neil successfully made Klein give up the
idea in a joking manner.
There was no so-called “best,” only “necessary!”
After his exhortations, Old Neil picked up a crimson red candle and
said, “By using candles made of moon ﬂowers and dark-red
sandalwood, it will represent the Goddess’s identity as Lady of
Crimson in the ritualistic magic.”
He pointed to the black candles and said, “Candles made of night
vanilla and slumber ﬂowers represent the night.”
As he spoke, he placed the black candle on the top left end of the
round table while the red candle was placed on the top right end.
“Why do we symbolize the Goddess with only two candles? She is
also the Mistress of Calm and Silence, Empress of Disaster and
Horror, and Mistress of Calm and Silence.”
Old Neil chuckled.
“That’s right. This is something I wished you asked.
“Before their fall, the Moses Ascetic Order had a very good
relationship with the Church. Their beliefs and results on ritualistic
magic have heavily inﬂuenced us.
“They believe that all objects are numeric. Every number has a
spirituality and in ritualistic magic, 0 represents the unknown or
Chaos. It symbolizes the state of the universe before it was born. 1
represents a beginning, the ﬁrst Creator. 2 represents the world and
various divinities that were produced from His body. 3 represents
contact between divinities and material objects to create all things.
Here, using two candles represents the Goddess while the third
candle is for you.
“Which two candles and which two symbols to have depend on the
intended eﬀects the of ritualistic magic.”
Three begets all things <sup>1</sup> ? All things stem from
three? Klein could not help but recall certain things from his previous
life.
Seeing Klein listen attentively, Old Neil took a third candle and said,
“This is the candle representing ‘me.’ It’s a very ordinary candle
which only has a little bit of mint added. Take note that plants like
roses, lemons, mint, moon ﬂower, night vanilla, and slumber ﬂower
are beloved and cherished by the Goddess.
“Viewing it from another angle, the three candles represent the
bodies, spiritualities and godhood of every person.”
After ﬁnishing the description, Old Neil placed the third candle in the
middle of the round table.
He then took out a bottle of concocted “Full Moon Essence Oil,” a
huge cauldron engraved with the Dark Sacred Emblem, a silver knife
with gorgeous patterns, a cup of water, and a saucer of coarse salt.
“To Beyonders who are not good at ritualistic magic, there is a need
for bells, crystal balls, silver cups, incense or other supplementary
items. However, Mystery Pryers and Seers have no need for that.
These artifacts are already suﬃcient.”
Old Neil placed the fake goatskin parchment with the IOU just below
the cauldron and used a special quill to hold down one corner.
He turned to Klein and said, “Ritualistic magic needs a clean spiritual
environment where you will not be disturbed. And that requires us to
create it. The steps are to ﬁrst enter Cogitation. Focus your mind and
with the supplementary items, draw out our strength, and construct it
around us. For example, Ray Bieber’s house had used Holy Night
Powder while I’ll be using a ritual silver dagger.
“Throughout the entire process, we have to go according to the
outcome we desire to conﬁrm the symbolism and corresponding
incantation. Incantations are best done in Hermes because ancient
Hermes stemmed from Nature. It’s akin to ancient Dragonish and
ancient Elvish. The eﬀects are very direct, lacking the necessary
concealment and protection. It easily causes the caster to fall into
danger. This is also why it has been modiﬁed. However, it’s more
eﬀective.
“Alright, I have to focus on the ritualistic magic. I won’t explain
things to you any further. Pay attention by watching and listening.
Remember any problems and ask me when everything is done.”
“Alright.” Klein took two steps back and trained his eyes on Old Neil.
Old Neil’s eyes rapidly darkened as invisible wind around him spun.
He was silent for a moment, going from left to right, then up to
down, using his psyche to cause friction and consecutively light up
the three candles.
Following that, he picked up the silver knife and stabbed it into the
coarse salt. Then, he chanted in Hermes:
“I sanctify you, blade of pure silver!
“I cleanse and purify you, allowing you to serve me in this ritual!
…
“In the name of the Evernight Goddess, the Lady of Crimson…
“You have been sanctiﬁed!”
After a short but powerful syllable, Old Neil drew a silver knife and
inserted it into a cup of clear water. Then, he raised it and pointed to
the space beyond the round table.
He aimed the blade tip in the periphery and took a step forward,
circling the round table. Every step he took made Klein feel an
invisible energy spew out of the silver knife. It was ﬁlled with
spirituality as it connected with the air, forming a completely sealed
wall.
After walking one round, the altar was completely isolated from its
surroundings.
Old Neil stood in front of the round table and put the silver knife
down. He picked up the bottle of Full Moon Essence Oil and dripped
three drops on the black, dark red, and ordinary candles.
Sizzle!
A thin mist emanated as everything seemed to become veiled in
mystery.
Old Neil put down the glass bottle and looked at the fake goatskin
parchment silently for two minutes. Then, he picked up the quill and
drew a mark he controlled—a square that framed all the content,
indicating that he was in control of the debt.
Following that, he drew another ‘cross,’ indicating that it was
canceled.
Upon reaching this step, he picked up the parchment with one hand
and tapped his glabella with the other to activate his Spirit Vision.
Another invisible and exuberant energy bloomed as Old Neil
whispered a chant:
“I pray for the power of the dark night.
“I pray for the power of the crimson.
“I pray for the Goddess’s loving grace.
“Please provide me with the funds to pay this IOU.
“Night vanilla, an herb that belongs to the red moon, please bestow
your powers to my incantation!”
“Moon ﬂower, an herb that belongs to the red moon, please bestow
your powers to my incantation!”
…
Klein was completely ﬂabbergasted listening from the side. All sorts
of thoughts arose in him.
Such an incantation can work?
Although it was recited from written Hermes…
Isn’t this way too simple and down to earth?
Wouldn’t the Goddess be angry and multiply the debt severalfold?
At that moment, the candlelight lit up suddenly!
After Old Neil ﬁnished his incantation, he closed his eyes for two
minutes. He picked up the Full Moon Essence Oil and dripped one
drop onto each of the three candles.
Immediately following that, he grabbed the parchment and pulled it
close to the candle representing “me.” When it ignited, he
immediately threw it into the cauldron.
Old Neil closed his eyes again as he seemed to sense the burning of
the IOU.
He opened his eyes after a moment and looked toward the black
Sacred Emblem on the cauldron. The parchment was already
completely incinerated.
“Praise the Lady!” Old Neil tapped his chest in four spots, forming the
shape of the crimson moon. Then, he extinguished the candles in the
opposite order as he lit them.
After ﬁnishing everything, he used the silver knife to rip apart the
invisible wall around him.
A huge wind stirred immediately as Old Neil heaved a sigh of relief.
“It’s done.”
“That’s it?” Klein asked in a daze. “Has the IOU been settled? How?”
“I don’t know either. Anyways, it will be settled in a reasonable
manner,” said Old Neil with a smile as he threw up his hands.
This… Klein was unsure what expression or words to use as a
response.
Isn’t this a little unreliable?
Chapter 52: Spectator
“Stop thinking about the bloody IOU. Let’s discuss the ritualistic
magic.” Old Neil put away the candles, cauldron, silver knife, and
other items with a relaxed expression.
Klein really wanted to shrug his shoulders like the Americans in his
previous life, but ultimately could not bring himself to do something
that ungentlemanly.
He turned his focus toward the ritualistic magic and threw out
detailed questions that puzzled him, receiving answers from them.
For example, the incantations had a particular format. As long as
they were satisﬁed and the key meaning was expressed in Hermes,
the rest could be left to one’s creativity. Of course, blasphemy or
disrespectful descriptions were absolutely forbidden.
The mysticism class lasted until noon before Old Neil coughed twice.
“We have to return to Zouteland Street.”
With that said, he grumbled in an indistinct manner, “To get these
bloody materials, I missed my beloved breakfast.”
Klein looked around both amused and puzzled.
“Mr. Neil, do you have a chef? Or a maidservant in charge of
cooking?”
A weekly salary of twelve pounds could hire several servants!
According to the newspapers, with board and lodging provided,
hiring an ordinary chef cost anywhere between twelve to ﬁfteen soli
a week. It did not even need a pound. A maidservant to do
miscellaneous chores was even cheaper. Their weekly salaries ranged
between three soli six pence to six soli. Of course, one could not bear
any hope of them having any culinary skills.
Uh, that’s not right. With Mr. Neil’s debt of thirty pounds, it’s only normal
he doesn’t hire any chefs or servants…
It seems I’ve asked another question I should not have asked…
While Klein regretted his question, Old Neil shook his head without
minding it.
“I often attempt ritualistic magic, research extraordinary items, and
read corresponding documents at home, so I don’t nor is it possible
that I hire ordinary people as chefs, butlers or maidservants. I only
hire someone to clean up the place regularly. And if they are not
ordinary people, do you think they will be willing to do such jobs?”
“I seem to have asked a silly question. It’s possibly because I will not
do anything that involves mysticism at home,” explained Klein in a
self-deprecating manner.
Old Neil had long stood up, wore his round felt hat, and while
walking out the door, rambled on.
“I seem to smell pan-fried foie gras… Once the IOU is completely
settled, I’ll deﬁnitely have one set! For lunch, I’ll deﬁnitely eat
roasted pork glazed with apple juices. No, that’s not enough. I must
have a sausage infused with mashed potatoes…”
You are making me hungry… Klein swallowed his saliva as he caught
up to Old Neil and headed for the nearby public carriage stop.
After returning to Zouteland Street, Old Neil suddenly grunted after
stepping down the carriage.
“What do I see? Goddess, what am I seeing?”
He was suddenly as nimble as a seventeen or eighteen-year-old lad.
He quickly came to the roadside and picked up an item.
Klein leaned close out of curiosity and looked carefully. He realized it
was a wallet with ﬁne workmanship.
With his lack of experience, he could barely tell if the dark brown
wallet was made of buﬀalo skin or sheepskin, but he noticed a small
light-blue logo embroidered on the side of the wallet—a white dove
spreading its wings as if ready to take oﬀ.
That was Klein’s ﬁrst impression. The second thing he noticed was
the stack of paper notes in the bulging wallet.
There were more than twenty gray notes imprinted with black ink—
gold pounds!
Old Neil opened up the wallet and pulled out the notes. When he
looked at it carefully, he immediately chuckled.
“Ten-pound notes. The honorable Founder and Protector, William I.
Wow, Goddess, there’s a total of thirty notes. There’s also a few ﬁve-
pound notes, one-pound and ﬁve-soli notes.”
More than three hundred pounds? That’s a huge amount of money in
every meaning of the word! I might not even earn that much in ten
years… Klein’s breathing turned heavy involuntarily.
As the amount of gold pounds was immense, picking up such a wallet
was equivalent to picking up a briefcase of banknotes in his previous
life.
“I wonder which gentleman dropped it… He can’t be someone
ordinary,” analyzed Klein calmly.
Such a wallet was clearly not a woman’s.
“There’s no need to care who he is,” said Old Neil with a chuckle.
“It’s not like we attempted to divine and take money that doesn’t
belong to us. We should wait here for a moment. I believe the
gentleman will soon be back searching for it. It’s not something that
can be given up no matter who it is.”
Klein heaved a sigh of relief. He had a brand-new understanding of
Old Neil’s morals.
He was rather worried that he would have used the Goddess’s
bestowment as an excuse and paid oﬀ his debt. He was still
wondering how to prevent it and persuade him otherwise.
Is this “do as you wish, but do no harm?” Klein suddenly learned
something new.
The duo did not wait more than a minute by the streets when a
luxurious four-wheeled carriage zoomed over. Its side had a light
blue logo with a dove spreading its wings.
The carriage stopped, and a middle-aged man dressed in a black
formal suit with a bow tie of the same color alighted. He looked at
the wallet, took oﬀ his hat, and said politely, “Sirs, that should be my
master’s wallet.”
“Your logo is proof of everything, but I need to make additional
veriﬁcations. This is to be responsible for all parties. Might I ask how
much money is there in the wallet?” replied Old Neil politely.
The middle-aged man was taken aback as he said in a self-
deprecating manner almost immediately, “As a butler, I do not know
how much money Master had in his wallet. Sorry. Please permit me
to ask.”
“As you wish.” Old Neil gestured for him to do as he pleased.
The middle-aged man walked to the carriage’s side and through the
window, conversed with the person within.
He approached Klein and Old Neil again and smiled.
“More than 300 pounds, but less than 350 pounds. My master does
not remember the exact number.”
Does not remember… That’s really some ﬁlthy rich guy. If I had that
much money on me, I would deﬁnitely be counting it again and again…
Klein was ﬁlled with envy.
Old Neil nodded and handed the wallet back.
“With the Goddess as proof, this belongs to you.”
The middle-aged man took the wallet over and did an estimate before
pulling out three ten-pound notes.
“My master is Sir Deweyville. He wishes to commend your morals.
This is what an honest person should receive. Please do not reject it.”
Sir Deweyville? The one who established the Deweyville Trust? The Sir
Deweyville who provided cheap rental apartments to the working class?
Klein immediately remembered the name.
He was a knight that his brother respected but did not believe was
grounded in reality.
“Thank you, Sir Deweyville. He is a kind and generous gentleman.”
Old Neil did not stand on ceremony as he received the three notes.
After watching Sir Deweyville’s carriage depart, he turned to look at
Klein when he saw that there was no one around. He ﬂicked the
notes and chuckled.
“Thirty pounds. The IOU is settled.
“I said it will be settled in a reasonable manner.
“This is the power of magic.”
…Holy f**king power of magic! That actually works!? Klein was once
again ﬂabbergasted.
A few minutes later, he entered the building’s stairwell and while
heading to the security company, he asked puzzledly, “Mr. Neil, why
didn’t you ask for more money?”
“Do not be greedy. One must take care not to be greedy when doing
ritualistic magic. Temperance is a critical trait needed by every
Mystery Pryer if they wish to live long,” explained Old Neil happily.
…
In a huge ballroom, candles were burning on a few chandeliers,
emitting a fragrance that soothed the minds of people. By the sheer
number of candles, they produced a light in no way inferior to that of
gas lamps.
There were long tables with pan-fried foie gras, grilled steak, roasted
chicken, fried tongueﬁsh, Desi oysters, mutton stew, cream soup, and
other delicacies. In addition, there were bottles of Mist Champagne,
Aurmir grape wine, and Southville red wine. They were all glistening
with a tempting glow under the light.
Servants in red vests carried trays with crystal cups and shuttled
between the gentlemen and ladies dressed both elegantly or
gorgeously.
Audrey Hall was wearing a collared, high-waisted, pale-white dress
with engageantes. Her corset was tightly ﬁtted, while her voluminous
layers were puﬀed up perfectly with a cage crinoline.
Her long blond hair was coiled up in an elegant bun and the earrings,
necklace, and rings she wore sparkled brightly. At her feet were a
pair of white dancing shoes that were stitched with roses and
diamonds.
How many petticoats am I even wearing? Five? Six? Wearing white-silk
gloves, Audrey caressed her crinoline gently with her right hand.
Her left hand was holding a glass of clear champagne.
Audrey was nothing like her usual self, usually placing herself center-
stage of banquets and making her the focus of attention. Instead, she
avoided the bustle and quietly stood in the shadows of hanging
curtains by the French windows.
She took a sip of champagne as she watched the crowd as though she
did not belong.
Count Wolf’s youngest son is chatting with Viscount Conrad’s daughter.
He likes to move his forearm to reinforce what he says. Hmm, the bigger
the movement of his forearm, the more unbelievable his words. That is
something gleaned from experience… He can’t stop trying to elevate
himself by putting other people down. However, he can’t help but feel
guilty. It can be seen by the way he talks and his body language…
Duchess Della has repeatedly covered her mouth while laughing with her
left hand today. Ah, I see. She is showing oﬀ her pure ocean-blue
sapphire…
Her husband, Duke Negan, is discussing the current situation with a few
Conservative nobles. Since the banquet began, he has searched for
Duchess Della once…
They almost never make eye contact. Maybe they aren’t as in love as they
pretend to be…
Baron Larry has made Madam Parnes laugh seven times. That’s very
normal, nothing strange about it, but why does she look at her husband
with guilty eyes? Oh, they have gone their separate ways… That’s not
right, the directions they are headed leads to the garden…
…
In the extravagant banquet, Audrey saw many details she never
noticed in the past.
There was an instant where she nearly believed that she was
watching an opera.
Everyone is a good opera actor… She sighed silently as her eyes
remained limpid.
At that moment, she suddenly sensed something and turned her head.
She cast her gaze onto a dark corner in the large balcony outside.
In the shadows was a huge golden retriever sitting there silently. She
was looking inside at Audrey while half her body was hidden in the
darkness.
Susie… The corners of Audrey’s mouth twitched as her expression
instantly changed. She could no longer maintain her state as a
Spectator.
Chapter 53: Listener
An ancient three-masted sailboat was navigating through a
tumultuous storm in the sea.
It was not fast and its displacement was lacking. With the weather
and the sea looking like a cataclysmic scene, the sailboat was like a
withered leaf separated from its tree. However, regardless of how the
typhoons rampaged or how terrifying the waves were, it continued
sailing peacefully without any signs of tilting.
Alger Wilson stood on the empty deck as he looked at the massive
waves that resembled mountains. His thoughts were a mystery.
It’s going to be Monday again… he muttered silently to himself.
It was the day belonging to Mother Earth, the beginning of a series of
waxing and waning.
However, it meant something diﬀerent to Alger. It belonged to a
mysterious existence forever enveloped in grayish-white fog.
At least I haven’t been reduced to a madman… He stopped looking
around as he gave a self-deprecating chuckle.
At this moment, one of the only few sailors he had leaned over and
asked reverently, “Your Grace, where are we setting course for this
time?”
Alger surveyed his surroundings and said in calm voice, “Pursue the
Listener from the Aurora Order.”
…
The storm subsided as mist emanated. On a strange sailboat with
cannons on board, an eight or nine-year-old boy with soft yellow hair
was looking at pirates around him in fear. They were disorderly—
some enjoyed barrels of beer, some swung around with ropes, others
mocked each other, and some even fought with their ﬁsts.
He turned to look at a black-robed man standing in the shadows. He
suppressed his voice and asked, “Father, where are we going?”
Five days ago was his ﬁrst time seeing his father, a father who
proclaimed to be an adventurer.
If not for the oil painting his late mother left him that conﬁrmed his
father’s identity and the fact that the orphanage had opened its doors
to him, he was absolutely unwilling to leave his hometown and
follow his only kin who was also nearly a stranger.
The man in the shadows lowered his head and looked at his son.
With an amiable expression, he answered, “Jack, I’m bringing you to
a holy place, a holy residence where the Creator once lived.”
“Is that the Kingdom of God? We mortals can only enter by winning
His grace…” Jack had been well-educated by his mother and knew
this much. He was both surprised and fearful about the matter.
Standing in the shadows, the man had an unforgettable jawline as
though he was a sculpture chiseled by the best artisan.
He placed his hand to his ear and made a listening pose. He replied
in a tone that sounded like sleep-talking, “Jack, mortals are a wrong
concept. The Creator created this world and He is everywhere. He
exists in every living being. Therefore, all beings have godhood. Once
the godhood attains a particular level, they can become an angel. The
seven fake gods at present are only powerful angels.
“Look, I can now hear the teachings of the Creator. Ah, how
extraordinary is this revelation! Life is only a tour of the spirit. When
the spirit is suﬃciently potent and resilient, we can ﬁnd our godhood
and fuse with even more godhoods…”
Jack could not understand the complicated description. He shook his
head and asked another question he previously did not have the
chance to.
“Father, I heard from Mother than after the Creator created this
world, He split into all beings and does not exist in actuality. Then,
why does His holy residence exist?”
As a seven to eight-year-old child, he was logical.
The man with the chiseled face was taken aback. He turned his head
away as though he was listening to more murmurings.
Suddenly, he slumped down, knees on the deck. His exposed skin
protruded black shards.
He clenched his head with both hands as his expression warped and
he shouted in extreme pain, “They are lying!”
…
After lunch, having had Old Neil promise him that he would bring
him to the underground market the next time he went, Klein slowly
returned to the Blackthorn Security Company. He chose the two
options of reading the documents in the staﬀ oﬃce and practicing his
abilities or take the opportunity to go out and act as a Seer in the
Divination Club before Captain Dunn stopped him.
However, before he could make the decision, he saw Dunn Smith
walk in. He was dressed in the usual black windbreaker and halved
top hat.
“Captain, any updates?” Klein thought of the whereabouts of the
Antigonus family’s notebook as he asked with concern.
Without showing any signs of fatigue in his gray eyes, Dunn said,
“The facts have corroborated that the Antigonus family’s notebook is
in Ray Bieber’s hands. However, he has vanished completely.
“I have already informed the various Nighthawk teams of this matter
through a telegram. They were requested to pay attention to the
various piers and steam locomotive stations. The ﬁrst batch of
printed portraits was mailed out yesterday afternoon and will be
printed in various major newspapers.”
How nice it would be if there were phones, fax machines, surveillance
cameras, and big data… What a pity. I know how to use all of them and
even understand a little of the logic behind it… Klein exhaled silently.
“But regardless, we can consider ourselves as having found the
notebook. And this is all thanks to you. Of course, it still needs
another round of conﬁrmations. I have already sent a telegram to the
Backlund diocese, requesting them to escort Sealed Artifact 2-049
here. It was once a dangerous item of the Antigonus family. It can
help us know if Ray Bieber is a descendant of the Antigonus family.”
A Grade 2 Sealed Artifact… Dangerous… They can be used with care and
moderation.Klein had originally wanted to ask about the Sealed
Artifact, its special abilities, and the danger it posed out of curiosity,
but he instantly recalled that he lacked the necessary clearance. He
had no choice but to give up.
“May Goddess bless us.” Klein tapped four spots on his chest, forming
the sign of the full moon.
Dunn pushed open the door to his oﬃce and said with a slight nod,
“The Goddess has always been protecting us. Klein, if you had not
chosen Seer, you would be a formal member after this matter is
veriﬁed. You could have chosen Sleepless, but pity… To be frank, I’m
still puzzled over your choice. Although Corpse Collector is quite oﬀ-
putting, you have seen Daly as well. You should know that Spirit
Mediums vary in strength. As for Mystery Pryers, they’re a good
choice too. At the very least, you have Old Neil as a role model, so he
will make sure the risk of losing control is minimized.”
With regards to this question, Klein had prepared an answer from the
beginning. He just never had a chance to use it since Dunn did not
ask. He was only able to answer in passing.
He organized his words and said, “My considerations stem from the
fact that Seers and Mystery Pryers are considered Beyonders with a
support role. They do not need to always face enemies for that’s too
dangerous. And both you and Old Neil said that in the domain of
mystery and Beyonders, curiosity and experimentation usually brings
about terrifying outcomes. Describing Mystery Pryers as prying
mysteries made me worried, so… Heh, as you know, I was only an
ordinary graduate not long ago. A lack of guts is the only reason I
made such a choice.”
“I have to say that this is a very reasonable answer that goes beyond
my expectations.” Dunn massaged his temples and chuckled.
He turned halfway as his gray eyes sized up Klein.
“Continue going out for now. Do not limit yourself to the paths
leading from Welch’s place to Iron Cross Street. Perhaps you might
sense the notebook and help us conﬁrm Ray Bieber’s location.”
“Alright.” Klein realized that he no longer need to be in a dilemma.
He bade Dunn farewell and turned around, his heart beginning to
count.
Three, two…
“Hold on,” shouted Dunn.
Klein turned his head and smiled.
“Captain, is there anything else?”
Dunn coughed slightly and said, “Well, support Beyonders have to
ﬁght their enemies from time to time. Although Seers sound like they
can avoid such battles, they are not to be ignored. You have to
maintain your shooting skills and work on increasing your strength.”
“This is what I’m working hard towards.” Klein pointed outside. “I’ll
be leaving.”
“Alright. Uh, wait a moment.” Dunn shouted for him once more. As
he pondered, he said, “Perhaps I have to consider hiring a combat
trainer for you. Of course, this matter is under the premise that you
become a formal member.”
Klein responded tersely before asking carefully, “Captain, is there
anything else?”
“No.” Seeing Klein’s unbelieving eyes, Dunn shook his head and
smiled. He emphasized again, “Really, nothing.”
Only then did Klein walk past the partition divider. He bade farewell
to Rozanne and Mrs. Orianna and headed to the Shooting Club for
practice.
With all of this done, he went to the Divination Club and saw the
beautiful Angelica standing there reading newspapers leisurely.
“Home”… Klein silently read. With the cane in hand, he walked over
and greeted with a smile,
“Good afternoon, Madam Angelica.”
“Good afternoon, Mr. Moretti.” In no rush, Angelica put down her
magazine. She stood up and said, “Not long after you left yesterday,
Mr. Glacis came. He just recovered from a major illness.”
Klein heaved a sigh of relief as he smiled.
“That sure is something worth celebrating.”
Upon hearing this, Angelica, who was secretly observing him,
lowered her voice and asked out of curiosity,
“Mr. Glacis said that you are a very, very, very magical doctor. Are
you?”
What? Klein looked at the lady in front of him, suspecting if he was
hearing things.
What made him think I’m a doctor?
Even I do not know…
Chapter 54: The First Divination
Requester
Upon seeing Klein’s odd expression, Angelica immediately felt her
beliefs waver.
“Is that so? Mr. Glacis mentioned that you were able to tell of an
ailment in his lungs simply from observation…”
Her voice softened until she ﬁnally shut up.
Observation? A dark glabella? Klein was instantly enlightened as he
shook his head with a chortle.
“I believe Mr. Glacis was mistaken.”
He was planning on being perfunctory, but after recalling that no one
sought his divination services the entire afternoon yesterday, his
mind whirled. It aﬀected his goal of acting as a Seer, so he explained,
“It’s actually a form of divination.”
“Divination? But Mr. Glacis only mentioned that you observed his
face. That’s also considered divination?” asked Angelica in shock and
doubt.
Klein smiled, composed.
“As a member of the Divination Club, you should know about palm-
reading, right?”
Palm-reading was not patented by the Foodaholic Empire. Even on
Earth, India and old Europe had developed similar principles, much
less in a world with Beyonder powers.
“I know about it, but it seems you did not read his palm? Were you
observing him in secret?” asked Angelica curiously.
“I was using face-reading.” Klein cooked up a lie. “Its principles
aren’t very diﬀerent from palm-reading at a fundamental level.”
“Really?” Angelica’s eyes were ﬁlled with disbelief.
In order to develop his career as a Seer, Klein chuckled. He pretended
to be in thought as he tapped his glabella twice.
He focused his eyes and Angelica’s aura presented itself. Her head
was purple, her limbs were red, her throat was blue… There was no
problems with her health except for some colors being duller.
However, that was a manifestation of ordinary fatigue.
Klein then looked at her emotions. She saw orange mixed in with
some red and blue. It also meant warmth coupled with some
excitement and thought.
Thankfully… After realizing that there was nothing abnormal about
her, Klein planned on deactivating his Spirit Vision. But it was at that
moment when he suddenly saw rich darkness hidden in the depths of
her emotional colors.
Furthermore, she is lacking a little of white—an eagerness to improve…
Klein nodded while in thought.
“Mr. Moretti, were you reading my face?” Seeing the young
gentleman in black in front of her turn silent abruptly while seriously
sizing her up, Angelica keenly noticed something. She asked in a half-
curious and half-worried manner.
Klein did not immediately reply. Instead, he tapped his glabella
lightly as he wore a look of scrutiny.
Just as Angelica was feeling unease, he said warmly, “Madam
Angelica, there are some sorrows and pains which you should not
seal in your heart.”
Angelica’s eyes widened as her mouth turned agape. However, she
did not say a word.
She looked at Klein in his halved top hat with an apparent scholarly
bearing. He heard him use a deep, comforting and warm voice to say,
“You need to either go mountain climbing, a game of tennis, or
perform a tragic play to exhaust your body due to exercising. Let
your tears ﬂow down uninhibited, then cry and scream. Express all
those emotions.
“That will be very helpful to your health.”
The moment those words entered her ears, Angelica felt like she had
transformed into a statue. She stood there motionless.
She tried hard to blink as she lowered her head in a ﬂuster, saying
deeply, “Thank you for your suggestion…”
“It seems like there are many members here today?” Klein did not
continue. As though he had not done any divinations prior, he turned
to his side and looked to the meeting room at the end of the corridor.
“Sunday afternoon… at least ﬁfty members…” Angelica’s voice
sounded a little hoarse. She only mentioned the key terms.
She paused as her vocal pace gradually returned to normal.
“Do you want tea or coﬀee?”
“Sibe black tea.” Klein nodded slightly. He politely took oﬀ his hat
and slowly walked to the meeting room.
Only when he vanished behind the door did Angelica exhale slowly.
…
The Divination Club’s meeting room was very large. It was nearly
twice the size of Klein’s high school classroom.
In the past, only ﬁve or six members would be present, making it
look extremely empty. Now, there were dozens of fortune-tellers
sitting in diﬀerent spots. They ﬁlled up most of the room.
Sunlight shone into the room through the few oriel windows. The
members were either discussing softly among themselves or asking
Hanass Vincent questions. Otherwise, they were practicing and
attempting divination or drinking coﬀee and reading newspapers by
themselves.
Such a scene made Klein feel like he was back to his schooling days
on Earth. The diﬀerence was that it was noisier and more rowdy back
then, without the tranquility of the meeting room.
He looked around, but he didn’t see familiar faces like Glacis or
Edward Steve. So, he casually picked up a divination textbook, found
a corner, and started ﬂipping through it leisurely.
Very soon, Angelica came in with a cup of tea and left it on the table
before Klein.
As she was leaving quietly, she suddenly saw Mr. Moretti take out an
exquisite-looking silver chain from his left sleeve. There was a chunk
of pure topaz hanging on the silver chain.
What is he doing? Angelica slowed down subconsciously and focused
her gaze at Klein.
Klein held the silver chain with his left hand and allowed the topaz to
hang above the Sibe black tea, just short of touching the surface of
the liquid.
With a serene expression, he half-closed his eyes and the atmosphere
around him suddenly turned quiet.
The topaz started moving slightly, along with the special looking
silver chain, in a clockwise direction.
Upon seeing this, Angelica found Mr. Moretti extremely mysterious.
“The black tea you provide is great,” Klein said softly after he opened
his eyes with a smile.
His actions were intentionally done for Angelica to see!
If he wanted people to select him for his divination services,
Angelica’s recommendation was a very crucial factor!
Since he wanted to act as a Seer, Klein no longer had any
reservations. He completely personiﬁed the identity.
“Yes, Mr. Vannas is very picky about the quality of tea,” Angelica
said, stunned.
Klein put away his spirit pendulum by winding it properly. Then, he
raised the white porcelain cup with ﬂoral design. With a smile, he
gestured politely at her with his cup.
…
Angelica returned to the reception hall, but she no longer had the
mood to read magazines. She sat there, gazing into the distance. It
was a wonder what she was thinking about.
This continued until there were knocks on the door. She jolted awake
and hurriedly looked at the entrance, only to see a lady dressed in a
light-blue dress.
The lady took oﬀ her veiled hat with a powder blue ribbon. She
looked calm and melancholic.
“Good afternoon, esteemed lady. Would you like to join the
Divination Club, or are you looking for a divination?” Angelica asked
like clockwork.
“I want a divination.” The lady had a beautiful pair of eyes hidden
with sorrow, and she bit her lower lip as she spoke.
Angelica guided her to the sofa and explained to her how the
Divination Club worked in detail.
She picked up an album and handed it over.
“You can pick anyone.”
In her low spirits, the lady ﬂipped through the album seriously. As
there were too many club members there that day, there were too
many choices. It left her quite upset.
“Can you recommend one? From these few pages.” She pointed at the
middle section of the album, omitting the fortune-tellers priced above
two soli and those below four pence.
Angelica took the album and looked at it for a few minutes. She
deliberated her words before saying, “I suggest this gentleman.”
The lady who looked uneasy took a glance and realized that it was a
fortune-teller named “Klein Moretti.”
“Mr. Moretti just joined the club… Is his divination reliable?” she
asked worriedly.
Angelica nodded with great aﬃrmation.
“Another member of the club and I are certain that Mr. Moretti is an
outstanding fortune-teller. If it wasn’t for his just joining the club, he
wouldn’t take such low fees.”
“I understand.” The depressed girl nodded. “I’ll pick Mr. Moretti for a
divination then.”
“Alright, please hold on for a second.” Angelica took the album and
walked towards the meeting room.
She came next to Klein and said with a suppressed voice, “Mr.
Moretti, someone wants you to divine for them. Which room would
you like to use?”
That was eﬀective. My ﬁrst “business” is here. Klein put down his
teacup and nodded calmly as he said, “Topaz room.”
“Alright.” Angelica walked slowly ahead of him and led him to Topaz
room before opening its wooden door.
Klein sat behind the table that had various divination tools on it. He
waited less than a minute before he saw a woman in a light-blue
dress walk in. She looked down and melancholic.
Seizing the opportunity when she was closing the door, he tapped his
glabella twice.
The yellow color in her stomach seems a little dull… The dark color of her
emotions is very heavy, mainly worry and anxiety. Klein looked her over
carefully and leaned backwards. He then lifted his hand to cut oﬀ his
Spiritual Vision.
“Good day, Mr. Moretti.” The woman in the light-blue dress sat
down.
“Good afternoon, how may I address you?” Klein asked politely, not
carrying much hope of getting an answer.
As a keyboard warrior, he knew that many people were not willing to
use their real names during divination.
“You can call me Anna.” The girl put her veiled cap aside. She looked
at Klein with mixed anticipation and doubt, and said, “I would like to
divine about my ﬁancé’s situation. He traveled to the Southern
Continent in March for a business deal. He sent me and his family a
telegram last month on the third, saying that he was going to set sail
and return. But he did not return after twenty days. At ﬁrst, I
believed that his delay was due to the Berserk Ocean’s weather, but
as of today, it has been more than a month. The ship he took, the
Alfalfa, still hasn’t arrived at Enmat Harbor.”
The ocean that separated the Northern and Southern continent was
called the Berserk Ocean. It was well known for natural calamities
and its countless dangerous currents. If it was not for Emperor
Roselle, who sent men to discover a few safer sailing routes, countries
in the Northern Continent would still have yet to enter the age of
colonization, let alone lay an underwater cable to complete a
transoceanic telegraph.
Klein looked at his very ﬁrst client of his career as a Seer and asked
carefully, “Which divination method do you wish to use?”
Chapter 55: Revelation
Anna, with her beautiful eyes, hesitated for more than ten seconds.
“You can choose any type that you believe will be accurate. You are
the fortune-teller, while I’m not. Of course, apart from cards,
including tarot, I have also attempted studying them at home. I
always felt they were more like toys or a game.”
Klein thought for a moment, his wrists leaning on the edge of the
table. He steepled his hands before his face, his gaze peaceful. He
said softly, “Then we shall use the astrolabe.”
He pointed to a fountain pen and stack of white paper on the table
and said, “Write down the name of your ﬁancé as well as his facial
features, address, and date of birth. It would be even better if you can
remember the speciﬁc time he was born.”
From her clothes, makeup, and demeanor, Klein did not believe that
she was illiterate.
Anna did not reply. She extended her hand and took a piece of paper.
She lifted the pen and dipped it in some ink. She started writing,
pausing occasionally to think.
Two minutes later, she pushed the paper toward Klein.
Klein received it and turned it around. The information on the paper
read: “Joyce Meyer, 15th September 1323, 2:00PM. Tingen City, East
Borough, 8 Stevens Street. Short blond hair, aquiline nose…”
With just a short glance, Klein quickly calculated the person’s
spiritual number:
1+5=6
In the study of Spirit Numerology in mysticism, adding the numbers
of the day the person was born was called their Birth Day Path
Number, aﬀecting the person’s life before 27. Birth Month Path
Number (calculated by adding the numbers in their birth month)
aﬀected their life from 27 to 54 years old, while the Birth Year Path
Number (calculating the numbers in their birth year) aﬀected their
life from 54 years old onward.
It was July 1349, so Joyce was not yet 27; thus, Klein immediately
calculated the Birth Day Path Number.
The number six represented a balanced and harmonious life, with a
heart for giving and a decent marriage or engagement.
Following this, he quickly calculated Joyce’s Year Path Number.
The so-called Year Path Number was calculated by replacing the birth
year with the current year. The digits were then added with his Birth
Day Path Number and Birth Month Path Number to get a general
understanding of the person’s luck for the year.
1+3+4+9=17, 1+7=8; 8+9 (Birth Month Path Number)+6
(Birth Day Path Number)=23; 2+3=5; His Year Path Number is 5,
signifying that he would meet with change and accident. He would
be required to take certain risks… Klein made a silent judgment after
consolidating the facts. He conﬁrmed that the information Anna gave
was correct.
He retracted his gaze from the paper and turned it toward Anna, “Mr.
Meyer set oﬀ on his journey on the 3rd of June?”
“If he did not lie, that is indeed the case.” Anna bit her lips.
“Alright.” Klein took the fountain pen and made a note of that.
He looked at Anna with his dark brown eyes and said gently, “I will
begin creating the astrolabe now. I will need some time and absolute
silence; do you mind waiting outside? Angelica will provide you with
a cup of tea or coﬀee.”
“Alright.” Anna knew that some fortune-tellers had their
eccentricities, so she stood up unsurprised. She took her hat with the
light blue ribbon and left the Topaz room.
Klein locked the door and returned to the table. He followed the
information and set up the astrolabe, including elements such as his
horoscope and locations of the corresponding planets and stars.
Throughout the entire process, he did not open the Astromancy
Manual. He completed the set up based on his memory.
Over the past few days of his mysticism studies, Klein realized that he
could easily grasp and understand anything about divination, quickly
turning it into instinct.
Perhaps that is the ability of a Seer… He completed the astrolabe and
felt satisﬁed. He felt as though his body, heart, and soul had relaxed
considerably.
As he looked at the outcome, he followed the path of the horoscopes
and planets, as well as other supporting details to roughly deduce
that Joyce Meyer had met with an accident but would ultimately
survive it.
At this point, the divination was technically complete. But Klein
wanted to pay much attention to his ﬁrst business transaction. He
hoped to build a reputation to aid in acquiring future jobs. He picked
up the pen and wrote a sentence in Hermes: Joyce Meyer’s current
situation.
He read the sentence silently and memorized the information on the
piece of paper, repeating it again and again.
After seven times, Klein grabbed the piece of paper and leaned back
into his chair.
He imagined the sphere of light, and his eyes became darker,
allowing him to quickly enter a state of Cogitation.
The surroundings took on an ethereal quality. A formless, boundless
fog stretched above him.
Klein recalled the contents of the piece of paper, then relaxed. He fell
into a deep sleep in this state.
He was using a dream divination technique!
Repeating the question, remembering the details, and then allowing
his Astral Projection to roam the spirit world in a dream would allow
him to gain revelations!
Ordinary people also had this sort of experience sometimes, but it
was hard for them to recall, as the signs in their dreams were more
complicated and garbled. A Seer would not have such a problem, for
they could see the images directly.
The surroundings began to turn hazy as Klein turned half asleep.
In the contorted fantasy, he saw a blond young man with an aquiline
nose. He was swimming frantically in a sea of blood, nearly engulfed
by the waves. But in the end, he managed to escape to shore.
The image shattered and changed. Klein saw a blue house with a toy
windmill at the door. That blond young man was entering the house
slowly, seemingly in joy.
At this moment, the image changed once again. Klein realized that he
was inside a magniﬁcent palace.
The walls were destroyed and damaged beyond repair. Moss and
weeds grew in multiple areas. Through the holes in the walls, he
could see a mountain peak and clouds clinging close to it outside.
Atop the palace was a huge throne carved out of stone. It was
adorned with dull gemstones and gold. It looked as though it was not
prepared for a human.
This giant throne was empty and mottled, as if it had been washed
over by the ages.
Klein looked around in confusion. He did not understand why he
would be dreaming of such a scene.
His turbid mind turned sharp as he subconsciously walked out of the
palace in an attempt to ascertain where he was.
Suddenly, he felt a gaze fall upon him. It was a gaze that came from
behind!
Klein suddenly turned around and stared towards the giant stone
throne, only to see a scene of countless transparent maggots slowly
twitching and growing.
Klein gasped.
He opened his eyes and woke up from his dream.
Crystal balls, tarot cards, and the prepared astrolabe entered his
vision. Reality quickly replaced fantasy.
The initial dream was the result of the divination, but what was the
later dream about? It seemed to be targeted at me? Klein put the
piece of paper down. He rubbed his temples and contemplated.
He could conﬁrm that it wasn’t his fear projecting itself in the form of
a dream, for he was doing the divination himself.
A palace not meant for humans on the peak of a mountain… The
silent stare… The contorted and weird scene of the maggots… Klein
silently guessed as he recalled.
Has the luck enhancement ritual communicated with that existence?
Or is it a result of the Antigonus family’s notebook… Right, that
notebook mentioned the Nation of the Evernight in the Hornacis
mountain range! The palace in the dream was on a mountain peak!
He made a simple deduction and was relieved that he had picked
Seer. According to Old Neil, Mystery Pryers could also divine through
dreams, but they weren’t as eﬀective as a Seer.
Sigh, it sure isn’t letting me go… All I can hope for is the early
capture of Ray Bieber… Klein collected himself and picked up the
piece of paper with the diagram of the astrolabe. He slowly walked
towards the door.
He opened the door and headed to the reception area. He saw Anna
looking out the window, completely ignoring her cup of black tea.
“Ah, Mr. Moretti, is there a result?” She saw Klein in her peripheral
vision and stood up in a hurry.
Klein did not answer her immediately. Instead, he asked according to
the revelation he received from the dream, “Does your house, or Mr.
Meyer’s house, have a toy windmill?”
Anna’s eyes widened, shocked into silence.
After a while, she muttered, “That was a present he gave me. It is by
the door at my house. How did you know that…”
C-can this be divined?
Klein smiled and spoke with a gentle tone, “Congratulations Miss
Anna, Mr. Joyce Meyer is currently a guest at your place. If you rush
back, you should still be able to meet him. He just experienced a
calamity, an unimaginably painful journey. What he needs now are
not questions, but consolation and a warm hug.”
“Really?” Anna asked in disbelief.
The fortune-tellers she knew would never speak with such certainty
or give such ﬁrm conclusions.
“You will know if you go back immediately,” Klein replied with a
gentle tone and smile.
“Oh, Lord of Steam, is that true? Has my poor Joyce returned? Are
you certain? No, I cannot believe it…” Anna froze for a moment and
said a few delirious words.
She took out a one-soli note from her purse and did not wait for Klein
to give her the change. She broke into a small jog as she left the
Divination Club, taking a carriage back home.
“Does this include my tip?” Klein looked at the note and shook his
head with a laugh.
…
A two-wheeled carriage steered quickly across the streets and entered
East Borough.
Anna watched the streets sweeping past her, feeling a mixture of
unease, anticipation, and fear. It did not take long before the toy
windmill entered her ﬁeld of vision.
She got oﬀ the carriage, showing no care for her bearing. She
staggered quickly towards the door and rang the doorbell.
The door creaked open, revealing a blond young man dressed in a
black formal suit. He was haggard, but his eyes carried a glint of joy.
He had an aquiline nose.
“I thought that I would miss you today,” Joyce said with a smile.
“…Oh, Exalted Steam, you really are back!” Anna rubbed her eyes,
exclaiming in pleasant surprise.
What the fortune-teller said was true!
No, that was a real seer!
It was simply fascinating!
Thoughts welled in her mind as Anna pounced forward with tears in
her eyes and gave her ﬁancé a warm hug.
The two of them hugged silently outside the grayish-blue house. The
toy windmill turned slowly, seemingly tossing all their diﬃculties far
away.
Chapter 56: Escape from the Sea
In a rather spacious living room, Anna and Joyce were seated on
diﬀerent sofas, separated by Anna’s parents.
Joyce sighed with a satisﬁed expression and said, “Exalted Steam, I
am so lucky to come back alive, to be able to see Anna again.”
“My poor Joyce, what happened?” Anna couldn’t help but ask with
concern.
Joyce took a glance at his ﬁancée, and his expression turned grave.
“I still feel terriﬁed to this day. I keep waking up from my dreams
again and again. Five days after the Alfalfa left Caesar Pier, we came
across pirates, scary pirates. The only fortunate thing was that their
leader’s name was Nast.”
“The pirate that calls himself the King of the Five Seas?” Anna’s
father, Mr. Wayne, asked in shock.
Although Joyce had already been there for half an hour, he did not
volunteer details about his ordeal. He appeared to be fearful,
perturbed, and uneasy. It was only after Anna returned and hugged
him that he ﬁnally appeared to put it behind him.
“Yes, due to his declaration of being a descendant of the Solomon
Empire, the King of the Five Seas, Nast didn’t believe in killing
captives. Hence, we were only robbed and didn’t lose our lives. His
subordinates even left us suﬃcient food,” Joyce said as he recalled
the ordeal.
His body started to quiver, but he continued to describe his deepest
and scariest nightmare.
“I didn’t lose much of my wealth. I believed that my misfortune was
over, but as we continued towards our destination, a heated conﬂict
erupted among the Alfalfa’s passengers and crew. From disagreement,
to ﬁghting, to drawing revolvers, and raising swords to kill each
other… I saw nothing but blood during that period. One after
another, people beside me fell with eyes opened, never to be closed.
Their limbs, hearts, and intestines were scattered across the ﬂoors.”
“Those of us who were unwilling to turn into savage beasts, the
rational group, had nowhere to hide and nowhere to escape. We were
surrounded by deep blue waves and the boundless ocean… Some
wailed, some begged for mercy, some sold their bodies, but their
heads were hung from the mast either way.
“Anna, I reeled in despair back then. I thought I would never see you
again. Fortunately, in such a nightmare, there was still a hero. The
captain took us to hide in the sturdy keel of the ship, and we relied
on the stored water and food there until the maniacs reached their
limits. Mr. Tris encouraged us, courageously leading us in an assault
against those murderers…
“After an unforgettable bloody battle, we survived. But the Alfalfa
strayed oﬀ course, and only a third of the original sailors remained.”
…
When he depicted the most horrible and darkest side of the human
psyche, Joyce couldn’t help but recall the “hero,” the man that called
himself Tris. He had a round and amiable face. He was shy like a girl
and enjoyed staying in a corner. Only people whom he was familiar
with knew that he was a very good conversationalist.
But it was such an unremarkable boy who stood in front of everyone
with determination in the worst of days.
“Oh, Exalted Steam, my poor Joyce, you went through such a
heartbreaking ordeal. Thank God, praise be to God, He prevented us
from eternal separation.” Tears welled up in Anna’s eyes as she
constantly dotted three points to form a triangle, the Sacred Emblem
for Steam and Machinery.
Joyce revealed a faint pale smile.
“This is the reward for our faith. The Alfalfa then went through
storms, lost its course, and after surmounting one challenge after
another, arrived at Enmat Harbor.”
“Due to the bloodbath that had taken place on the boat, those of us
that survived were held captive by the police and questioned
separately. We didn’t have a chance to send telegrams home to
update our loved ones. When they released us this morning, I
immediately borrowed some money from my friend and took the
steam locomotive back. Thank God for letting me set foot on the land
of Tingen again, allowing me to see all of you again.”
Then, he looked towards his ﬁancée in confusion.
“Anna, when you saw me, I could feel your happiness and surprise,
but I couldn’t understand why you rushed towards the door so
excitedly right after you got oﬀ the carriage. Heh, I had planned on
giving you a huge surprise.”
Anna thought about what had happened earlier, and continued in
disbelief, “There’s nothing to hide, Joyce. As I was worried about
you, I went to the only divination club in Tingen City today for a
divination. That fortune-teller—no, the seer told me, he said, ‘Your
ﬁancé has returned; he’s in the house with a windmill.'”
“What?” the Wayne couple and Joyce exclaimed simultaneously.
Anna covered her face and shook her head.
“I can barely believe it either, but it happened. Exalted Steam,
perhaps there really are miracles in this world.”
“Joyce, that seer asked me for your name, characteristics, address,
and birth date. He told me he was going to do an astrolabe
divination. Then, he asked me if the house with a toy windmill was
yours or mine. When I conﬁrmed it was mine, he said,
‘Congratulations Miss Anna, Mr. Joyce Meyer is currently a guest at
your place. What he needs now are not questions, but consolation
and a warm hug.'”
“God…” Joyce found it unbelievable and incomprehensible. “Does he
know me? Did someone send him a telegram? Could it be that he is
familiar with the police in Enmat Harbor? No, that doesn’t explain it.
How did he know that I came to your place? How could he possibly
know that you would seek a divination? Did you make an
appointment?”
“No, I made a selection at the last minute,” Anna replied with a
vacant-looking expression.
“Perhaps a good seer needs to be in control of vast amounts of
information, even if it cannot be used any time soon. Perhaps, that is
the fascinating aspect of divination.” Anna’s father, Mr. Wayne sighed
and concluded. “In the known history of more than a thousand years
and in the uncertain Fourth Epoch, divination has existed and has yet
to disappear. I think there must be a reason for that.”
Joyce shook his head lightly and asked, “What’s that seer’s name?”
Anna thought and said, “Klein Moretti.”
…
In the reception lobby of the Divination Club.
As Klein had spoken softly, Angelica knew not to go close. Therefore,
she only saw Anna leave as though she had lost her soul, wearing
shock and confusion on her face.
Angelica briskly walked to the sofa and asked out of curiosity, “Was
the result good?”
She did not dare ask the actual result, afraid of violating the
unspoken rule of fortune-tellers.
“Yeah.” Klein nodded and took out three copper coins from his
pocket. “One-eighth of one soli is one and a half pennies, right?”
“Yes.” Angelica looked at the copper coins and realized that one of
them was a penny and two of them were halfpence. She quickly held
it out and said, “There’s an additional halfpence.”
Klein smiled faintly and said, “Thank you for taking care of my
customer. She gave me a tip, so it’s only right I give you one.”
It ‘ s also to thank you for recommending me… he added in his heart.
“Alright.” Angelica felt an unknown fear of Klein, but since the
reason was appropriate, she didn’t refuse the oﬀer.
Klein returned to the meeting room, believing that there would be
more people requesting his divinations.
However, he did not receive a second customer by forty minutes past
ﬁve.
It wasn’t because the Divination Club’s business was poor, but
because most people had already chosen a fortune-teller.
They likely were recommended by others and had long determined
whose services to hire… In short, I’m still lacking in reputation…
Klein laughed at himself for using game terminology.
He ﬁnished his third cup of Sibe black tea, grabbed his top hat and
silver-edged walking stick, and walked leisurely out of the meeting
room.
Angelica suddenly recalled Glacis’s instructions, and she quickly
moved to intercept him.
“Mr. Moretti, when will you next visit the club? Mr. Glacis would like
to thank you in person.”
“I will come over whenever I’m free. If fate permits us, he will
deﬁnitely meet me,” Klein replied, using the tone of a psychic
charlatan, as though he was in character.
Then, he left the club before Angelica could respond and took the
public carriage home.
When he stepped through the door, Klein found Benson reading the
newspaper and Melissa putting together bits and pieces of gears,
bearings, and springs in the evening sunlight.
“Good afternoon. Did Mrs. Shaud visit?” Klein asked casually.
Benson didn’t put down his newspaper; instead, he lifted his head.
“Mrs. Shaud’s visit lasted ﬁfteen minutes. She brought some gifts, and
she was very happy with the muﬃns and lemon cake that we
prepared. She also invited us over whenever we have the chance to.
She is a friendly, well-mannered lady. She knows how to carry a
conversation very well too.”
“The only problem is their belief in the Lord of Storms. They believe
that girls shouldn’t go to school, but should be homeschooled
instead,” Melissa complained.
It was obvious that she was very upset about it.
“Don’t mind that. As long as she doesn’t disturb us, she will still be a
good neighbor,” Klein comforted his sister, smiling.
The Loen Kingdom was a multi-religious nation, unlike the Frosac
Empire in the north which only believed in the God of Combat or the
Feynapotter Kingdom in the south which only worshiped Mother
Earth. It was inevitable that the congregations from the three major
churches of the Lord of Storms, the Evernight Goddess, and the God
of Steam and Machinery had conﬂicts in beliefs and customs. After a
thousand years of this, they restrained each other, making
coexistence possible.
“Okay.” Melissa pursed her lips and redirected her focus onto the pile
of parts again.
After dinner, Klein continued revising history. Only when Melissa and
Benson showered and returned to their rooms did he wash up, enter
his bedroom, and lock his door.
He needed to organize and summarize what he had learned and the
problems that he encountered to prevent himself from forgetting or
missing out any critical points. Only by doing so would he be able to
respond to subsequent developments in the future with a clear train
of thought.
Klein ﬂipped open his notebook, took out his pen, and started writing
in Mandarin.
“Why is the key to digesting potions acting?”
Chapter 57: Organization and
Summary
After pausing for a moment, Klein continued writing.
“The essence to resolving the problems with potions is through
digestion, not simply controlling it. This can be understood in a
straightforward manner.
“Merely controlling it would be akin to using the power of potions as
an external tool. A tamed beast no matter how well controlled would
ultimately not be a part of a person. The risk of it turning on them
would be ever present. As for digestion, it is to view the downed
potion as a part of them. They can break it down, fuse with it, absorb
it, and form an overall system.
“I am currently certain of this point. What is more important is how
‘acting’ helps in digestion.
“According to my experience as a Seer today, I can make two
hypotheses. They can be veriﬁed in the future.”
“One: Acting based on the potion’s name changes the state of one’s
body, heart, and soul, making them closer to the remnant headstrong
psyche of the potion’s core. This results in resonance which allows
gradual assimilation and absorption.
“Two: The remnant headstrong psyche spirit of the magic medicine
might be like a computer with complete defensive mechanisms. If one
wishes to attack it and break it down, they will need to ﬁnd a bug,
security hole, or key. The name of the potion provides a
corresponding clue; thus, we can disguise our body, heart, and soul
as ‘part of the system’ through acting, and so we deceive the system’s
defenses. This line of thought is similar to Emperor Roselle’s
description.
“No matter which guess is right, there is no escaping the body, heart,
and soul, for they are the only bridge between acting and the power
of potions.”
Klein put down his pen and looked at the paragraph of text. For a
moment, he even wanted to thank the education he received from the
Foodaholic Empire.
No matter if he chose science or engineering for his further
education, he was equipped with the basics of logical thought.
Otherwise, there was no way he could have become a keyboard
warrior, nor would he have been able to analyze his current
situation.
“Acting might have an eﬀect, but we’ll have to wait and see for the
speciﬁcs,” Klein guessed.
After that, he wrote down his second question.
“Why would a Seer, being more well-learned and professional in the
domain of mysticism, be lacking in means when it comes to direct
combat? Wouldn’t being more well-learned and professional make a
Seer even more powerful, giving them the ability to discover a way to
defeat their enemies?
“The reasons could be…
“First, just like the web novels I’ve read in the past, I have
transmigrated to a game world that has become reality. Thus,
diﬀerent ‘jobs’ come with diﬀerent specialties that have to be
balanced against each other. But up to this point, there has been no
sign of this world being a game, nor are there signs of mission-like
developments. I’ll put this reason on hold, but it’s very unlikely.
“Second, the fundamental law of this world is balance. The Creator
made this world with the core idea of balance.
“Third, potions at the same Sequence level would have the same level
of power. It is the most optimal state based on what our forefathers
found out and summarized. Exceeding this level of power would
make it easier for one to collapse and lose control. Below this level of
power would make it such that one would not obtain the desired
Beyonder powers. Thus, under the situation of a balanced power
level, being stronger in one area would naturally mean that one is
weaker in another area.
“Fourth, everything in this world originated from the same source;
they were formed by the remnants of the Creator. Thus, everything in
this world is technically fragments of the Creator, and the fact that
they have to complement each other would mean that there are
inherent shortcomings to an individual.
“I am leaning towards the third and fourth reasons, but the latter
stems from an unconﬁrmed myth and can only serve as a guide.
“Thus, I shall use the third reason as a guide, and try to ascertain it
using my current knowledge and future studies.”
At this point, Klein had already written two full pages but did not
stop. Instead, he penned a new question.
“From what I learned today, my luck enhancement ritual is
categorized as a classic ritualistic magic.
“Similar kinds of ritualistic magic can be split into three parts, the
ﬁrst being a sacriﬁce that sparks the interest of a corresponding
existence. The second is comprised of incantations speciﬁcally
describing the existence in question. The third is using simple
formatting and symbols to convey what one is asking for.
“Using this as a benchmark to analyze the luck enhancement ritual,
there’s an obvious problem. “There is no third part!
“It has the sacriﬁce aspect in the placement of staple foods and
walking a square in a counterclockwise manner with four steps.
There is also a clear indication who the incantation is for, such as the
phrase, ‘Blessings Stem from The Immortal Lord of Heaven and
Earth.’
“But all I did after was close my eyes and wait. There was nothing in
the ritual that described the goal of enhancing my luck.
“In other words, the corresponding existence has no way of knowing
what the so-called luck enhancement ritual is asking for, and can
only do as they see ﬁt… Do as they see ﬁt…
“What a troll! Isn’t that darn ‘Quintessential Divination and Arcane
Arts of the Qin and Han Dynasty’ too much of a troll?
“I must have had rocks in my head back then for trying…”
Klein stopped writing and took two deep breaths, trying hard to calm
himself down.
He spat out a foul breath and continued writing.
“I can consider re-designing the ritual, making it more complete. The
motive of the ritual shall be to return to Earth, back to the world
with my parents and friends.
“Then here comes the question: was the entity truly acting on a
whim? Or is there a deeper meaning to it?
“Also, is the entity that the descriptive incantations point towards in
this world the same one from Earth?
“If so, the diﬀerence in results between the ﬁrst and second ritual
could be explained as the entity doing as it wishes. But the results of
me appearing above the gray fog during the second and third time,
while being able to connect to Justice and The Hanged Man has
basically no diﬀerences. Why would that be so?
“If the fourth ritual tomorrow afternoon shows me the same stable
results, that would mean that the eﬀects are consistent. That would
mean that the unknown entity has an agenda I do not know about. If
that is the case, adding new descriptions and requests would not get
me a clear response. In fact, it might complicate the ritual and result
in adverse eﬀects.
“Would the diﬀerence between the ﬁrst ritual and the subsequent
rituals—under the premise that the entity I called upon is the same
one—mean that the results would be diﬀerent depending on the
world I’m in? It is like I am using a diﬀerent interface…
“Then how can I design it to obtain my desired outcome?
“If I think that the entities behind the ﬁrst and subsequent rituals are
diﬀerent, some of the questions can be perfectly answered. But
similarly, the stability of the results in the second and third rituals
would mean that the entity I am praying to has a certain agenda, and
there is no way I can change that for the time being.
“The most important question is the identity of the entity that the
ritual is directed. Where is He, and why doesn’t He give me any clues
or guidance?
“Could He be deep in the world of fog?
“Hmm, can I treat Him as an entity in slumber, an entity that would
give ﬁxed responses if I give Him a certain stimulus, but would not
interfere with what I do other than that?
“Then I can introduce a diﬀerent ritual as a stimulus and conclude
whether the feedback I receive is regular. That way, I can ﬁnd the
correct method of returning.
“But the problem lies in the possibility that He is not asleep. In that
case, such tests might result in terrifying outcomes. It might be really
dangerous.
“The ﬁrst attempt must be conducted with extreme caution. The
design must not anger the being…
“What a headache. I need more knowledge.”
Klein sighed and gave a summary.
Finally, he wrote down other miscellaneous items.
“There are always formless voices resonating in my ears, shouting
‘Hornacis and… uh, was it saying Frygrea or Feygrea?
“Hornacis is the mountain range dividing the Loen Kingdom and the
Intis Republic. Its main peak is six thousand meters above sea level.
“According to the records in the Antigonus family’s diary, there
existed a Nation of the Evernight in the Fourth Epoch. Is the Nation
of the Evernight related to the Evernight Goddess—is there any
connection between the two? Are they allies or enemies? Was the
Antigonus family obliterated by the Church of the Evernight Goddess
due to Nation of the Evernight?
“Did I hear murmurings coming from the diary, from the howls of the
Antigonus family over one or two thousand years?
“What then does Frygrea, uh—Flegrea mean?
“An interesting question. To be able to leave behind such a diary, to
leave behind Sealed Artifact 2-049 implies that the Antigonus family
had possession of a relatively powerful Beyonder power. If that is so,
which Sequence did they possess? Was it complete or not complete?
“My realization that the diary is in the hands of Ray Bieber was a bit
of a coincidence, but without any indication of it being arranged,
could my fate really be tied up with that diary’s?”
…
His ideas were penned on the pieces of paper. Klein tried his best to
write down the events he had experienced and his guesses about their
meaning.
He wrote a total of four pages on both sides of each page.
Rip! Klein suddenly tore oﬀ the four pages and read them from top to
bottom, sometimes marking certain sections with his pen, adding a
few sentences at other times.
Time ﬂew quickly. The crimson moon was temporarily covered by
dark clouds. Klein picked up the pocket watch on the table, snapped
it open, and looked at the time.
He put down the watch and took out a box of matches from his
drawer. He lit one and brought it close to the four pages of notes.
The orange ﬂame ignited the edges of the paper and quickly spread.
Klein placed the notes on top of the wooden dustbin and watched the
ashes drop.
He then released his ﬁngers, allowing the papers to fall. In just ten
seconds, everything had disappeared. All that was left was the still-
swirling ash and the charred bottom of the dustbin.
As there was Emperor Roselle’s secret diary in this world, Klein did
not dare leave behind any evidence that he knew how to write
Chinese—if Old Neil and the rest discovered the four pieces of paper
he wrote, he would have no idea how to explain the matter.
And while writing the conﬁdential questions, Klein was worried that
the one paying attention to his dreams would be able to see and
decipher the contents no matter which language he used, be it Loen,
ancient Feysac, or Hermes. Therefore, he could only write notes in
Chinese to organize and summarize. After he was done with the task,
he burned the notes to leave no traces.
And precisely because there was no way of saving, he set up a plan
for himself. He would do this summary once a week just in case he
forgot anything.
As he watched the ashes fall, Klein pulled out a white piece of paper.
He wrote the title: “To my respected mentor,”
He wanted to write to Senior Associate Professor Quentin Cohen,
asking if he had any relevant historical information about the main
peak of the Hornacis mountain range.
Chapter 58: A Train of Thought
The next day, a Monday morning.
Klein, who had the day oﬀ, didn’t leave home. Instead, he gave
Melissa his letter directed to Mentor Cohen Quentin and more than
enough money to buy stamps. He entrusted her with the job of
mailing the letter at the post oﬃce near the Tingen Technical School
where she studied.
After breakfast, he slept in to make up for the lack of sleep caused by
the previous night’s “work.” He only woke up because of his
stomach’s grumblings close to noon.
He heated up some leftovers from the night before and ate them with
a loaf of rye bread. Klein grabbed a newspaper and entered the
bathroom on the second ﬂoor.
Whenever he did that, he couldn’t help but sigh at the lack of a cell
phone.
After about seven or eight minutes, he left the toilet refreshed and
washed his hands. He then returned to his bedroom and locked his
door.
Klein drew the curtains, lit up the gas lamp, and cogitated for half an
hour. After practicing his Spiritual Vision, spirit dowsing, and
dowsing rod for half an hour, he spent another hour mentally
reviewing the mysticism knowledge he had gained recently.
After doing that, he ripped up the old newspaper and crumpled them
into a few balls. He wrote on them, “Moon Flower Candle,” “Full
Moon Essence Oil,” and other names of materials. He followed the
prescribed steps of ritualistic magic in his head in order to master
every little detail. Until he was entirely familiar with it, he didn’t
intend to try ritualistic magic because it was both a waste of
materials and also easily attracted danger.
He repeated again and again until he picked up his silver pocket
watch patterned with vine-leaves and took a glance. He realized that
it was a quarter to three.
He considered for a few seconds and brought the scraps of old
newspapers to the kitchen on the ﬁrst ﬂoor to burn them. While
doing so, he made sure he was in an optimal state of mind as he
prepared for the Tarot Gathering.
Locking his bedroom door once again, Klein didn’t wait for the clock
to strike three. He planned to enter the area above the gray fog ahead
of time.
He wanted to seize the chance to explore the place thoroughly!
As Klein stood in an empty spot in his room and started walking
counterclockwise, he suddenly worried that Justice and The Hanged
Man had yet to enter a suitable environment. He thought of a
particular matter.
Would they be disturbed or discovered?
He had previously mentioned to allow Justice and The Hanged Man
to apply for “leave” ahead of time if they needed to be absent from
the Gathering for some reason such as being unable to ﬁnd time
alone or unexpected circumstances.
It would have been an almost unsolvable problem for Klein in the
past. There was no way he could build an entire server-based Internet
by hand in a diﬀerent world, right? Any technology beyond the
telegram could expose him.
But now, he had suddenly found inspiration from ritualistic magic.
“Ritualistic magic borrows the powers of others by seeking the help
of diﬀerent existences. Similar incantations would make it clear who
it is directed to in the beginning, such as the Evernight Goddess or
the Lady of Crimson. It would be a description of the unknown and
clandestine existences.”
“Then, can I amend the chant and redirect the beginning of the chant
towards myself?”
“Directed at me…”
“This way, even if Justice and The Hanged Man conduct the ritual in
diﬀerent locations, I would receive their messages.”
Klein suddenly felt fresh insight as he began analyzing the likelihood
of the method working.
“There are two diﬃculties. First, I am not an incredibly strong high-
level Sequencer. Even if the description of the incantation was
directed to me, I couldn’t possibly receive the ‘request.'”
“Second, how can I ensure that the description of the chant is
directed at me accurately, and doesn’t stray away and hit some other
unknown existence that ﬁts the description? That would be incredibly
dangerous.”
Klein paced back and forth, deep in thought for a possible workable
solution.
He went in circles with silent footsteps. Then, he naturally linked the
matter with the mysterious world of the gray fog.
“Even if I can’t receive the message, that doesn’t mean the gray fog
can’t. Its connection with the crimson stars can ‘drag’ a person into
the space directly, regardless of where they are in the physical world.
“I could consider tying myself to the mysterious space together
during the directed description…
“In accordance with this train of thought, even though I might not
immediately receive the ‘request’ when the other party is holding the
ritual, I will still be able to see the corresponding messages whenever
I enter the gray fog.
“To put it simply, it is the diﬀerence between being online and oﬄine
on an instant messaging system.”
Klein became more excited the more he thought. He felt that his idea
was worth a try.
“Hmm, what kind of description could be used to precisely direct a
message to me and to the gray fog world?” He started thinking about
the actual details.
In fact, he had an incantation that would deﬁnitely work. It was none
other than the Loen translation of ‘Blessings Stem from The Celestial
Worthy of Heaven and Earth.’ But herein lies the problem: he would
lose control of the gray fog and lose his leading role. He could only
exclude it.
‘Fool from an alternate world’? No way. It is quite accurate, and there
is almost no other existence that ﬁts the criteria, but it would expose
my biggest secret… Klein thought of one incantation after another,
but he crossed oﬀ each one.
After about seven to eight minutes, he ﬁnally decided on the
description of the ﬁrst paragraph that directed to him.
“The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era.”
It was obviously not accurate enough; therefore, Klein quickly added,
“The mysterious ruler above the gray fog.”
The combination of the two lines practically limited it to him.
Furthermore, he had tied the gray fog to him.
“It’s still a little short. I cannot eliminate the possibility that there are
multiple spaces and rulers above the gray fog. I cannot eliminate the
fact that the description might be directed to the spirit world…”
Klein creased his eyebrows and planned on making it more certain.
Hmm… He thought for a full minute and ﬁnally decided on the last
part of the description.
“The King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck!”
It shared a similar meaning to “Blessings Stem From The Exalted
Thearch of Heaven and Earth 1 .” If the incantation purely depended
on that part of the description, it might end up being directed away
and provoking unknown dangerous existences. But with the ﬁrst two
lines as a limitation, and his experience of arriving above the fog
through a similar incantation, he believed that the target’s
description could result in a perfect lock on.
Klein wasn’t sure if casting the ritualistic magic with those three
descriptions would be eﬀective, but he was deﬁnite that it would not
attract the attention of another existence, It wouldn’t throw Justice
and The Hanged Man into danger.
Klein heaved out a long sigh and recited the incantation that he had
decided upon.
“The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era, you are the mysterious ruler
above the gray fog; you are the King of Yellow and Black who wields
good luck…”
He nodded his head slightly and took out his pocket watch to conﬁrm
the time.
“It’s already 2:58…” Without further thought, Klein put away his
pocket and entered Cogitation. Soon he chanted and took four steps
counterclockwise to form a square.
The most ferocious noises and heart-stirring roars were heard once
again. He felt the headache that was even harder to deal with than
the pain of consuming the Seer potion.
The pain was not a sharp pain that tore through his head. It was a
throbbing pain that made him manic and irrational. It was a pain that
left him in chaotic confusion.
Klein controlled himself using Cogitation and tried hard to ignore the
voices.
The muttering and murmurs receded like the tides. His body became
ethereal, along with his spirituality. Everything seemed to ﬂoat.
The boundless gray fog appeared before his sight, the crimson stars at
varying distances from him, just like pairs of eyes.
Above the gray fog stood the palace, lofty and towering like the
home of a giant. It was as though it had been there for millions of
years.
All Klein did was will it and he disappeared from where he was,
reappearing at the Seat of Honor at the long bronze table with
twenty-two high-back chairs.
“The eﬀect of the ritual is deﬁnitely ﬁxed…” Klein muttered. He
tapped his glabella gently and allowed the fog to engulf him, ones
thicker than before. According to the description of The Hanged Man,
if Justice had become a Spectator, it would be best not to reveal any
of his tics before her.
Without any time for exploring, Klein extended his right hand and
formed an invisible connection, connecting him to the two familiar
crimson stars.
…
On the roaring blue waves of the Sonia Sea, an ancient sailboat was
sailing with the wind.
Alger Wilson locked himself in the captain’s cabin and made ghost
ship provide him the best protection.
He opened the pocket watch before him and laid it next to the brass
sextant. The clock was ticking without joy as it exuded nervousness.
When the hour hand, minute hand, and second hand aligned, there
was an explosion of crimson before Alger Wilson. It ignored the
layers and layers of protection he had placed over himself.
Sigh… His sigh reverberated across the captain’s room.
…
Backlund, Empress Borough.
Audrey Hall laid against a down-feather pillow and glanced at the
yellow paper in her hand. Her gemlike eyes looked like they had two
souls spiraling slowly in them.
Her gaze was calm and cool, as if she were waiting for a play to
begin.
As the crimson red erupted, she looked at herself being swallowed
with complete detachment.
…
Above the gray fog, in the magniﬁcent palace, on the ancient and
mottled long bronze table.
Klein, who had already activated his Spiritual Vision, looked over
when Audrey Hall’s ﬁgure began to form. He was not surprised to see
that the colors deep in her aura had blended together. It became pure
and serene, like a lake that was clear and reﬂective.
She really did become a Beyonder… Klein was just about to move his
gaze away when he suddenly saw the chair belonging to Miss Justice
change.
The bright stars on the back of the chair moved swiftly, forming an
illusory constellation that didn’t belong to reality.
That constellation was familiar to Klein because it was one of the
symbols of mysticism.
It was a symbol that represented “Giant Dragon”!
Spectator… Giant Dragon… Klein restrained himself from shaking his
head and looked over at the back of The Hanged Man’s chair.
Typically speaking, it was impossible for him to see the back of the
chair from his angle, but this was where he was in control.
Everything presented itself according to his will.
The constellation on the back of the chair had not changed, but since
Klein had grasped the basics of mysticism, he wasn’t as ignorant as
before. He could recognize that it was the symbol of “Windstorm.”
Sailor… Keeper of the Sea… Windstorm… That’s reasonable. The color
deep in The Hanged Man’s aura is much purer than it was… Has he
leveled up? Oh yeah, what about the symbol behind my chair?
Klein suppressed his impulse to look, rapped the edge of the long
table thrice just like before, and smiled as he said, “Congratulations,
Miss Justice, you are a Beyonder now.”
He can tell straight away? Audrey was stunned and smiled faintly.
“Thank you, Mr. Fool, and thank you, Mr. Hanged Man.”
“That was much faster that I thought,” Alger Wilson said honestly.
Klein didn’t continue the topic but tapped his glabella and said with a
smile, “Lady, Sir, have either of you found Roselle’s diary?”
Chapter 59: Roselle's Origins
Upon hearing The Fool’s question, Audrey did not immediately
answer like in the past. Instead, she widened her crystalline eyes and
glanced at The Hanged Man with a scrutinous attitude.
Alger subconsciously subdued his body motions. After a few seconds
of silence, he said, “I found two pages of the Emperor Roselle’s diary
and have memorized their contents.”
“I have one page,” Audrey, whose vision was obscured by the fog,
said as though she was removed from the conversation.
“Pretty good.” Klein did not allow his joy or his disappointment be
noticed from his voice.
He felt joy as there were three full pages, but disappointment also
because there were only three pages. Their initial search for the diary
was deﬁnitely easier, for all they had to do was ask through their
connections and channels they were already familiar with. Collecting
the pages would become more and more diﬃcult as time went on as
it would involve more and more elements.
“Should we ‘express’ them now?” Audrey inquired with a calm tone.
“Yes.” Klein simply nodded.
He maintained his posture without any change. He had to be cautious
in front of a Spectator.
As he ﬁnished his sentence, pieces of yellowish-brown goatskin
parchment and dark red fountain pens appeared in front of Audrey
and Alger.
The two of them picked up their pens and started to recall the
symbols they had seen. They also infused the emotions of expressing
them out.
Silently, lines of text appeared on the goatskin. Some of them
appeared proper, some delicate, others slanted.
In a mere minute, the contents that Alger and Audrey had forcibly
memorized were all written.
Klein willed the three pieces of parchment into his hands.
He gave the pages a cursory glance and realized that some of the
grammar was wrong. There were also missing and wrong words in
the content.
But experimentation had proved that incorrect sequencing of words
to some extent did not aﬀect the overall comprehension of Chinese.
Klein was also not afraid of missing words since he often read web
novels ﬁlled with censored asterisks.
“8th April. I stood at the bow of Black King and stretched my arms,
saying to Grimm and Edwards, ‘My fortune is yours for the taking,
but you’ll have to ﬁnd it ﬁrst. I left everything I own at the ends of
the Fog Sea!’ They did not understand my humor at all and even
asked if I really had other treasures. How boring. You can’t be my
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse if you keep at that!”
“April 11th. I discovered a nameless island that was not on a safe sea
route. There are a good number of extraordinary animals there, no—I
prefer calling them extraordinary beings; it feels more impressive that
way. Other than that, there are several weird creatures on the island.
I believe that if Darwin had been transmigrated there, there is no way
he could have written his Theory of Evolution.”
“April 15th. Grimm has suddenly become a little odd. Has he been
infected by something?”
When did the Emperor Roselle, who was born in the Intis Kingdom,
set oﬀ on a voyage? The Fog Sea should be the sea west of the Intis
Republic… Yea, I need to use historical information from the library
to cross reference this… Klein quickly ﬁnished reading a page,
casting his gaze to the back of the piece of paper.
At this point, he no longer hid the fact that he could decipher
Emperor Roselle’s secret symbols since this ability ﬁtted the persona
and status of The Fool. Audrey and Alger did not speak. They waited
silently, as if unsurprised by such a revelation. In fact, they even
believed that it was only right.
“October 2nd. They actually wanted me to marry Matilda from the
Abel family without even consulting me ﬁrst! Heavens, I have not
even met her! No, I must decline! Even if I were to run away from
home and survive on my own and suﬀer the vicissitudes of life, I
must ﬁght against this marriage!”
“October 5th. Miss Matilda is really pretty.”
“October 6th. Her personality and her demeanor is just my type. I am
starting to look forward to the marriage.”
Hey, Emperor, where is your integrity? Klein leaned back into his
seat, not allowing his emotions to pass through the fog.
He realized that Gustav did not write in his diary every day early on.
Most of the time, he would only write in the diary when there were
certain events that he needed to lampoon, record, or to vent his
emotions.
He shifted his gaze downward. Klein looked at the last sentence of
this page.
“October 9th. They actually called me the Son of the Steam. I like
that very much.”
Klein was a little disappointed that the information in the ﬁrst two
pages was of little value.
But he did not turn sullen. He moved the third page to the top. This
page had content written on both sides of the paper.
“May 21st. The Church of the God of Craftsmanship gave me two
choices, two beginning Sequence pathways. One of them is the
Savant. It is a complete Sequence pathway they possess. The other is
Mystery Pryer, which they obtained from the Moses Ascetic Order,
but it lacks the higher Sequences.”
“May 22nd. My choice was easy: Savant! The Savant has a complete
Sequence pathway! Although wielding more information on
mysticism can aid my return home, the problem is that if I am not
strong enough, there is a need to acquire external help for
transmigration. And I do not know if this external entity would be
good or bad, benevolent or malicious. I cannot control it, and thus it
could be very dangerous. In that case, why not strengthen myself and
return by relying on my own powers? Thus, the complete Sequence
was the most important factor in my considerations!”
“May 23rd. I have become a Savant. With the power of the potion, I
actually recalled all the knowledge I had learned in the past, such as
physics, chemistry, etc…
“I have not only recalled the knowledge, but I understand it more
deeply, as well as its possible applications and implications. Haha,
this is a ‘job’ specially tailored for a transmigrator like me from an
alternate realm. I will be able to express my advantage to the greatest
extent! I have to say that if I were to return in my present state to the
third year of high school, I would deﬁnitely become top scholar. If I
could further specialize in an area, it wouldn’t even be too hard for
me to become a scientist.”
“May 26th. I am enjoying my status as a Savant. Something odd
worth mentioning. When I address myself as a Savant, doing things
that are in line with this role, the murmurings that drive me crazy
become considerably softer. I have also been able to control my
occasional temper outbursts. I have also recalled the matter regarding
the diary.
“Is this the ‘acting’ that the mysterious Mr. Zaratul mentioned? This
could be key in resolving the side eﬀects posed by potions.”
As Klein read the diary page, he had a deep realization that there was
a fundamental diﬀerence between how he and the Emperor Roselle
did things.
For example, regarding the matter of returning home, Klein
considered grasping in-depth knowledge of mysticism to avoid risks
and accomplish his goal, while Emperor Roselle preferred to rely on
himself and face the risk.
I have to say, I envy people like that sometimes. Perhaps everyone
yearns for something they do not possess… Of course, I also have to
consider strengthening myself; both of these are important, Klein
thought, sighing a little.
The description provided by Emperor Roselle about acting instilled
Klein with conﬁdence that the conclusion he made about acting
yesterday was more or less correct.
He put the three diary pages down, looked up at Justice and The
Hanged Man. He smiled and said, “My apologies, I was too absorbed
in reading them.”
Audrey calmed the envy in her heart and smiled faintly.
“I can understand. I hope to one day be able to exchange information
about the diary’s contents.”
“That will require a price.” Klein smiled and glanced at Justice, then
swept his gaze towards the silent Hanged Man.
Audrey put her palms together and placed them in front of her.
“Mr. Fool, Mr. Hanged Man, I have three questions to ask. If you
think that the answers warrant a high price, tell me what you want, I
will try my best to seek it.”
“No problem,” Alger answered succinctly.
Klein nodded and leaned back further, making himself comfortable.
Audrey thought for a few seconds and said, “The ﬁrst question is,
what does ‘acting’ really mean? I realize that the remnant psyche in
the potion has minute eﬀects on me; is that because I’ve been acting
as a Spectator all this while?”
Alger did not speak; instead, he looked at The Fool, as though
waiting for him to give an answer.
Klein rubbed his ﬁnger on the edge of the table and said in a relaxed
tone, “Let me explain this with an analogy. Imagine the core powers
of your potion as a tightly guarded castle. The remnants of the psyche
that can cause a lash back resides within that castle. Our goal is to
get rid of it and become the true master of the castle.
“There are two ways we can do that. The ﬁrst is to forcefully invade
the castle. There is no guarantee that this will work, and you will
most deﬁnitely injure yourself unless you can suppress it with
absolute power. But of course, we are not equipped to do that.
“The second way is to get the owner of the castle to extend an
invitation. This invitation can allow us to slide through the scrutiny
of the guards and inﬁltrate the castle. We can then easily ﬁnish oﬀ
the enemies. But the problem lies in the fact that this invitation
speciﬁes the facial features and characteristics of the guest. Thus, we
have to disguise ourselves and act as the guest, do you understand?”
Alger immediately asked, as if he had anticipated this reply, “Then
the aforementioned invitation is the name of the potion’s Sequence?”
“That’s right,” Klein answered with great aﬃrmation.
Audrey froze for a moment, having the sudden feeling that she
completely understood what ‘acting’ meant.
She immediately exited her Spectator state due to her excitement.
She praised in joy, “What an exceptional method, I think—I think it
ﬁts your title. Its style is very compatible with The Fool… I would
never have believed that acting would have such an eﬀect. Luckily, I
have been acting as a Spectator the past few days.”
She paused for a moment before saying, “I think that this is a very
valuable answer; my heart is not at ease accepting it for nothing. Mr.
Fool, what do you need in exchange? Of course, I still remember that
I owe you a page of Emperor Roselle’s diary.”
“More pages of Roselle’s diary, or…” Klein paused for a moment.
He had wanted to get information about the Sequence regarding the
Seer but felt that such a low-level request would ruin the mystical
image of The Fool. Thus, he chose to give up on it and planned to ask
them discreetly some other day.
I just advanced recently and have yet to completely digest the Seer
potion… He consoled himself and added on without expression,
“Anything regarding the Antigonus family, even if I’m already aware
of them myself.”
Alger remained silent for a few seconds. He looked at the top of the
long bronze table for a moment before slowly opening his mouth.
“Mr. Fool… I believe I can pay you back immediately with the
information you requested just now.”
Chapter 60: Second Blasphemy
Slate
“No problem.” Klein tried to maintain his unchanging deep tone.
He rested his left elbow on the armrest of his chair and supported his
forehead slightly with his ﬁngers, posing as though he was listening
calmly.
Alger deliberated over his words and said, “The Antigonus is an
ancient family. Their history can be traced back to the Cataclysm
Epoch before the Fourth Epoch and is related to the second
Blasphemy Slate.”
The second Blasphemy Slate? There’s a second Blasphemy Slate? How
many are there? Klein’s pupils shrank, and he nearly changed his
posture.
According to what The Hanged Man and Justice have said previously, the
Blasphemy Slate contained the profound mysteries of the twenty-two paths
of the divine!
There are two of such important items, or even more?
Twenty-two paths of the divine… Sequences and pathways… Could these
two nouns mean the same thing? Every complete Sequence pathway leads
straight to the throne of the divine?
At that instant, the description of the second Blasphemy Slate gave
Klein numerous thoughts. He believed that if not for the thick
grayish-white fog concealing him, his emotional reaction would
probably have been discovered by Miss Spectator.
As for the words Cataclysm Epoch, he was no stranger to that term as
a historian. It was the name of the third epoch.
After his recent revision, Klein even knew that the third epoch was
separated into two eras: the Glorious Era and the Cataclysm Era.
“A second Blasphemy Slate?” Audrey plainly revealed her ignorance
on the matter.
Before she calmed her emotions, she returned to her Spectator state.
Nice question! Klein secretly cheered for Miss Justice.
It was a question inconvenient for him to ask as The Fool.
Alger stole a glance at The Fool and noticed that his posture
remained the same, nor did he make a sound. Hence, he thought and
answered, “The ﬁrst Blasphemy Slate appeared in the Dark Epoch,
which is the second epoch where we humans struggled to survive
under the protection of gods. The second Blasphemy Slate appeared
at the end of the third epoch. It could even be said that its
appearance symbolized the end of the Cataclysm Epoch.
“The content of the two Blasphemy Slates is kept secret by the seven
major churches. I only know bits and pieces of it. I only know that
they involve the pathways to godhood, but I am not sure of the
diﬀerences between them.”
“Was the Blasphemy Slate that Emperor Roselle saw the ﬁrst or the
second?” Audrey asked curiously.
Upon hearing that, Klein recalled what Alger said about the potion
names during the ﬁrst Gathering. He said that the names of the
Sequence potions were derived from the Blasphemy Slate!
Similarly, Captain had also mentioned that the formation and completion
of the potion system was thanks to the birth of the Blasphemy Slate…
That indirectly conﬁrms that the pathways to godhood are the Sequence
pathway! Klein answered his earlier question silently.
Then Alger simply replied, “The second one.”
The glint in Audrey’s eyes diminished and she returned to her
Spectator state. She did not continue asking questions; instead, all she
did was focus her gaze on The Hanged Man.
It was obvious that her scrutiny made Alger uncomfortable, but he
suppressed the emotions within him. He lowered his voice and
continued, “During the Solomon Dynasty in the Fourth Epoch,
although the Antigonus family was considered an illustrious part of
the aristocracy, they didn’t do anything very memorable until they
supported the establishment of the Tudor Empire. They then stood
right in the middle of the stage of Northern Continent.
“In that period, Antigonus, Amon, Abraham, Jacob, and others were
illustrious names of the human kingdom. However, after the War of
the Four Sovereigns, the Blood Emperor from the Tudor Empire
perished. They fell from the top of their pedestal and are now hunted
by the seven gods.
“I am not sure about the actual process, but I do know that the
Antigonus family was destroyed at the hands of the Church of the
Evernight Goddess. Mr. Fool, if you’d like to know more, I am afraid
that you can only obtain the information from the Church of the
Evernight Goddess or from the few ancient secret organizations. You
know which few I am referring to.”
I don’t… Klein nodded while feeling bitter inside.
“Okay.”
The Secret Order is one. Captain and Old Neil mentioned the Moses
Ascetic Order. I wonder if the Psychology Alchemists count…
While he mentally checked oﬀ the candidates, Alger provided him
with the last bits of information.
“I similarly have no idea which Sequence pathways the Antigonus
family held. There are only two adjectives that appear repetitively in
the descriptions of the Antigonus family, and those are “strange” and
“terrifying.”
Strange and terrifying… Thinking back to the notebook, the original Klein
and his classmates, and what happened to Ray Bieber’s mother, it really is
aptly worded…Klein continuously rapped the edge of the long table
with the tip of his ﬁnger a couple of times.
Then, he slowly began to speak.
“Very well, I am satisﬁed with the payment.”
The reason he continuously rapped the long table lightly with his
ﬁngers was to emphasize the action, to make Justice and The Hanged
Man believe that he had a habit of rapping in order to conceal the
fact that the same motion was used to activate and deactivate his
Spirit Vision.
“It’s my pleasure.” Alger did not say anything else.
Audrey took a look at The Hanged Man and then The Fool. She
smiled faintly and said, “Then, I shall ask the second question: what
is the name of the subsequent potion for Spectator? Where can I ﬁnd
the clues?”
I’d also like to ask so straightforwardly, but diﬀerent choices lead to
diﬀerent diﬃculties… Klein did not speak but cast his gaze towards
The Hanged Man.
Alger remained silent for a few seconds before saying, “I’ll answer the
question for free because I led you on this pathway.
“The subsequent Sequence for Spectator is Sequence 8 Telepathic.
The ancient name of Sequence 7 is Psyche Analyst but is called
Psychiatrist now. This is what I found out from a member of the
Psychology Alchemists. I think they should have quite a number of
potion formulas for this pathway.”
Psychology Alchemists… Spirit Medium Daly was rather approving of
their theory, but Captain thought of them as evil and crazy… Klein
listened while in deep thought.
“Do you know the whereabouts of that particular Psychology
Alchemists member?” asked Audrey as her eyes beamed with joy.
Be it Telepathic or Psychiatrist, both names appealed to her
aesthetics.
Alger gave a rare laugh.
“I do. He’s immersed in the seas around Sonia Island. I sank him with
my own hands.
“If you would like to look for the Psychology Alchemists, I have to
apologize since I severed the clues.”
He was not worried that Justice would ﬁnd his identity through his
description because he did that on his own, out of the public eye.
“Sank…” Audrey was at a loss how to reply or what expression to
wear.
She drew a deep breath and suddenly failed to maintain her Spectator
state. She asked bashfully, “The third question. If—and I’m saying if
—a normal animal were to drink a Sequence 9 potion, what would
happen?”
What kind of a question is that? Klein tapped his glabella unnoticeably
with his ﬁnger that was supporting his forehead.
Very quickly, he saw the changes in color and noticed that Audrey’s
emotions had turned frantic, nervous, and a little ashamed.
Could she have done something that stupid? Klein was astounded, but
didn’t ﬁnd it strange.
After the past two Gatherings, he was certain that Miss Justice was
quite an airhead.
The Hanged Man, Alger, was obviously dumbfounded as well. He
took a while to reply.
“Normal animals do not have the brains of humans. They wouldn’t be
able to learn Cogitation in a timely manner. Therefore, it would most
likely lead to immediate death or a breakdown into a monster.
However, if they survived the initial ingestion of the potion, they
should become an extraordinary creature. If the potion has the ability
to enhance their intelligence, they can even become smarter.”
“Alright.” Audrey breathed out a silent sigh and nodded while saying
with a relaxed tone. “I have no other questions.”
Alger considered for a moment and did not mention matters
regarding the Aurora Order or the Listener. Similarly, he shook his
head and said, “Nor do I.”
“I have something.” Klein didn’t change his posture but said with a
smile, “It will require your cooperation.”
He had yet to turn oﬀ his Spirit Vision, and he immediately saw that
The Hanged Man was showing signs of nervousness, while Miss
Justice was too simple-minded to show fear or carefulness.
Before they could reply, Klein comforted them, “Don’t worry. It’s
trivial. If it succeeds, it will be beneﬁcial to you, so I wouldn’t be
paying extra remuneration.”
“Go ahead.” Audrey instinctively entered the Spectator state, but she
couldn’t see through the thick gray fog engulﬁng The Fool.
“As you will,” Alger replied, steadying himself.
Klein moved his ﬁngers and smiled when he said, “Previously, I said
that we would do some experiments to enable you to ask for a leave
of absence. That way, you do not have to worry if you have to be
somewhere inappropriate on a Monday afternoon.”
“That’s our wish.” Audrey loosened her tightly knitted eyebrows.
Alger thought and said, “What do you need us to do?”
“You could try a piece of ritualistic magic during your free time. It
need not be too formal. As long as you are in an environment that
won’t be disturbed… Put four brand new candles on an altar, placed
on four corners respectively. It’s best if they are candles with a
sandalwood scent. Put a loaf of white bread near the candle on the
top left corner, a bowl of Feynapotter noodles near the candle on the
top right corner, paella by the candle on the bottom left corner, and a
Desi pie by the candle on the bottom right corner… Use a silver knife
to make a sealed spiritual environment…”
Klein described his modiﬁed version of the luck enhancement ritual
and taught Miss Justice how to create a spiritual environment for
free.
To be frank, as the ritual was targeted at himself, Klein believed that
the former part, which was intended to attract the interest of an
entity, could be omitted completely. However, he still worked hard to
make the procedure seem important. Of course, it didn’t comply with
what Old Neil taught about gods being second and oneself being
third.
“…Mix moon ﬂowers, gold mint, slumber ﬂowers, ﬁngered citron,
and rock-rose together then distill it. Extract it for its essential oil,
then pour a drop onto each candle…”
Audrey listened with piqued interest as she recorded all that he said.
When he was done, she asked, “What about the incantation? Mr.
Fool, what’s the corresponding incantation?”
Alger stopped writing with the fountain pen in his hand as well. He
turned his head to look at The Fool.
Klein, who was immersed in the gray fog, tapped the edge of the long
table with his ﬁnger lightly and said calmly and monotonously in
Hermes, “The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era, you are the
mysterious ruler above the gray fog; you are the King of Yellow and
Black who wields good luck…”
Chapter 61: Strange Symbol
“The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era… the mysterious ruler above
the gray fog… King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck…”
Audrey Hall recited the three descriptions to herself silently. She
suddenly felt a tumultuous wave of emotion go through her,
preventing her from maintaining her Spectator state.
As an aﬁcionado of mysticism, she had learned Hermes that was used
in rituals and had tested out the rituals that fellow noble aﬁcionados
mentioned in private gatherings before she was pulled into the gray
fog or made formal contact with Beyonder powers.
None of those rituals had any eﬀects, but they had given Audrey a
basic understanding of the structure of incantations.
Thus, she knew clearly what these three incantations described and
signiﬁed.
The descriptions usually described one of the seven gods that looked
over this world!
Thus, The Fool’s incantation was claiming status equal to the Lady of
Crimson, Mother of the Secrets, and the Empress of Disaster and
Horror!
Is Mr. Fool the unknown, mysterious, powerful, godlike entity that Glaint
spoke of? The source of danger that we must avoid in rituals? Audrey
quickly recalled the comments made during the strange rituals which
she and her friends did not dare attempt back then. She was
momentarily at a loss for words.
Alger Wilson, who knew and understood much more than Audrey,
shivered from the bottom of his heart.
If the ritualistic magic which Mr. Fool designed truly points to him to
allow him to accept our requests, w-we would have to be addressing him
with Him. He is to be addressed in the third person, which is reserved for
gods…
How lucky, how smart I was to act in concert with him and not do
anything foolish. Even when I was testing him, I did not step beyond the
boundaries of normalcy…
Could he perhaps be an ancient, mysterious, horrifying existence, only
that he does not appear before us in his true form and name… The
Primordial Demoness, the Hidden Sage, or the true Creator which many
mysterious churches believe in?
Alger understood that The Fool he was looking at now might not be
his true form. He might not even have a gender or be a humanoid
creature.
Klein propped his forehead up with one hand and tapped on the table
with the other hand. He acutely noticed the changes happening to
The Hanged Man and Justice.
But he acted as though nothing happened, as if everything was within
his expectations. He continued without any care.
“I pray for your help.
“I pray for your loving grace.
“I pray for you to give me a good dream.
“Moon ﬂower, an herb that belongs to the red moon, please bestow
your powers to my incantation!
“Fingered citron, an herb that belongs to the sun, please bestow your
powers to my incantation.”
…
He ﬁnished describing the incantations that belonged to another type
of ritual. After he was done, he smiled.
“Lady, sir, have you memorized it?”
“Ah…” Audrey exhaled. She quickly covered her mouth and recalled
seriously.
With her improved memory as a Spectator, she quickly processed the
information and repeated the incantations as a form of conﬁrmation.
Alger acted more normally. His pen did not stop for a moment, no
matter what he was thinking about.
After Klein conﬁrmed that Audrey was correct, he smiled and said, “If
this test is successful, then we shall modify the ritual next time to
achieve what we want to do.”
“I hope that you will have the time to complete the ritual no later
than Wednesday. ”
He intended to come in here again on Thursday night to ascertain if
the ritualistic magic was successful.
As for why he did not allow The Hanged Man and Justice to directly
request a leave of absence, Klein was worried that he would be
unable to discern if the results were from them asking for leave or
merely the outcome of an attempt of the ritualistic magic. Was he to
pull them into the Gathering if that happened?
“By your will.” Audrey and Alger replied respectfully, collecting
themselves.
“According to The Hanged Man’s suggestion last week, we shall have
a time for casual conversation after all oﬃcial issues have been
discussed. Who shall begin?” Klein gave a hand gesture signaling for
someone to start.
Audrey sighed and said, “Mr. Fool, the suggestion you made
regarding the exam selection and the separation between civil and
political matters has received the approval of many members of
parliament. Perhaps it could become a reality. Of course, with the
eﬃciency of this government, the bill will only appear half a year
from now at the earliest.”
She was not worried that The Hanged Man would track her down
using this piece of information. She had intentionally and
intermittently dropped hints and guided those proud wives to think
that they had conceived the idea. Those ladies had rushed to tell their
husbands, their fathers, and their brothers.
At that moment Audrey felt as though she was watching a ﬂock of
golden peacocks showcasing their tail feathers.
She believed that those women would drill it in themselves that they
came up with the idea to claim the glory for themselves. They would
soon forget about what Audrey’s role in the matter was, ﬁghting
among themselves to see who thought of the suggestion ﬁrst.
Using this remarkable way to change the system of a kingdom gave
Audrey a weird sense of satisfaction, as if she had found a way for a
Spectator to inﬂuence the plot of a play.
“Let’s hope so,” Alger replied sarcastically.
He paused for a few seconds, then glanced at The Fool. He
deliberated before saying, “In recent decades, the amount of activities
of the various secret organizations has seen an upward trend. In fact,
there are even new secret organizations appearing, some of them
having reached scale with a good number of Beyonders.”
Are you trying to ask me for the reason? I have not even gained access to
information about illegal organizations… Klein merely smiled without
commenting on The Hanged Man’s news. He changed the subject and
said vaguely, “An ancient power is about to wake from its slumber.”
For example, the power represented by the Antigonus family diary…
“Is that so…” Alger muttered softly to himself, as though he recalled
something.
Klein swept his gaze toward The Hanged Man, then past Justice and
said with a smile, “If there is nothing else to share, then let’s end
today’s gathering here.”
“By your will.” Audrey and Alger stood up together.
Klein moved his ﬁnger and severed his connection with the dark red
stars. He watched as the two ﬁgures vanished from the magniﬁcent
palace.
He stood up and turned toward his own chair which was also the
back of the Seat of Honor at the bronze table. He looked at its
symbol.
Radiant stars formed a strange symbol. It was not a symbol that ﬁt
anything in Klein’s present understanding of mysticism.
He observed it closely before identifying the “Pupil-less Eye,” a
symbol representing secrecy. He also saw contorted lines that
represented change. Each of the symbols were missing a portion and
were overlapped with each other, creating a new symbol.
An incomplete secret and an incomplete change… What do we get when
we add them together? Klein creased his brows and muttered to
himself, unable to come up with an answer.
He retracted his gaze and walked along the ancient, magniﬁcent
palace. His eyes scanned every corner of the palace.
“Back when I casually imagined this place, it was merely a rough
concept; I did not describe the shape of the palace, table, or chairs…
Where does this design come from? The best choice? The ﬁrst
prototype? Or are they a reﬂection of reality?” Klein suddenly had a
question he neglected previously as he looked at the palace.
Sigh, I have to say that even though I am a keyboard warrior, I am
lacking experience in many areas. I am also not observant enough, to the
point of only realizing this question now… With such a self-reﬂection,
Klein made a serious eﬀort to examine every corner of the palace, but
did not ﬁnd any other living things or anything strange.
Klein did not dare to venture deeper, which seemed to be an illusory
land without boundaries. He was afraid that he would end up
completely lost.
Wow, this place is indeed ﬁlled with mysteries… Who knows if there will
be any changes to this area when I become more powerful… Klein
sighed. He unleashed his spirituality and enveloped himself within,
causing him to feel the rapid rush of plummeting.
Everything ﬂew past quickly. All kinds of illusions shattered. He tore
through the grayish-white fog and saw reality. He saw the table,
curtains, and clothes rack in his room.
…
Backlund, Empress Borough.
Audrey saw the oil painting that hung on the wall. She felt the
softness the down-feathered pillow under her head provided.
She did not stand up immediately; instead, she seriously recalled
what had happened during the gathering, as if she was watching a
play she had already watched.
“Mr. Fool had a certain conﬁdence in his tone when he told us to try
the ritual and gave us the descriptions of the mysterious ruler, the
King of Yellow and Black… Conﬁdence…” Audrey exhaled as she was
analyzing this silently, her body shuddering slightly.
Forget it, since I cannot ﬁght it, there’s no need to think too much about
it… Mr. Fool has always appeared friendly; he should be an entity that
has a respect for order…Audrey’s mood improved rapidly. She thought
about her acting, and the weakening backlash of the potion.
She hummed a merry tune and got oﬀ her bed. She walked toward
the door and adjusted her state of mind, taking on her state as a
Spectator.
As she opened the door of the room, she saw a maid walking past.
She saw the old calluses on her hands, the marks on her face, and
other similar details. She could deduce many things from these
observations.
At this point, Audrey had a strange feeling. She quickly turned to
look at the shaded corner of the balcony.
She saw her golden retriever Susie sitting there, silently observing
her, just like how she observed the maid.
My Goddess… Audrey’s lips twitched as she sighed. She wanted so
much to hide her face.
…
On the Sonia Sea, in the heavily protected captain’s quarters.
Alger woke up and noticed that nothing had changed around him. It
was as if nothing had happened.
He sighed and thought to himself, An ancient existence?
…
Klein, who had exited the ritual, pulled open the curtains. He took
out his notebook and began writing once again.
He recalled the contents of Emperor Roselle’s diary, hoping to
reinforce the memory through writing and prevent himself from
forgetting it in the future.
Klein reread the notes several times after he ﬁnished writing. Finally,
he tore the notes up and incinerated them.
I shouldn’t forget the most salient points if I do this once a week. But with
time and the increasing complexity of my missions… How unfortunate, I
do not have better ideas for the time being. I have not learned any
cryptography… Klein collected himself and stretched his neck. He
planned on heading to the Divination Club.
A Seer was deﬁned diﬀerently by diﬀerent people. No one could say
that another person’s methods were wrong. So, Klein, who did not
know which kind of Seer ﬁt the requirements of the potion, could
only correct it as he experimented to ascertain which one was the
best ﬁt!
Chapter 62: The Seer's
Suggestion
Before Klein left home, he took the time to meticulously clean up his
suit and top hat with a small brush and a handkerchief. Then, he
washed his white shirt, changing into a similar linen shirt along with
the only decent cheap coat he had. He then briskly walked out onto
the street.
First, Melissa’s dress. Then, Benson’s suit. Only then can I consider a
second suit for myself. Money is never enough… Besides, we need to save
money to buy porcelain tableware to receive our guests… Plus, I have to
save money to buy a variety of materials related to mysticism… Klein sat
on the public carriage and took note of the ﬁnancial status at home.
The more he did the math, the more he shook his head.
He reckoned he needed at least a year to let himself, his brother, and
his sister live as a middle-class family.
Of course, that was without taking promotions and pay rises into
consideration.
The public carriage drove past the streets and stopped opposite to the
Divination Club on Howes Street.
Klein pressed down on his black top hat and hopped oﬀ the carriage.
He walked along the familiar street and entered the club located on
the second ﬂoor. He then saw the beautiful brunette, Angelica.
There was a hint of swelled redness to her eyes, but she looked
extremely relaxed.
Klein raised his hand to tap his glabella lightly and carefully
examined her. He found out that the grayness deep in Angelica’s
emotional colors had greatly dispersed. It had been replaced with
sunlight-like whiteness.
After taking it in, Klein walked over, took oﬀ his hat, and smiled.
“Madam Angelica, it’s a lovely day today, isn’t it?”
Angelica lifted her head and was brieﬂy shocked. She then beamed
and said, “You are just like Mr. Vincent’s cat. You don’t make any
sounds while walking, do you? You managed to tell? Hehe, I forgot
that you are a fortune-teller skilled in face-reading…”
She paused, then she gently bit her lip before bowing.
“Thank you. Thank you for your suggestion yesterday. I feel much
better. I haven’t been this relaxed, happy, and contented in a year.”
Upon hearing her show her sincere gratitude, Klein was infected with
the joy and happiness she had. The corner of his lips lifted, and he
said, “It’s my pleasure.”
As he spoke, he could feel his spirituality relax and turn livelier.
Is this what the Seer potion wants? A Seer that can really help the
inquirer? Klein pinched his glabella as though he was thinking before
secretly tapping twice.
It had to be said that he found the action of activating and
deactivating his Spirit Vision in practice insuﬃciently inconspicuous.
However, the problem was that he hadn’t thought of a better solution
yet. As he had just become a Seer recently, his spiritually had yet to
reach its limit, and the same was applied to his mastery. Hence, there
didn’t seem to be many suitable locations for an activation switch for
his Spiritual Vision. The glabella was the best option by far.
When I become a true Seer after fully digesting the potion, I should be able
to design a more inconspicuous activation motion… Klein nodded
unnoticeably and walked towards the half-opened meeting room.
“Coﬀee or tea?” Angelica asked hurriedly.
“Desi coﬀee.” Klein answered. He planned on trying out all the drinks
the Divination Club had to oﬀer.
Then, he saw that there were six or seven members present, but not
Hanass Vincent who was almost always was.
“Mr. Vincent isn’t here?” Klein stopped in his tracks and asked a
passing question.
Angelica was taken aback as she said, “Mr. Vincent doesn’t come
every day. He accepted an invitation to give a lecture for a divination
organization at Enmat Harbor. Are you looking for him?”
“Not at all. I was just curious. After all, I’ve seen him every time I’ve
come here.” Klein shook his head with a smile.
Meanwhile, he realized that there was a familiar face among the
seven members present.
Glacis, who had divined for him before, was present!
Glacis was reading some information on the table with his monocle
when he suddenly sensed someone looking at him. He lifted his and
head cast his gaze.
Obvious joy suﬀused his face as he propped himself up with both
hands and stood up. He dashed towards Klein and stopped before
him.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Moretti. I have been wondering if you would
come today.
“I heard from Angelica that you are not a doctor, but a fortune-teller
who is good at face-reading?”
Klein smiled.
“That’s not the only thing I’m good at. Mr. Glacis. You no longer
seem plagued by your ailment?”
He pinched his forehead and tapped his glabella twice. He noticed
that Glacis’s health colors had returned to normal.
“Yes, I was very regretful for not taking your suggestion back then.
Luckily, there is a very amazing apothecary near my place. He gave
my wife a magical medicine which brought me away from death,”
Glacis said emotionally.
As a quasi-member of the Nighthawks, Klein asked out of
occupational interest, “Very amazing apothecary? Very magical
medicine?”
Magical? How magical? Is it within the range of Beyonders?
“He said that it was a kind of folk medicine from Lenburg. In short, it
helped with treating my illness a lot,” Glacis answered, without
noticing anything abnormal about the question.
Folk medicine apothecary? Klein tapped his glabella as though he was
thinking.
“What’s his name? Where does he stay? As you know, even a fortune-
teller can’t guarantee that they would remain in the pink of health all
the time. Perhaps, I will need to go to purchase some medication
from him in the future.”
Klein learned from his teacher and classmates that the current health
system in the world was in a nascent state. There was almost no cure
to many diseases, so the magical medications and miraculous
apothecaries still controlled the market. There was no harm in
knowing more, since it could one day serve useful.
Glacis answered honestly, “His name is Lawson Darkwade. He has a
tiny store at 18 Vlad Street in East Borough, named Lawson’s Folk
Herb Store.”
“Thank you.” Klein remembered it and spoke sincerely.
Glacis turned around and invited him to sit beside him. At that
moment, Angelica came over to serve the coﬀee she brewed.
Compared to Southville coﬀee, Desi coﬀee is more fragrant, but has quite
an inferior taste… Klein took a sip and savored it for a moment.
Glacis hurriedly deliberated his words when he saw Klein put down
his white porcelain cup.
“Mr. Moretti, can I request a divination from you? I will pay
according to a price you set.”
“Eight pence is suﬃcient. I will not raise the price out of the blue.”
Klein was hoping that someone would request his divination services.
“Do you need a divination room?”
“Alright. Topaz.” Glacis led the way with much more familiarity.
After entering the divination room and locking the door, Klein sat
behind the long table. He asked in a serious voice, “Mr. Glacis, what
would you like the divination to be about?”
“I have an investment opportunity, but the amount of money it
involves is huge. If it fails, my family and I will take a heavy hit. I
wish to know if it will be a successful investment.” Glacis volunteered
the information. “I have divined using tarot cards previously. Hmm, a
divination after purifying my soul. The result was pretty good. Yes, I
did the interpretation myself, but I did not violate the principles of
those symbols.”
Klein thought and asked curiously, “It’d be great if you could describe
the entire situation once more and give me your information again.
It’d be best if you have the other party’s information, too. We will do
an astrolabe divination.”
“Alright.” Glacis organized his words and said, “When Mister Lanevus
examined the Hornacis mountain range, he discovered a gigantic
mine rich in high-quality iron ore. He poured in all his savings to buy
that land and hired a professional company to survey it. The result
was a heartening one.”
“He lacks funds needed for subsequent developments, so he formed a
steelworks company and intends to apply for a loan from the bank
using the project. At the same time, he will also issue a corresponding
number of shares to raise its initial capital. The plan is still in its
preparatory stage and promises fat returns.”
Klein, who had been reading the newspaper recently and also
happened to be a “history expert,” knew that there were shares in
this world. He also knew that the concept of shares was derived from
Emperor Roselle. Yeah, him again.
During the colonization of the Southern Continent, he had set up the
Siberon company and solved the nation’s ﬁduciary matters
successfully by raising funds from the public through the issue of
shares. As such, he had the ﬁrst-movers advantage from colonization.
Because the returns were great, this development continued on. For
example, there were railway shares, mining shares, steam
development shares, and so on and so forth. There were some that
succeeded and there were some that failed. Hence, it catalyzed the
formation of organizations like the Backlund Stock Exchange.
Besides that, the Emperor Roselle had created national bonds, unit
trusts, and other ﬁnancial products. The former had become the most
stable form investment, with a return of four to six percent interest.
Klein remembered that Benson had once said that if he could inherit
three thousand pounds, there was no need to work hard any further.
The stable annual interest of about ﬁve percent would result in an
annual ﬁxed income return of 150 pounds, roughly equivalent to
Klein’s annual income at present.
This is known as rentier capitalism… Klein sighed and asked carefully,
“Are you sure there’s nothing wrong about this? Is Lanevus
trustworthy?”
“I’ve seen his property papers and the inspection report. There is the
Sivellaus county government’s stamp and an endorsement of a
professional company. Plus, inside Mr. Lanevus’s oﬃce is a group
photo of him with Sir Deweyville and the Mayor.” Glacis nodded in
reply.
Group photo? That doesn’t mean anything… Klein, who was born in an
era of information explosion, had seen too many similar incidents. He
didn’t buy the story because of that.
However, it didn’t matter if he believed it or not. He could only pick
up a pen and draw a corresponding astrolabe according to the crucial
time and information that Glacis had provided him with.
After a long while, Klein pointed to the astrolabe and said, “You
should be able to tell that this will be a very unsuccessful endeavor.
Below the ﬂourishing surface is a cliﬀ, a chasm. My divination
suggestions going around it, to avoid it.”
“…” Glacis fell into silence, his mouth turning agape a few times
before he closed it.
A few minutes later, he said with a rueful smile, “I’ll consider it
carefully when I’m back.”
Upon hearing this answer, Klein could only shake his head with a
silent sigh. He realized the helplessness of a Seer.
A Seer could only give suggestions and not make the decision for
others.
Just as the two left the Topaz room, Angelica walked over and said,
“Mr. Moretti, someone wishes for your divination.”
When she said that, she added with a whisper, “He did not ask for my
recommendations. Nor did he view the album.”
Has my reputation spread? Klein turned towards the reception hall in
puzzlement.
Chapter 63: Dream
Interpretation
Klein proceeded a few steps forward and saw the client. He was
dressed in a formal black suit and a halved top hat. He held a gold-
inlaid wooden cane and his short blond hair ﬂared from the sides. His
nose was aquiline like a hawk’s beak.
Anna’s ﬁancé… The Joyce Meyer that went through a terrifying
ordeal. Klein, who had seen him in his dream divination,
immediately greeted with a smile, “Good afternoon, Mister Meyer.”
“Good afternoon, Mr. Moretti.” Joyce took oﬀ his hat and bowed in
greeting. “Thank you for the advice you gave Anna. She cannot stop
praising how miraculous you are.”
Klein chortled and said, “I did not change a thing. You should be
thanking yourself. Without your determination and your hope for a
better tomorrow, you wouldn’t have been able to overcome such an
ordeal.”
After the exchange of pleasantries, Klein could not help but lampoon
inwardly.
Does this count as mutual professional bootlicking?
“In all honesty, I still ﬁnd my coming back alive a dream. I still
cannot believe that I survived wave after wave of terrifying ordeals.”
Joyce shook his head wistfully.
Without waiting for Klein’s reply, he asked curiously, “You knew who
I was the moment you saw me. Was that because of my unique nose,
or because you divined that I would visit you?”
“I had your detailed information. That is enough for a seer,” Klein
answered vaguely, behaving like how a charlatan would.
Joyce was indeed stunned. More than ten seconds later, he squeezed
a smile.
“Mr. Moretti, I wish to request a divination from you.”
The moment he ﬁnished his sentence, he suddenly realized
something.
Mr. Klein Moretti had addressed himself as a seer, not a fortune-
teller. A seer!
“Alright, let us head to Topaz.” Klein gestured.
At that moment, he felt as though he should have worn a long black
robe. He tried to keep his words to a minimum to accentuate the
mystique of a seer.
Joyce Meyer locked the door behind him after entering the divination
room. While he observed his surroundings, Klein seized the
opportunity to tap his glabella twice and activated his Spirit Vision.
Joyce sat down and set his cane down beside him. He pulled on his
black bow tie and said hoarsely, “Mr. Moretti, I wish for you to
interpret my dream.”
“Dream interpretation?” Klein acted as though it was within his
expectations, but was merely asking for conﬁrmation.
He saw that the colors representing Joyce’s health were dull, but
none of them signiﬁed an impending illness. The colors symbolizing
his emotions were predominantly blue, and its darkness showed that
he was obviously high strung.
Joyce nodded seriously.
“I have had the same horriﬁc dream every night ever since the Alfalfa
arrived at Enmat Harbor. I know that this could be associated with
the trauma of the ordeal and that I should go see a psychiatrist, but I
suspect that this is no ordinary dream. A normal dream would
deﬁnitely have some details that are diﬀerent even if they recur every
night, but this dream is, at the very least, constant in the parts which
I can recall.”
“To a seer, these kinds of dreams are seen as revelations given by the
divine,” Klein said, half consoling and half explaining. “Can you
describe the dream to me?”
Joyce clenched his ﬁsts and up to his. He thought deep for a moment
before saying, “I dreamed that I was falling from the Alfalfa into the
ocean. The ocean was dark red, as if it was ﬁlled with rotting blood.
“As I fell, I was grabbed by a person on the boat. I could not identify
him, but I know that he was very strong.
“And I was also holding onto a person in an attempt to save him from
falling into the sea. I know that person. He was a passenger of the
Alfalfa, Younis Kim.
“Because of his weight and his struggling, I could not bear the weight
and could only release my hands and watch him get devoured by the
sea of blood.
“At that moment, the person above me also released his hand. I
ﬂailed my arms, hoping to grab onto something, but there was
nothing. I could only plummet rapidly.
“Then I wake up in horror, sweat covering my back and forehead.”
Klein held his forehead and gently rapped it as though he was
thinking. He then organized his words and said, “Mr. Meyer,
nightmares, similar nightmares, and repeated nightmares, these are
all psychological problems and have a corresponding source. The
same nightmare recurring time and time again is a reminder from
your spirituality. It is also a revelation given to you by the divine.”
Upon seeing Joyce appearing confused, he elaborated, “Do not have
any doubt, an ordinary person’s spirituality is also capable of giving
reminders.”
“I do not know what exactly happened on the Alfalfa, but I can see
that it was a tragedy of blood and steel. It has left a deep trauma in
you.”
Seeing Joyce nod slightly, Klein continued, “You must have been very
horriﬁed, very fearful on the ship. It is easy for a person to lose their
observational skills when overwhelmed by such intense emotions;
thus missing signs that they should not have been missed. This does
not mean that you have not seen those signs, but you have
disregarded them, you understand? Disregarded.
“In your subconscious, in your spirituality, the details that you have
missed are present all the same. If the thing that the detail is pointing
toward is important enough, then your spirituality will remind you in
the form of a dream.”
Previously, I had similar case of disregarding a feeling, only to later
realize that the diary was with Ray Bieber… But I was more sensitive and
had stronger spirituality. I was also more knowledgeable about mysticism
and thus could make a deduction more quickly… Klein paused for a few
seconds and looked into Joyce Meyer’s eyes.
“Did Mister Younis Kim, who you let fall into the sea of blood,
requested you of something on the boat, but was ultimately unable to
escape his fate?”
Joyce ﬁdgeted his body unnaturally. He opened his mouth several
times before answering,
“Yes, but I do not pity him. Perhaps a few days or a week from now,
you will see in the newspapers how cruel and evil he was. He raped
and murdered at least three ladies and tossed a baby into the raging
sea. He also led a bunch of savages who had lost their rationality and
brutally massacred the passengers and crew of the boat.
“He was scheming, strong, and evil. I did not dare, nor could I stop
him. I would only have forfeited my life.”
“I am not doubting what you did,” Klein said, making clear his stand.
Then he explained, “But your dream is telling me that you are feeling
regret and sorry. You believe that you should not have released your
hand back then. Since you believe that killing him was an act of
justice, then why are you feeling regret and sorry for it, so much so
that you have recurring dreams about you releasing your hand?”
“I don’t know either…” Joyce shook his head, confused.
Klein crossed his hands and placed it under his chin. He attempted to
analyze the situation.
“Incorporating what I just described, it seems you have missed
certain details. For instance, anything that Younis Kim mentioned, his
contents of his plea, the way he presented himself, et cetera. I cannot
recall the incident for you, so please think about it carefully.”
“There’s nothing… All he could say back then was ‘spare me, I
surrender’…” Joyce muttered in puzzlement.
Klein did not know exactly what happened, so he could only guide
him based on what he understood from the dream.
“Perhaps you felt that Younis Kim was more useful alive, that he
could prove something or to explain something?”
Joyce knitted his brows. It was a while before he said, “Perhaps… I
still ﬁnd the conﬂict that arose on the Alfalfa happened too suddenly
and turned intense too quickly. It was as if the passive evil in
everyone’s heart just erupted uncontrollably… It was too abnormal,
very abnormal… Perhaps—perhaps I wished to interrogate Younis
Kim why he acted as though he was possessed by the devil in the ﬁrst
place…”
Klein suddenly had a stroke of inspiration after hearing Joyce’s
dreamy description. He spoke mysteriously with a tone unique to
charlatan’s.
“No, that’s not the only reason.”
“What?” Joyce seemed shocked.
Klein crossed his hands and held his chin up. He stared straight into
Joyce’s eyes and said with a slow, yet forceful tone,
“Not only did you ﬁnd the matter abnormal, but you also saw some
things that you disregarded. And putting together these things that
you disregarded results in a terrifying conclusion.
“Your spirituality is telling you that there is someone who should be
under the highest suspicion. And that person is the one who had
grabbed you but ultimately released his hand in the dream. You do
not suspect him subconsciously, and thus you are unable identify
him. He is your partner. He once had control over your fate, or
maybe, even saved you before!”
Joyce leaned back suddenly, slamming into the back of the chair with
a dull thud.
His forehead slowly became laced with sweat, his eyes ﬁlled with
confusion.
“I… I see it…”
Joyce suddenly stood up noisily, causing his chair to wobble and
nearly fall.
“Mr. Tris…” He used all the energy in him to utter the name.
He was a friendly and bashful little boy with a round face. He was the
hero that saved the survivors…
Klein did not interrupt Joyce’s thoughts. He leaned back slightly and
waited.
Joyce’s expression changed several times, ﬁnally returning to normal,
a normal that had a little paleness.
He revealed a rueful smile.
“I understand now. Thank you for interpreting my dream. Perhaps it
is time for me to make a trip to the police station.”
He took out his leather wallet and ﬁshed out a one-soli note.
“I do not think that money can fully represent your worth, and I can
only give you the price you asked for. This is for you.” Joyce pushed
the note toward Klein.
I wouldn’t have minded if you gave me 10 pounds… One soli, you sure
are like your ﬁancée… Klein kept up his mysterious vibe as a charlatan
and said nothing, smiling as he pressed on the note.
Joyce took a deep breath, wore his hat, and turned to walk toward
the door.
As he was unlocking the door, he suddenly turned back and said with
sincerity,
“Thank you, Master Moretti.”
Master? Klein laughed to himself. He watched as Joyce left the
divination room and said silently to himself,
Whatever happened on the Alfalfa seems extraordinary… If only the
Captain was here. He would be able understand everything that happened
in Joyce Mayer’s dreams…
…
Tuesday at dawn. Backlund, Empress Borough.
Audrey, who woke up earlier, beckoned her golden retriever Susie
over. She said with a serious tone, “Susie, you are also a Beyonder
now. We are the same kind, ew—no, what I mean is that we have to
help each other. Guard the door later and don’t let anyone disturb
me. I have to conduct a ritual.”
Susie looked at her mistress and shook her tail in exasperation.
Chapter 64: Instigator
After instructing her golden retriever, Susie, Audrey paced around,
seemingly worried. She too was uncertain if the ritualistic magic
would result in anything odd.
“Let’s do this…” Her eyes turned calm as she used her state as a
bystander to view the imagined process. Soon, she came to a new
arrangement.
Audrey unlocked the door to her bedroom and said to Susie, “Susie,
sit here. If Annie and the rest try to barge their way in, immediately
go to the bathroom to inform me.”
In order to prevent any accidents, her personal maidservant had the
key to unlock her door.
Susie looked at her enigmatically and wagged her tail thrice.
“Very good. I will let you choose anything you want for lunch today!”
Audrey pumped her ﬁst gently.
After exhorting Susie, she entered the bathroom. The square bathtub
was three to four meters on each side. There was clear water rippling
gently in it with steam emitting from it. It was quite a dreamy sight.
Audrey tidied up a rectangular table with many bottles placed on it.
Then, she went back out and moved candles, sacriﬁcial items, and a
white robe over.
Immediately after that, she closed the bathroom door.
With everything done, Audrey heaved a sigh of relief and picked up a
translucent light-blue bottle beside the four candles.
The cylindrical bottle shimmered dreamily under the light. In it was
the essence oils she had distilled from a mixture yesterday. As an
aﬁcionado of mysticism, she had no lack of research regarding such
items. She had many diﬀerent kinds of pure dew, ﬂower essence,
perfume, essential oils, and incense that she brewed herself at home.
As such, she had already ﬁnished the initial preparations according to
The Fool’s instructions.
“Moon ﬂowers, gold mint, slumber ﬂowers, ﬁngered citron, and rock-
rose… What an odd concoction…” Audrey mumbled softly. “Oh, one
has to cleanse one’s body and calm their mind before engaging in
ritualistic magic. This is a form of reverence to the divine—uh, to the
target.”
As she went through the entire process in her head, she placed the
ritual’s essential oil beside her bathtub. She reached out and began
disrobing what she wore at home.
Pieces of her silk clothing fell into the laundry basket one after
another. Audrey coiled up her hair into a bun and tested the water’s
temperature with her hand. Then, she carefully stepped into the
bathtub, allowing her body to slowly sink into the water’s warm
embrace.
“Phew…” She exhaled comfortably, ﬁnding herself warm all over.
She felt abnormally relaxed.
I don’t even want to move a single ﬁnger… Audrey forcefully pumped
herself out as she grabbed the translucent light-blue bottle beside her
and dripped a few drops into the water.
A waft of fragrance dispersed, ﬁlling the silence with a refreshing
smell. Audrey breathed in a few times and nodded in satisfaction.
“Not bad. It smells really good.
“How relaxing. How comfortable…
“I don’t want to move at all. All I wish is to lie here in silence…
“Silence, in silence… si…lence…”
After losing her sense of time, Audrey suddenly heard barking.
She opened her eyes in shock, looking to her sides in a daze. She had
no idea when Susie had opened the door and entered. She was
squatting outside the bathtub, looking at her with an exasperated
look.
As she rubbed the corners of her eyes, Audrey felt that the water had
cooled down quite signiﬁcantly.
I-I fell asleep? She subconsciously asked herself.
Susie looked at her without barking or wagging her tail.
“Haha, the eﬀects of that bottle of ritual essential oil sure is great.
Yeah, really great!” Audrey chuckled dryly as she explained with a
cheerful tone.
She stood up, retrieved a towel, and as she wrapped and wiped her
body, said to the golden retriever beside her, “Susie, continue
keeping watch. Do not let Annie and the rest enter!”
Only when the golden retriever left did she secretly stick out her
tongue. She threw her towel aside and wore a clean white robe.
After closing the door to the bathroom, Audrey recalled the ritual she
had memorized.
She picked up four candles and placed them on the four corners of
the table.
A loaf of white bread at the top left corner, a bowl of Feynapotter noodles
at the top right corner. Smells great, but it’s a little cold… No! It’s not
time to think of this! Paella at the bottom left corner and Desi pie at the
bottom right… Audrey set up the altar according to The Fool’s
descriptions seriously, shaking her head twice during the process.
After she was done with the preparation, she left her four candles lit.
She picked up a silver knife and stabbed it into a pile of coarse salt.
After narrating the sacred incantation in Hermes, Audrey raised the
knife with beautiful patterns and placed it into a cup ﬁlled with clear
water.
After focusing her mind, she pulled out the silver ‘sacred blade,’
cogitating her spirituality to spew out and spread from her blade.
Invisible energy spewed out as Audrey held the knife and circled the
altar once. When she felt that a spirituality wall was fully erected
around her, she expelled all the uncleanliness and distractions
outside.
Maintaining her Spectator state, she prevented her excitement and
joy from aﬀecting the ritual.
She put down the silver knife and picked up the tiny light-blue
crystalline bottle and dripped a drop on each candle.
Sizzle!
A faint fragrance emanated as Audrey’s body, heart, and soul seemed
to attain tranquility.
She drew a breath as she lowered her head in reverence and began
chanting the incantation in Hermes.
“The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era,
“You are the mysterious ruler above the gray fog,
“You are the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck,
“I pray for your help.
“I pray for your loving grace.
“I pray for you to give me a good dream.
“Moon ﬂower, an herb that belongs to the red moon, please bestow
your powers to my incantation!
“Fingered citron, an herb that belongs to the sun, please bestow your
powers to my incantation!”
…
Right after Audrey chanted the incantation and hoped to cogitate the
contents of her plea, she felt there was a stir within the spirituality
wall. She saw a dark red star swirling on the back of her hand.
Her heart leaped as she hurriedly closed her eyes and calmed her
heart to plead sincerely.
When everything was over, she surveyed her surroundings
wondrously, but did not ﬁnd anything odd.
“Is that all?” Audrey knitted her eyebrows slightly as she whispered.
…
The King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck… The Fool that
doesn’t belong to this era… In the Blue Avenger’s captain cabin, Alger
Wilson in his windstorm robe was silently reciting the three lines of
description he had heard in the afternoon. He seemed to be
attempting to ﬁnd clues of the person’s identity through it.
He shook his head and stood up in a clearly vexed manner, but
ultimately did not do anything.
Alger was not at ease inside the Blue Avenger, an ancient ship that
was a relic from the Tudor Dynasty. Although he was already in
control of the ship, he had a gut feeling that there were still many
hidden secrets, just like the Blood Emperor.
Therefore, he planned on using the ship to test The Fool’s powers but
did not wish to attempt the unknown ritualistic magic on the ship.
Alger ruminated for a few minutes before leaving the captain’s cabin
and went on deck. He said to the few sailors, “We will be reaching
the Rorsted Archipelago soon. We will be anchoring there for a day.”
The sailors immediately cheered as they shouted in unison, “Thank
you, Your Grace!”
As the ghost ship did not need sailors, there were very few sailors on
board. There was no need to worry about their supplies, being able to
enjoy fresh food and clean water. However, day after day of voyaging
at sea and the nearly unending vistas exhausted them both physically
and mentally. It felt like they were always repressed and tolerating
something until they lost control.
As for the Rorsted Archipelago, it was a famous colony on the Sonia
Sea. Their business was booming, and they had all kinds of
industries.
“I simply can’t wait!” A crew member gyrated his hips and sniggered
a meaningful laugh that all men would understand.
…
On the public carriage toward Zouteland Street, Klein, who was
reading the newspapers leisurely, suddenly jolted. He seemed to hear
an ethereal voice calling out to him.
Shapeless murmurs resounded in his mind as his forehead throbbed
uncontrollably.
The contents of the calling that could not be heard left as fast as it
came. In just ten seconds, it was gone. Klein pinched his forehead
and resisted the throbbing pain deep in his brain.
Is this the murmurings of unknown existences that Old Neil mentioned? A
result of having enhanced spiritual perception? Thoughts ﬂashed through
Klein’s mind as he suddenly saw four black dots appear on the back
of his right hand. They were like tiny inconspicuous moles.
The four black dots that stemmed from the luck enhancement ritual
quickly sank, dimmed, and vanished.
Klein looked at it in surprise and had an additional guess about what
had just happened.
Justice or The Hanged Man has attempted the ritualistic magic I gave
them?
Was my train of thought right?
Those three descriptions have precisely pointed towards me through the
mysterious space above the gray fog?
But I’m far from powerful enough. I can’t hear the contents of their
requests… I wonder if the information is ‘stored’ above the gray fog…
Yes, I should conﬁrm it by entering tonight.
Klein felt a little perturbed and agitated. He quickly raised his
newspaper and hid his face, preventing anyone from seeing the
changes to his expression.
Soon, he arrived at Zouteland Street and entered the Blackthorn
Security Company.
Before he could greet Rozanne, Klein saw Captain Dunn Smith walk
out. He held a piece of paper with a portrait on it.
“Take a look at this internal warrant of arrest. A very cruel and
vicious Beyonder has entered Tingen.” Dressed in his black
windbreaker, the hatless Dunn swept his gaze over and handed the
piece of paper in passing.
Klein received it and the ﬁrst thing that entered his vision was a
portrait sketch.
The sketch was of boy with a round face. He looked amiable with a
tiny hint of bashfulness and was fairly young, probably about
eighteen or nineteen years old.
“Tris, a suspected Beyonder. The initial estimate is that he’s a
Sequence 8 Instigator and we are not eliminating the possibility that
the Theosophy Order is behind it. The culprit behind the massacre of
the Alfalfa… According to a witness testimony, he came to Tingen
after leaving Enmat Harbor. His current whereabouts are
unknown…”
Tris… Alfalfa… It’s actually a crime committed by a Beyonder? Klein
suddenly recalled the dream interpretation from yesterday afternoon
and Joyce Meyer’s description. He immediately said, “Captain, I
know one of the witnesses. He might very well be an important
witness.”
“I know. Joyce Meyer. My help was requested by the Machinery
Hivemind last night. I saw you in Joyce’s dream. Many details have
led to the conﬁrmation that the Alfalfa tragedy was a result of Tris.”
Dunn’s gray eyes looked unperturbed as he chuckled.
How uninteresting. Captain… thankfully it was my rest day yesterday and
not me acting as Seer during working hours… Klein lampooned. He
barely missed the horror of being caught skiving by his direct
superior.
He asked instead, “Which Sequence pathway is Instigator? What kind
of organization is the Theosophy Order?”
Was instigating others to kill each other the method Tris used to eliminate
the side eﬀects of the potion or was it a requirement needed to advance?
Dunn thought for a few seconds and said, “Coincidentally, it’s about
time for you to learn the relevant information regarding Beyonders
and the mysterious organizations. You shouldn’t be ordered by Old
Neil to keep reading the historical documents all the time.”
Captain, wasn’t the reason for recruiting me to be your ‘history expert?’
Klein did not dare point out the problem as he nodded seriously.
“Alright.”
Chapter 65: Beyonder
Information
With a document signed by Dunn, Klein went underground and
turned into the armory.
“Dunn is right. It’s time you understand the diﬀerent Beyonders and
the various secret organizations.” Dressed in a black classic robe, Old
Neil read the note without ﬁnding it surprising. Instead, he supported
the captain’s decision.
He then added immediately with a smile, “After all, you will be
heading to the underground market with me tomorrow night.”
“Tomorrow night?” Klein did not conceal his pleasant surprise as he
asked to conﬁrm.
Old Neil nodded and said with a sigh, “I’m a person who can’t sleep
when in debt. I always wish to settle them as soon as I can.”
You did not seem to act so previously. You left it to the last moment
before using ritualistic magic to resolve the problem… So, I’m not the only
one suﬀering from procrastination… Wait, is there a need to euphemize
‘afraid to spend away the money to repay a loan?’ Klein did not expose
Old Neil and instead urged, “Mr. Neil, I’ll be troubling you to retrieve
the corresponding information from Chanis Gate.”
There were mostly archaeological and historical documents in the
armory. There were documents involving Beyonders and mysterious
organizations, but few in number. Furthermore, they were mostly
basic knowledge.
Old Neil slowly took a sip from his hand-ground coﬀee and smacked
his lips. He then walked out the armory with the signed and stamped
document. Klein watched the place on his behalf.
About ten minutes later, Old Neil returned with a huge stack of
documents.
“They can only be read in here. They are not to be taken out,” he
warned as he placed the information on the desk.
“Alright.” Klein gave a ﬁrm nod. He extended his hands and quickly
ﬂipped through the pages and did a general read through.
Very detailed… As expected of the Nighthawks’s internal documents… As
expected of a Church with four thousand years history or even more…
Klein sighed inwardly as he glanced through the documents.
Not only did the documents introduce the various secret
organizations, it also listed down many of the Sequence pathways. It
was very complete. Some of them only wrote the potion name of the
corresponding Sequence while others only described the Beyonder
abilities of the corresponding Sequence. Some were completely
missing and left blank.
While holding back his excitement, Klein found the Sequence
pathway that led from Seer.
He ruﬄed through the pages and soon found a familiar word.
Then, his delighted expression quickly froze because there was no
corresponding potion name—Sequences 7 and 8—after Seer!
Thankfully, the abilities of the two following Sequences are present…
Klein silently exhaled as he calmed his mind and read the description
seriously.
“Sequence 8: Potion name unknown. The corresponding Beyonder is
good at ﬁghting with artiﬁce and very crafty.”
Good at ﬁghting with artiﬁce? This is the next advancement of Seer? Why
does it feel odd… I’m not a hunter… Am I going to become a melee mage?
What does crafty mean? My intelligence is enhanced, making me good at
fooling the enemy? Klein was stunned. He even suspected that the
Nighthawks’s information was wrong.
There were corresponding case studies appended, but he could not
ﬁnd a reasonable explanation despite reading it repeatedly.
He cast his gaze lower as the description of Sequence 7 entered his
eyes.
“Potion name unknown. The corresponding Beyonder is good at
many spells that can be quickly cast. Fuses one’s body’s skill and
supernatural powers as one.
That’s more like it! This is what an advancement of a Seer should
sound like! Klein heaved a sigh of relief.
After seeing the case studies of Sequence 7, he cast his eyes to the
overall description of the pathway.
“This Sequence pathway was ﬁrst established by the Solomon
Empire’s Zaratul family. During the conﬂicts of the Fourth Epoch, the
family was not fully destroyed. The family’s name was occasionally
heard in the history of the Fifth Epoch… It is suspected to be
connected to the ancient organization, the Secret Order.”
Zaratul? Upon seeing this name, Klein’s eyes constricted.
He had just seen this name appear in the remnant diary pages of
Emperor Roselle yesterday afternoon!
Roselle’s acting came from a reminder by the mysterious ﬁgure
known as Zaratul!
Because of that mysterious Zaratul, Emperor Roselle regretted not
choosing Seer? Therefore, I was indirectly inﬂuenced, turning me into a
Seer. It makes acting return to the embrace of the Seer… It feels like it
was all predestined. Klein knitted his brows and felt that things were
somewhat diﬀerent.
Just from the logical chain, he did not feel that there was anything
wrong in any aspect. However, in the domain of mysticism, pre-
destiny often manifested things and involved new problems.
In addition, transmigration is quite a baﬄing matter… It’s just
confusing… And the guy I’ve possessed tried to commit suicide because of
the lost notebook of the Secret Order… Klein thought for quite a while
and had many guesses, but lacked the information needed to prove
them.
Phew… After repeatedly reading the information, he ﬁnally
suppressed his ideas and read the other records.
He ﬁrst found the Sailor Sequence and discovered that it indeed
belonged to the Lord of Storms.
For an old opponent that they haven’t faced for perhaps more than
two to three thousand years, the Nighthawks’s internal records were
rather detailed.
“Sequence 8: Folk of Rage. Ancient name—Guardian of the
Windstorm. The corresponding Beyonder can release several strikes
that exceed ordinary thresholds when enraged. Their strength and
speed are greatly enhanced… Facing them is like facing a storm…
“Sequence 7: Seafarer. Ancient name—Windstorm Priest. The
corresponding Beyonder is also a scholar of astronomy and
geography. They have an intuitive grasp of magnetic ﬁelds, ocean
currents, wind direction, and clouds… A boat with a Seafarer will
never get lost at sea… They are even more beloved by the oceans and
gain enhancements in every aspect at sea…
“They are friends of water. They can act freely underwater for more
than half an hour… They can cast a limited number of water-related
spells. Some are a result of their own capabilities and some are a
bestowment from the Lord of Storms, for example…”
A Sequence 7 Seafarer is very powerful… Klein nodded while in deep
thought.
He suspected that The Hanged Man was a Guardian of the
Windstorm, if not a Seafarer. From how he has recently advanced, it
was more likely he was the latter.
This also indicated in a way that The Hanged Man was either a
member of the Mandated Punisher or a pirate who had been secretly
absorbed by the Church of the Lord of Storms.
Impressive. Impressive… Klein ﬂipped back a few pages and found the
advancement of Spectator. He discovered that the description was
identical to what The Hanged Man had said.
Sequence 9 Spectator was like a Seer. They lacked direct combat
means and could only observe a target to obtain information,
gleaning the true thoughts of the target. By doing so, they could
provide subtle inﬂuences and guidance to cause situations to develop
in a way they wish.
Sequence 8 Telepathic was the advancement of Spectator. Their
observation was not only limited to superﬁcial details, but deeper
into one’s aura, Ether Body, or other mysterious domains. The
combination of the two allowed a Telepathic to precisely understand
a person’s thoughts as though they could read their minds. In front of
them, it was diﬃcult to have any secrets.
Sequence 7’s Psychiatrist, which was also known as Psyche Analyst,
had further enhancements above the Sequence 8 foundations. They
could begin directly inﬂuencing a target. For instance, they could
treat a target’s maniacal problems or alternatively, cause them to
turn maniacal and lose their reason.
“A Beyonder that is very diﬃcult to be noticed…” After reading the
description, Klein made a reasoned judgment.
After understanding the relevant information concerning the
Gathering members, he ﬂipped to the Church of the God of Steam
and Machinery. This was because Emperor Roselle had chosen their
Savant Sequence.
“Sequence 9: Savant. The corresponding Beyonder believes that
knowledge is power. They have a rough understanding of the
supernatural, but are more knowledgeable about aqua regia,
nitroglycerin, and complicated bolts and gears. They seem to know
everything.”
It is no wonder that the Emperor Roselle said that this potion suited him
perfectly, allowing for him to press his advantage to the fullest… Klein
understood completely as he shifted his eyes down.
After several case studies, the corresponding Sequence 8 ﬁnally
appeared in Klein’s vision.
“Archaeologist. They possess a good deal of knowledge about history
and outdoor survival, as well as forbidden knowledge about ruins.
They have a strong enough body and ability to face everything…”
“Sequence 7: Appraiser. They can intuitively understand the powers
and problems of most extraordinary items, and can use them while
keeping danger at its lowest…”
As Klein’s security clearance was insuﬃcient, he only had access to
Sequence pathways up to 7. It left him a little frustrated, but there
was no other way around it. He only wished that Backlund would
quickly send over the Sealed Artifact 2-049 to determine if Ray
Bieber was a descendant of the Antigonus family.
That way, he would have a chance of becoming a formal member and
obtain a higher security clearance.
Collecting himself, Klein read the material seriously from cover to
cover. He knew that the sequences following Corpse Collector were
Gravedigger and Spirit Medium. He also knew that there was no
information about the Sequence 8 of the Mystery Pryer path. Not
only was there no name for the potion, but even the description had
been left blank. There was a name for Sequence 7 of that path:
Warlock!
Sounds impressive… Klein slowly ﬂipped the page and saw Apprentice
and Marauder which Emperor Roselle had lingering thoughts for.
Their records only reached Sequence 8 and nothing more.
“Sequence 9: Apprentice. Their abilities are rather strange. It can
only be conﬁrmed that this is the originating pathway of a mage.
They are rarely trapped and very diﬃcult to be stopped. They often
are able to escape and pass through obstacles every time…
“Sequence 8: Trickmaster. They wield all kinds of strange but
impotent spells…”
“Sequence 9: Marauder. Diﬃcult to separate these Beyonders from
ordinary bandits or thieves. Perhaps the means available to them are
more impressive, but their goal of stealing riches is not for enjoyment
or survival. It’s more like answering a calling…”
“Sequence 8: Sequencers. We have also discovered traces of
Beyonders in fraud investigations. They gain enjoyment from
swindling…”
Gain enjoyment from swindling… This is ‘acting’ in a diﬀerent form, isn’t
it? If I had the choice, I might have chosen Apprentice… Klein silently
said to himself. Suddenly, he discovered the corresponding Sequence
potion of the culprit of the Alfalfa tragedy, Tris—Instigator.
Chapter 66: Demoness Sect
“Sequence 8: Instigator. They are adept at triggering the evil desires
deep in people’s hearts, causing contradictions and inciting conﬂict,
thus resulting in bloody massacres…”
The description isn’t detailed enough. From the looks of it, the Nighthawks
do not understand the capabilities of this potion well enough… But it does
match the characteristics of the Alfalfa tragedy… Klein cast his gaze up
and read the corresponding Sequence 9 for Instigator.
“Sequence 9: Assassin. Can transform their bodies in a short period of
time and become light as a feather. They can also utilize vision equal
to that of an eagle. Every Assassin is adept at hiding in the shadows.
They have dexterous steps and have the ability to release all their
strength in one blow…”
After reading the description, Klein was left completely confused.
Assassin… The advancement from Assassin is Instigator?
This advancement is just as odd as how a Seer advances to a class that is
good at ﬁghting with artiﬁce…
Some Sequence pathways advance in a very ordinary fashion, such as
Spectator. Yet, there are Sequence pathways that seem to violate intuition
and logic?
Well, that might not be completely true. Perhaps I just haven’t discovered
some of the hidden common points…
For instance, Assassins and Instigators can both bring catastrophe to
others…
But I can’t ﬁgure out the advancement of Seer! Hey! Could it be of the
Gandalf 1lineage? After adding some supportive magic, the other attribute
points are dumped into strength and techniques?
As Klein lampooned in a speechless manner, he silently shook his
head. He ﬂipped to the section about the secret organization, the
Theosophy Order that involved Instigators.
“Theosophy Order. A secret organization that appeared in the Fifth
Epoch, which is the early era of the current epoch. They believe that
the mind is fundamental to a person, while the physical ﬂesh is a
cage that restrains the mind. The reason why humans do evil is a
result of the physical body’s inﬂuence. One has to use their
spirituality to obtain knowledge, allowing the mind to gradually
extricate from the body. Then, through the trials of the stars, they
will eventually be separated from the material world, returning to the
purest and truest self, obtaining eternal redemption.”
“Therefore, many extremist members of the Theosophy Order will
make destroying the bodies of others their goal, which has led to
many bloody massacres… It is obvious that they possess two
Sequence pathways. The ﬁrst is the more common Apprentice and
Trickmaster potions among their members. The other Sequence
comprised of Assassin and Instigator rarely appear… There is
currently no evidence that indicates that the Theosophy Order
possesses Sequence 7 or higher potions.
“It is unknown how the Theosophy Order established itself. Their
possible origins can only be analyzed using the two Sequence
pathways. Firstly, the Apprentice and Trickmaster Sequences easily
remind people of the Abraham family of the Trickmaster Dynasty in
the Fourth Epoch. The Tamara family, tied to the Abraham family
through marriage for extended periods of time, cannot be eliminated
as well. Secondly, Assassin and Instigator point towards the
Demoness Sect.”
The Abraham, Tamara, Antigonus and Zaratul families, the Solomon
Empire’s Dark Emperor, the Tudor Dynasty’s Blood Emperor, the
Trunsoest Empire, and the Jacob and Amon families that the Hanged Man
had mentioned… There are really lots of secrets buried in the history of
the Fourth Epoch. There might be a lot of facts too…Klein was
astounded from what he read. He had a deep appreciation for how
the history of the Fourth Epoch was clouded in fog.
The outline he could see through the fog left him shuddering
involuntarily. It was as though he could imagine a thriving era of
Beyonders, an Epoch with blood and strangeness in a concerted
dance or horror and distortion in a symphony.
Klein drew in a silent gasp and ﬂipped through the book, but did not
discover any corresponding descriptions of the Demoness Sect.
He looked up and saw Old Neil wrestling with some ﬁlter paper with
his hand-ground coﬀee. He asked sincerely, “Mr. Neil, what
organization is the Demoness Sect? I can’t ﬁnd any introduction
about them in the documents.”
Old Neil was in no hurry to respond. After wrestling with his coﬀee,
he chuckled and said, “Your security clearance isn’t high enough.
Even with Dunn’s permission, you would not be able to read the
relevant information. It can also be said that a lot of the information
is only available in the Holy Cathedral and isn’t stored behind Tingen
City’s Chanis Gate. Perhaps wait till the day you become a captain of
the Nighthawks. You would be sent to the Holy Cathedral for training
and would then be able to access them.
“I do not understand much about the Demoness Sect. All I know is
that they worship the Primordial Demoness. They believe that this
secret existence is the true inheritor of the Creator. She was born out
of the Chaos and was the earliest to be born from the Creator’s body.
She is also the ultimate Ender that ends everything.
“Their Sequence pathways are related to this because to obtain the
favor of the Primordial Demoness and to approach this secret
existence, the upper echelons are all female. This is also why they are
called the Demoness Sect.
“Anything else is not something a formal member like me will know.
I’ve heard that the demonesses make it their mission to spread
catastrophes.”
Spread catastrophes… This does match the hidden commonality of
Assassin and Instigator… But this Mr. Tris’s future seems bleak. The
subsequent potions seem to be more suited for females… Klein’s nodded
slightly before he continued reading the information.
After he ﬁnished reading, he realized that the secret organizations
were a lot more than he imagined. But on second thought, he found it
very ordinary. After all, this world had so many years of history
underlying it. There was once an era when Beyonder powers were
extremely active.
According to the provided information, Klein categorized the secret
organizations into three based on era.
First were the ancient organizations born in the Fourth Epoch. They
included but were not limited to the Moses Ascetic Order, Secret
Order, and the Blood Sanctify Sect which were followers of the Devil.
However, the information only mentioned the Demoness Sect.
The second was the secret organizations early in the Fifth Epoch, the
present Epoch. For instance, the Theosophy Order or the Death-
worshiping Numinous Episcopate. There is also the Life School of
Thought which employs a master-disciple heritage and the Rose
School of Thought known among Beyonders for its bloody sacriﬁces.
The third category were new organizations that appeared in the
recent century or two. They include the Aurora Order, the Iron and
Blood Cross Order, the Element Dawn, and the Psychology
Alchemists, which Klein learned about much earlier.
Apart from them, there were other organizations that did not do
anything major.
“Benson and Melissa must have never imagined that the world is so
dangerous… it’s not only limited to wars…” Klein shook his head
with a wry smile. He stacked the classiﬁed documents neatly before
pushing it to Old Neil.
Meanwhile, he added silently in his heart.
Please don’t let my Tarot Club be on the list…
Old Neil never suspected that a leader of a secret organization was
sitting opposite to him. He chuckled and took the documents and
headed to Chanis Gate.
Klein sat there and wondered if he should divine the location of
Instigator Tris. But he abandoned the thought after less than twenty
seconds. After all, he only had a vague idea of Tris’s appearance and
did not know if the name was genuine. If he could ﬁgure out his
location with that, he would not be a Seer, but a Prophet!
By the time Old Neil returned, Klein had straightened his thought
processes and continued his revision of mysticism studies to grasp
even more forms of ritualistic magic.
He spent the day studying and revising. He did not participate in the
joint operation needed for capturing Instigator Tris. He did hear that
the delivery of Sealed Artifact 2-049 from Backlund had been delayed
due to some reason or another. The actual time of arrival was still
pending.
As he had earned nearly two soli from yesterday’s divination, Klein
spent ten pence to buy a two-liter barrel of Enmat Beer for Benson on
the way home. He also bought some lemon cakes fresh out of the
oven for Melissa.
“Klein, I know you care for us deeply, but there’s no need. There’s no
need to keep spending money on such matters,” said Benson after he
saw the tiny barrel of beer and deliberating over his words.
Melissa stood beside him and nodded slightly.
This is probably how our consumerist habits diﬀer… Klein sighed in
amusement.
“Benson, Melissa, don’t worry. This was bought with my additional
reimbursement. Yeah, I earn an additional two to four soli every
week.”
I can’t tell them that these are the earnings I got from doing divinations for
others, right… He added inwardly.
“…That job of yours is much better than I imagined.” Benson was
taken aback as he made an objective assessment.
That’s right. I even learned divination from it… Klein mused silently
before turning toward the kitchen.
Under the combined eﬀorts of the trio of siblings, a sumptuous dinner
was ready for eating.
After having their ﬁll, Klein, Benson, and Melissa lay slumped in the
living hall. It took them quite a while before they got up to clean up,
chat, and study.
When Benson and Melissa fall asleep, I’ll head above the gray fog to see
the eﬀects of the ritual… As Klein revised his history textbooks, he
shot a glance at his siblings.
…
West Borough. Iron Cross Street Lower Street.
A three-storied apartment was immersed in darkness. There were no
street lamps or any additional light.
Suddenly, a ﬁgure leaped out of a window from the third ﬂoor. It
landed gently on the ground like a feather without causing so much
as a stir.
His body crouched and suddenly vanished as though he had blended
into the shadows. All that could be seen was the outline of his body.
As he traveled quickly, the ﬁgure arrived at the harbor. He headed
for a corner devoid of anything except for a pile of goods.
He seriously observed for a moment, circling the area twice before
the leaving the darkness and entering the corner.
One could see his round and amiable face. He was Instigator Tris,
who had single handedly caused the tragedy of the Alfalfa.
“How does it feel?” A mysterious ﬁgure wearing a black hooded robe
walked out of the shadows. The hoarse voice obviously belonged to a
woman.
Tris revealed a friendly and satisﬁed smile.
“Feels great. It was a scene I dreamed and yearned for.
“I think I have appropriately completed the mission and have taken
the necessary preparations for the advancement.”
The black-robed woman nodded indiscernibly and said, “Very well.
According to the promise, I’ll hand you the Sequence 7 formula and
the three main ingredients. You will have to gather the rest by
yourself.”
“No problem.” Tris answered, seemingly prepared.
The mysterious woman raised her hand and handed a book-like
object to Tris.
The “book” had an ancient and mottled bronze exterior cover with a
strange star-shaped lock on its side.
Tris knew that inside the “book” was the formula and ingredients. He
instantly became thrilled.
He tried hard to compose himself as he looked curiously at the
potion’s name on the bronze outer cover.
“Witch!”
Tris exclaimed. He found it unbelievable that the word written in
ancient Hermes was “Witch.”
Witch? I’ll advance to become a Witch? What a joke!
The mysterious woman covered her mouth and let out a chortle. It
took her quite some time before she answered, “Weren’t you always
curious? Curious about why our upper echelons are all female…
“That is the answer.”
Chapter 67: Response
The crimson moon high in the sky hung silently in the darkness. It
illuminated Tingen City, the city of universities, as it gradually fell
silent.
Klein stood in front of his desk and looked through his oriel windows
to see the empty Daﬀodil Street. He heard the sound of carriages
quickly galloping far away without causing a din.
He picked up his vine-leaf patterned silver pocket watch and snapped
it open. He took a glance at it and drew the curtains, making the
yellowish lights of the gas lamp reﬂect back into the bedroom.
Klein turned around at an adequate speed, locked his room, and
switched oﬀ the gas valve.
The room was immediately covered in darkness. Only a sliver of red
moonlight penetrated the curtains. It gave rise to an atmosphere
perfect for many late-night folk tales.
Klein took out the silver knife he had applied for. He imagined the
spherical light and entered a half-Cogitation state.
He focused his mind according to his previous practice, allowing his
spirituality to spew out from the tip of his blade. Then, he allowed
their motion to miraculously fuse with his surroundings, sealing oﬀ
the room.
He was doing it to prevent any abnormal stirrings that could wake
Benson and Melissa.
Following that, Klein put down the knife and walked four steps in a
counterclockwise manner. Every step was accompanied by the
incantation from Earth.
The unchanging roars and murmurs inundated him. With the same
mania and pain inﬂicted on him, he did his best to control himself
and withstood the most grueling and dangerous stage in his half-
conscious state.
The grayish-white fog was endless. The dark red stars were at varying
distances from him. The towering divine palace stood erect like a
dead giant. Nothing seemed to have changed. The silence and
antiquity that had accumulated over thousands of years swarmed
him.
No, there is a change! Klein silently muttered to himself. His gaze
locked onto a dark red star near him.
That was the star symbolizing Justice!
The star’s deep redness began to pulse. It did so with average
amplitude, but did not stop.
Klein carefully spread out his spirituality towards the deep redness.
The moment the two made contact, he felt a hum in his head. He saw
a blurry and distorted scene and heard the illusory but stacked voice
of prayers.
“The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era;
“You are the mysterious ruler above the gray fog;
“You are the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck;
“I pray for your help.
“I pray for your loving grace.
“I pray for you to give me a good dream.
…
“I pray for you to give me a good dream.
…
“I pray for you to give me a good dream.”
…
The female voice resounded constantly in an intermittent fashion.
Klein’s psyche turned more irritable and chaotic. It was akin to
listening to someone upstairs pounding on the ﬂoor when he had just
fallen asleep.
He repressed his emotions and used Cogitation to calm the urge. He
carefully discerned the blurry scene that appeared before him.
It was a girl dressed in white robes. She had a head of beautiful
golden hair. She was standing before four ﬂickering ﬂames, her head
lowered as she kept chanting.
From the distorted image, Klein barely recognized her to be Miss
Justice!
At this point, he conﬁrmed that the ritual incantation he had created
could precisely point towards the gray fog, towards him!
This gave him a huge sense of achievement, going from nothing to
having something.
I won’t praise myself for being awesome… Klein’s mood turned for the
better. He felt that the pleading voice that echoed in his ears like a
buzzing ﬂy was now acceptable.
With a thought, he attempted to create a response in his mind,
transferring it through the intricate connection to the dark red star.
“I’m aware.”
…
The gray layer emanated before him. A distorted and blurry ﬁgure
stood in the deepest depths.
The spot where his eyes ought to be swirled with deep redness as his
voice resounded repeatedly in the vast and empty world.
“I’m aware.”
“I’m aware.”
“I’m aware.”
…
Audrey Hall was jolted awake suddenly. She sat up with her blanket
wrapped around her as her mind was fully occupied with the scenes
she saw in her dream.
She knew very well that she had dreamed of the Fool, the mysterious
being that lived above the fog!
“Is this a response to my morning prayers?” Audrey, who quickly
entered her Spectator state, calmed down and analyzed.
Although she did not understand why The Fool did not respond on
the spot and only did so at night, she was still shocked that the
ritualistic magic was eﬀective with the few lines of incantation.
In the past, she had prayed to the Evernight Goddess, but had never
received any response!
Even if Mr. Fool was not a god, he is likely not far from being one…
Audrey slowly inhaled before slowly exhaling.
Since he was a powerful existence that she had no means of resisting,
she quickly threw aside her worries. She began considering what to
do next.
“First, I have to completely digest the Spectator potion… My acting is
still pretty good.
“Second, I have to seek out the Psychology Alchemists.
“Third, I should try to obtain the Telepathist potion formula from Mr.
Fool or clues regarding the Psychology Alchemists elsewhere.
“However, every godlike existence should have a complete Sequence
pathway that belongs to them. They might not know the formulas of
other Sequence pathways… A new Beyonder organization like the
Psychology Alchemists might not be able to garner Mr. Fool’s
attention…”
…
With the connection severed, Klein sat at the bronze table’s seat of
honor in a rather good mood.
He was completely covered in gray fog. He leaned back and clenched
his ﬁst to cover his mouth. He recalled and analyzed the process.
At that moment, he was the only living being in the world of the gray
fog. Apart from that, there was absolute silence.
It seems I can only pass information over and am unable to use the powers
in here… From the looks of it, my idea of manipulation would not work.
Klein kept prodding his mouth as he silently made a conclusion.
He had originally planned on attempting to bind his body with the
world of the gray fog in the same manner if the incantation and ritual
proved eﬀective. As such, he could then leverage all the power of this
mysterious space.
If that happened, he could pray to himself, and through such a
manipulative manner, he could go around the limitations, the
mysteries, and the danger, allowing him to fully use the gray fog
world.
For example, he could ﬁrst conduct a ritual and pray to “himself” for
spells. Following that, he could come above the gray fog and answer
his own request and bestow it.
From the looks of it, I was being too idealistic… My understanding and
control of the gray fog world has not reached that level… Klein shook his
head in a self-deprecating manner and planned on leaving.
At that moment, he saw the dark red star that represented the
Hanged Man begin to pulse. He heard an ethereal and formless voice
spread out.
“I coincidentally chanced upon The Hanged Man’s ritual?” Klein
nodded in thought.
He sat at the seat of honor of the long bronze table and extended his
hand to tap on the star.
His spirituality spread as it touched the pulsing deep redness.
He heard The Hanged Man’s heavy and repeated prayers along with a
blurry scene.
The Hanged Man was draped in a pure-black robe in the scene. He
stood in front of four plumes of ﬁre. The surrounding spirituality had
formed a wall, isolating him from any external inﬂuence.
Klein did not immediately respond. All he did was watch and listen
silently.
“…You are the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck;
“I pray for your help.”
…
After The Hanged Man ﬁnished his prayer, he waited for a while.
Seeing that there was no response, he began dismantling the
spirituality wall, extinguished the candles, and tidied up the altar.
Finally, he swiped his extended hand as aqueous light spread out,
making the altar table look brand new.
Water-based spell… The bestowment of the Storm… The Hanged Man is
indeed at least a Seafarer… Klein nodded slightly. Before the scene
vanished, he responded via the method he imagined, transmitting it
through the blob of dark redness.
…
Alger Wilson was situated in the Rorsted Archipelago’s City of
Generosity.
He had not gone with the sailors to the famous Red Cabaret. Instead,
he stayed inside the hotel and sealed the door and windows shut to
attempt the ritual The Fool had described.
After familiarly ﬁnishing the prayer, Alger waited patiently for a
moment, but did not receive any response.
“It seems this attempt isn’t too successful… Mr. Fool needs to change
methods…” He was both overjoyed, but also a little disappointed.
After everything was done, Alger planned on going downstairs for a
bottle of Langsky Proof—alcohol that could aid a Folk of Rage to
unleash his powers. Mandated Punishers of the Lord of Storms were
rather fond of this sort of beverage.
Pulling open the door, Alger was about to walk out when his vision
blurred. He saw gray fog billow in the corridor and a hazy human
ﬁgure sitting in the deepest depths of the fog, as if on a high throne.
“I’m aware.” The familiar deep voice reverberated around Alger’s
ears, causing him to freeze where he stood as his head slightly
throbbed in pain.
Alger’s eyes suddenly turned dark. He looked around but realized
that nothing had changed. There was still the same squeaky
ﬂoorboard, the same aged wall candle stands, and the same unclean
corridor.
I’m aware… The voice was still resounding by Alger’s ears.
His expression sank as he hit his chest lightly with his ﬁst but did not
say any words of respect to the Lord of Storms.
After a long silence, Alger’s expression was restored to normal, but
his gaze seemed deeper.
…
Klein did not spend too much time above the gray fog. When all the
remnant voices returned to normal, he enveloped himself in his
spirituality and plunged into the gray fog, plummeting into the
material world.
The lights before him ﬂew by rapidly, like the scenes of a movie
played back at a speed tens of times faster than normal. After Klein
felt faint, he saw curtains that let crimson moonlight through along
with the blurry outlines of the desk and bookshelf.
He picked up the silver knife again and removed the spirituality wall
in the room. Then, a sudden gust of wind opened the door and went
through the corridor.
He was completely relieved when he saw that there were no stirrings
from Benson’s or Melissa’s room.
This luck enhancement ritual is really indispensable for traveling… It’s
concealed and mystical… Klein silently murmured and closed the door
again, walking towards his bed.
His mission tomorrow was to head to the underground markets for
Beyonder items with Old Neil.
Chapter 68: Monster
At dusk, the setting sun cast long shadows of the carriages and
horses.
Having informed Benson and Melissa that he was having dinner at
the Blackthorn Security Company, Klein headed to the harbor with
Old Neil on a public carriage.
He was dressed in cheap formal attire, afraid that conﬂict might
break out in such a complicated location—if he damaged his tuxedo
which he took painstaking care of, he would probably cry his heart
out.
When the sunlight appeared to turn ﬁery, the carriage stopped. Old
Neil, in his usual classic black robe and felt black hat with a rounded
edge, ignored the gazes of others and walked diagonally to the Evil
Dragon Bar in ahead of them.
Even though the bar was slightly far away and the heavy doors were
tightly shut, Klein still heard wave after wave of rapturous shouts.
They appeared to be cheering on a hero.
When he came close, he suddenly sensed something. He turned his
head towards the warehouse opposite to the bar. He saw a stocky
man dressed in a uniform standing at a hidden corner on the rooftop.
The man carried a huge grayish-white mechanical box and held a
thick riﬂe in his hand.
The grayish-white mechanical box was obviously connected to the
same-colored riﬂe via piping.
“Steam-pressured riﬂe?” Klein muttered in shock. He looked at Old
Neil and said, “This bar can actually obtain such weapons?”
That was a military-controlled item!
Although it used extracted phlogiston 1 , the size and weight of the
steam backpack were still shocking, something only a true warrior of
blood and iron could withstand. The riﬂe had an extremely high
muzzle velocity and shocking destructive power too.
Matched with a suitable scope, it was nearly equivalent to an inferior
sniper riﬂe.
“What?” Old Neil squinted his eyes as he looked over, having a
confused look too. “Did something happen here?”
Something happened? Klein surveyed his surroundings and discovered
a few more men holding repeating riﬂes who were searching for
something.
“What happened?” Old Neil approached the bar and asked the
brawny man guarding its door outside.
The brawny man obviously knew Old Neil and smiled wryly.
“The bar was nearly destroyed earlier.
“Apparently a wanted man was here trying to buy materials and was
recognized. And this was what resulted from it. Oh Lord, what did he
do, and how dangerous was he to receive such treatment? My legs
went limp seeing all those ﬁrearms, limper than after spending an
entire night with Ginger Sunny!”
He did not know the identity of the wanted man, much less know
that the people who came to buy materials had Beyonders mixed in.
“Wanted man? Do you know his name?” Old Neil asked in interest.
“I think it was Tris or something?” the brawny man answered
uncertainly.
Instigator Tris? Klein nodded in enlightenment, having understood
what was happening.
Tris did not know that Joyce Meyer had cast his suspicion on him;
therefore, he had sauntered right into the market to purchase
materials without heed. He was likely recognized by an informant of
either the Machinery Hivemind or the Nighthawks, resulting in an
intense clash.
“Was he caught?” Klein tapped his silver-inlaid black cane.
Based on the surrounding situation, likely not…
The brawny man shook his head slightly and gestured with his chin
to the rooftop of the warehouse opposite him.
“He rushed out before those terrifying guys arrived. Bloody hell, I’ve
never seen a man run faster than he did!”
You haven’t seen the true skills of an Assassin, or you might be taken
away to some indescribable place for further reeducation… Klein
thought.
“Is the market still open?” Old Neil changed subjects and asked.
“It just restored operations,” replied the brawny man aﬃrmatively.
“That’s great.” Old Neil quickened his pace and extended his right
hand, pushing open the heavy door.
Klein followed closely in tow and walked in. He nearly fainted at the
stuﬃness and smell of alcohol that inundated him.
In the middle of Evil Dragon Bar was a boxing ring. Two half-naked
men were in an intense brawl and surrounding them were dozens of
customers shouting and cheering on the side they supported with no
lack of vulgarities.
Old Neil ignored them and led Klein around the boxing ring and
walked into a billiard room at the back.
In the billiard room, there were two people holding cue sticks, having
a casual conversation. When they saw Old Neil enter, they instantly
fell silent for a few seconds.
After conﬁrming the visitor’s identity, they moved aside and let Old
Neil and Klein pass through the secret door behind them.
After passing through a few rooms, the sight before Klein’s eyes
opened up. He saw a place that was about the size of a lecture hall
from his previous life.
Some vendors had set up roadside stalls with bottles and cans all
over. Passers-by strolled through them, either scrutinizing their
goods, chatting, or comparing prices.
“They have to give ﬁve percent of their proﬁts to Swain. Ah, he is the
boss of Evil Dragon Bar, former captain of a Mandated Punisher
squad and older than I am. He’s someone who wishes to drink
himself to his death,” Old Neil explained in a garrulous manner.
Klein thought and gave an honest evaluation.
“A rather proﬁtable business.”
After all, his only expense was providing the venue and protection.
“If any item catches your fancy but you lack the money, you can
borrow from Swain. But of course, he charges a very high interest…”
Old Neil trailed oﬀ as he gnashed his teeth.
As expected, it’s like running a casino, they would provide usuries… Klein
held his walking stick and looked around as he asked curiously, “Mr.
Swain is a Seafarer?”
The captain of a Mandated Punisher squad was likely a Sequence 7.
“No, he is only a Folk of Rage. Tingen is not a coastal city, so the
Church of the Goddess is much more powerful than Lord of Storms
here.” Old Neil scoﬀed. “Actually, Swain had the chance of becoming
a Seafarer, but was afraid that he would lose control so he chose to
give up.”
Just as Klein was about to ask if the boss of the bar had any
experience of nearly losing control, he suddenly felt a strange
phenomenon happen on his left.
There appeared to be something hidden there, muttering and
recounting.
Klein turned his head and saw a pale young man. He was wearing an
old linen shirt and blue jeans that the working class normally wore.
His eyes looked demoralized with a hint of craziness, and he was
constantly mumbling.
“His spiritual perception is very high… or perhaps, distorted?” Klein
creased his eyebrows and muttered.
It was the young man’s spiritual perception that triggered his own
spiritual perception!
Generally speaking, spiritual perception sensing something causes
some interaction. It was nearly impossible to conceal it from others,
but “others” referred to Spirit Mediums who had cast their abilities,
as well as powerful ﬁgures with similar special traits. A Beyonder like
Klein would actually ﬁnd it hard to detect, only detecting if one’s
spiritual perception reached a certain heightened level, or an
abnormal distortion happened.
They made eye contact and the pale young man with messy black
hair walked towards him with an expression looking as though he
was half-sleepwalking and half-insane.
He stopped before Klein and stared at him.
Suddenly, he guﬀawed.
“Haha, it’s the smell of death, death… Ah!”
Before he was done talking, he suddenly screamed tragically. His eyes
shut tightly as liquid with the color of blood ﬂowed out.
“Ah! Darn it!” The young man covered his eyes and hugged his head.
He struggled on the ground and only calmed down after a while. He
then lay there panting.
During the entire process, not a single customer or stall vendor
looked over.
Klein pressed down his halved top hat and looked at Old Neil. Klein’s
mouth was hanging open in shock, using his actions to demonstrate
his shock and to request for advice.
“Don’t mind him. He’s Ademisaul, an orphan, nicknamed ‘monster.’
He was born with high spiritual perception, and he has always been
able to see things that he shouldn’t, hear voices that he shouldn’t.
Hence, he is always raving and often getting hurt.” Old Neil shook his
head as he explained.
He could tell that my body was once dead? Klein knitted his eyebrows
and lowered his voice as he asked in doubt, “Haven’t the Nighthawks,
Mandated Punishers, or the Machinery Hivemind ever thought of
taking him in?”
“No, we do not have the Sequence potion that suits him,” said Old
Neil with a sigh.
Right, he was born with the starting point of half a Sequence… Klein
asked again curiously,
“What Sequence pathway suits him?”
“The Sequence 9 that suits him is called ‘Monster.’ His nickname
came from there. It’s a pity that only the Life School of Thought has
control over the Sequence pathway’s beginning,” Old Neil replied
softly.
He tried to keep the conversation between him and Klein from the
people around them to avoid leaking information to mysticism
aﬁcionados.
Life School of Thought? Klein recalled the information he had
previously read.
The secret organization appeared in the beginning of the current
epoch. Its actual origins were unknown, but it was mainly passed
down via master and disciple.
Their theories and beliefs were hardly known. Klein only knew that
they separated the world into three layers: the deﬁnite rational
world, also known as the absolute truth world, the spirits’ world, and
the material world.
Rumor had it that the secret organization had once produced a
Soothsayer… Wasn’t that a Sequence pathway that corresponded to Seer?
Confusing, really confusing…Klein shook his head and saw Ademisaul
struggle to get up and then wander oﬀ to another corner.
He reorganized his thoughts and followed behind Old Neil. They
walked past one stall after another. There were plants like moon
ﬂower, ﬁngered citron, night vanilla, and mineral resources like
silver, topaz, ruby and so on.
“It’s really very well equipped…” Klein muttered softly.
The mysticism aﬁcionados of all ages and genders around him would
be stopping, distinguishing, or talking at times. It gave the area a
bustling vibe.
“Walk around on your own. I am going to settle my bill.” Old Neil
pointed at one of the two rooms at the end.
“Alright.” Klein nodded without thought.
He strolled with his black cane and came before a stall which sold
self-made amulets. He took a careful look at it for a while.
Just when Klein prepared to speak with the seller, he suddenly heard
someone asking the stall behind him, “Is this powder ground from
cow teeth paeonol?”
Cow teeth paeonol? Isn’t that one of the supplementary ingredients of the
Spectator potion? Klein thought, then turned around to look at the
inquirer.
Justice had repeated the formula for the potion several times, so
Klein had been left with a remarkably clear impression of the
ingredients.
Chapter 69: Protection Amulet
Klein looked over and saw the person inquiring about the cow teeth
paeonol.
The man was less than a meter away from him. He was wearing a
black suit and a halved top hat of the same color. He had a cane
adorned with silver in his hand and a pair of gold-framed spectacles
on his face. He had a reﬁned bearing.
“Yes, do you need it? This can here costs three soli.” The owner of
the stall was wearing a long black robe, one ﬁlled mysticism traits.
The inquirer whose sideburns were pale yellow thought for a moment
before saying, “Can it be cheaper? I still need to buy other
ingredients too. For example, this bottle of white-edged sunﬂower
petals.”
The stall owner considered for a few seconds before grudgingly
replying, “Two soli and six pence. I don’t think you can ﬁnd a price
cheaper than that.”
Klein immediately felt that he was overthinking things after seeing
how the bespectacled man was buying ingredients other than the cow
teeth paeonol.
However, he still tapped his glabella twice as an act of caution. He
swept the man with his Spirit Vision.
No problems. He looks very healthy. His emotions are alright too. Mister,
you need to keep this up… Klein retracted his gaze, turned around, and
looked at the stall selling homemade amulets once again.
The amulets were placed neatly before him. Some of them were made
of pure silver, some with steel, others forged from gold.
But only a few of the amulets had a weak aura emanating from them,
some crimson, some pale white, some golden.
This meant that some of them had weak traces of spirituality and
were deﬁnitely eﬀective to a certain extent!
Klein looked at the amulets carefully and conﬁrmed that the stall
owner making the amulets had some foundation in mysticism.
The stall owner did not make any mistakes matching the diﬀerent
energy sources to the diﬀerent incantations. He was also extremely
accurate at choosing the materials that corresponded to the diﬀerent
energy sources.
Of course, a mere mysticism aﬁcionado would deﬁnitely make some
mistakes. Klein noticed that the stall owner did not fully understand
the incantations. One could not create an incantation simply by
translating the content of the prayer into Hermes. The incantations
had to follow a certain format that followed unique rules.
The other problem was that the stall owner had made mistakes of
varying degrees when he was choosing a suitable symbol for the
energy sources. That explained why there were only two or three
amulets releasing the faint light out of the dozens that were laid
before him.
As for how much of an eﬀect the two to three amulets would have,
Klein could only say that it was better than nothing.
An amulet that was truly equipped with obvious eﬀects needed the
craftsman to release his spirituality from a blade while carving the
incantations and symbols!
If one wanted even better results, they would have to supplement it
with ritualistic magic.
And these two things were not something an ordinary person could
achieve.
Klein tapped his glabella twice, then pointed at the upper left corner
of the stall with his black cane.
“How much for these two?”
He did not ask about the amulets that had a rudimentary colored
aura, but half-completed items. Other than external shape, they had
not been carved with incantations or symbols.
To Klein, there was no reason to purchase the amulets that had weak
eﬀects. What he wanted to do was to transform the half-completed
amulets into true amulets.
Hmm, I’ll make amulets that can protect a person from danger, one each
for Benson and Melissa. As for my own, I can ask the Nighthawks to
supply me with the ingredients… Man, I must have been inﬂuenced by Old
Neil. I don’t feel any guilt when doing something like that… Klein’s mind
wandered as he watched the stall owner pick up the half-completed
silver amulets.
The ﬁrst silver amulet was elongated and had a cavity in the middle.
Around it were patterns of angel-like feathers. The craftsmanship was
intricate and was very beautiful. The other was simple, almost
completely devoid of any additional decorations or carvings. It had a
vertical line representing the night, and a circle representing the
crimson moon.
Klein, who paid much attention to appearances, took a liking to them
immediately.
“This is six soli,” the middle-aged stall owner said, pointing to the
intricate amulet. He was a man of few words.
After pausing for a while, he rubbed the simpler piece and said, “This
is ﬁve soli three pence.”
“That’s too expensive. They are still far from being an amulet.” Klein
had slowly been inﬂuenced by Benson and Melissa, so he had begun
cultivating the habit of haggling.
After a battle of words, he bought the two silver accessories at ﬁve
soli six pence and four soli nine pence respectively.
Yeah, they can only be considered silver accessories for the time being…
Klein had that in mind.
The ten soli three pence was deducted from the reimbursement he
received for his Divination Club membership.
Klein received the two silver accessories and placed them into his
pocket. He was about to head to another stall when he heard a gentle
voice.
“Sir, why are you not buying a completed amulet?”
Klein turned his head over and found a teenage girl asking him the
question. She was about ﬁfteen years of age and wore a lacy yellow
dress while holding onto a veiled hat with a ribbon.
“It’s because I intend to make my own amulets. As you know, that is
the wish of every aﬁcionado of mysticism,” Klein minced his words
and answered.
He did not wish to make the stall owner think that he was trying to
snatch his business, even though he had considered using his “skill”
to earn a quick buck.
The teenage girl had naturally curly brown hair, and her face was
adorable due to her baby fat. She looked at Klein with her light blue
eyes and asked sincerely, “Can I seek your advice on choosing an
amulet? Well, I was introduced here by a friend. I’ve been here
several times and have a deep interest in mysticism. But I still do not
know too much about it, and she, my friend, is going to turn sixteen
soon. I wish to select an amulet as a gift to her. I didn’t bring her
along as I want it to be a surprise… I had previously sought her
advice, but I cannot remember a lot of the critical points.”
Klein gave a gentlemanly smile.
“What kind of protection amulets are you looking for? Something to
avert disasters? Something to avoid illnesses? Something that gives
fortune? Diﬀerent requirements would require diﬀerent energy
sources which means that they must point to diﬀerent gods. Diﬀerent
gods would have diﬀerent corresponding constellations, and the
diﬀerent constellations would mean that diﬀerent materials have to
be used.
“For example, the incantation for averting disasters would belong to
the Empress of Disaster and Horror, who is the Evernight Goddess. As
mysticism aﬁcionados, we all know that the symbol of the Evernight
Goddess is the moon. The corresponding metal would thus be pure
silver.
“Therefore, if we hope to avert disasters, it is best that we choose an
amulet that is made of pure silver and has the corresponding
incantations.”
We would also have to make sure that the incantations are of the correct
language and format. The corresponding symbol of the Empress of
Disaster and Horror means the Path Number, the spell’s characteristic,
and the relative positions of the symbols, etc, must also be correct… But
this is too complicated, and there’s no need for me to explain this for
you… Klein added inwardly.
The girl’s eyes sparkled. She asked with a little doubt, “Can a
follower of the Goddess wear an amulet belonging to another god?”
“No problem. The gods do not mind such small matters,” Klein
consoled her.
It was not a problem for the person wearing the amulet, but the
person creating the amulet had to be careful. If a believer of the Lord
of Storms were to craft an amulet of the Eternal Blazing Sun, they
would most likely receive something malicious.
Of course, these referred to amulets requiring the aid of ritualistic
magic. The craftsman need not pay much attention to this otherwise.
The teenage girl heaved a sigh of relief.
“I hope to get her an amulet for good health; which deity should I
choose from? The Eternal Blazing Sun, Mother Earth, or the God of
Knowledge and Wisdom?”
“There should be no problem with the Eternal Blazing Sun and
Mother Earth. The former is represented by the sun while the latter is
represented by the Brown Star.” Klein smiled as he said, “The
material of the sun is gold, while the metal that symbolizes the
Brown Star is lead. I would suggest the sun, but I do not know if you
brought enough money along with you.”
The reason for his suggestion was because he had noticed that among
the three amulets with a rudimentary spiritual glow, one of them was
a health amulet that came under the domain of the sun.
“Isn’t this…” Before the teenage girl ﬁnished her sentence, she
stopped and warily looked at the stall owner who was waiting
silently.
She thought for a moment before asking, “After I decide on the
material, how should I distinguish the incantation and corresponding
symbols?”
“Do you know Hermes?” Klein asked instead.
“I just started learning it,” the teenage girl replied, a little
embarrassed.
“Then let me choose it for you.” Klein pointed at the health amulet
made of gold and said, “This one has no problems, be it in the
incantations or the representing symbol.”
The teenage girl lifted the edges of her dress and squatted in front of
the amulet. She picked up the health amulet with designs of the sun’s
rays around its edges. She felt as though the amulet was nourishing
her, making her feel completely relaxed.
“Thank you, thank you.” She stood up and curtsied in gratitude.
Klein laughed and said, “I’ll leave the rest to you and the stall owner.
I have other things to tend to.”
He looked at the stall owner as he spoke and noticed that the man
had a weird look in his eyes, as if deciding if he had to give a cut of
the proﬁt to Klein.
With a smile, Klein did not bother with the matter anymore. He
continued touring the underground market, but he didn’t notice any
true extraordinary materials.
At this point, Old Neil had already paid oﬀ his debt. He was holding
a dark colored wooden box in his hands.
He pointed to the other room behind and said after he noticed Klein’s
look of doubt, “Go there if you wish to buy or sell extraordinary
materials. After all, no one wishes to let others know what
extraordinary items they are purchasing.”
“I understand.” Klein nodded as though in thought.
There was no need for him to go there for the time being. He headed
toward the exit of the underground market together with Old Neil.
“How much for these elf ﬂowers?”
A query suddenly entered Klein’s ears.
Elf ﬂowers… That’s also an ingredient for the Spectator potion… Klein
thought as he glanced sideways. He once again saw the reﬁned
bespectacled man.
“What’s the matter?” Old Neil asked curiously.
“Nothing much.” Klein retracted his gaze.
Although he was a quasi-member of the Nighthawks, he did not feel
that all Beyonders had to be absorbed by the Churches or locked up.
He believed that it had to depend on the situation. Spectators
deﬁnitely posed little danger to society or the kingdom, and the
chances of losing control as a Sequence 9 were very slim.
…
After leaving Evil Dragon Bar, Klein and Old Neil took a public
carriage and left the harbor. They then split ways at the North
Borough and headed back to their respective homes.
The public transport steered into Daﬀodil Street and stopped by the
side of the road. Klein was about to get oﬀ the carriage when he
suddenly saw a young lady wearing a grayish-white dress about to
board the carriage.
This lady had smooth black hair, her face a little round. She had thin
eyes and unassuming features. But paired together, she gave oﬀ the
feeling that she was sweet and gentle.
Klein noticed her not because of her beauty, but because he
discovered that her body was shuddering slightly. It was an unnatural
shudder.
“Miss, are you alright?” Klein asked in concern.
The young lady shook her head abruptly.
“No, I-I am just too tired.”
The people behind Klein were urging for him to get oﬀ, so Klein
could only leave the carriage.
When he found his footing, he paid attention to the situation from
before again. He pinched his glabella twice, planning to determine if
the lady was indeed alright.
He had the intention of sending her to the hospital if she had a
serious illness that was going to act up soon.
Activating his Spirit Vision, the colors of the auras started to surface.
Klein turned around and prepared to look at the sweet and gentle
young lady.
Chapter 70: 2-049's Arrival
Clip-clop, clip-clop.
The horses widened their paces as the wheels began rolling in tow.
Despite activating his Spirit Vision and turning around, hoping to
observe the reﬁned and sweet lady, Klein did not have his wishes
fulﬁlled. All his eyes reﬂected were brown ﬁgures moving past him.
Meanwhile, the passengers from the stop had already boarded the
carriage. The carriage door was closed tightly as it gradually
departed.
Within the carriage, twenty to thirty people stood closely to each
other, their energy ﬁelds overlapping and shielding each other.
Hence, it was an explosion of colors in Klein’s vision, making it
diﬃcult for him to diﬀerentiate.
He shook his head quietly and raised his ﬁnger to tap his glabella to
deactivate his Spirit Vision.
To him, it was simply help he could provide if he happened to chance
upon it. However, if he were to miss it, and the situation was not
especially clear, there was no point taking it to heart and delaying his
own matters.
While bathing in the crimson moonlight, Klein strolled back home on
the still bustling Daﬀodil Street. He returned to see Melissa sitting
beside the dining table. She was busy doing her homework under a
bright gas lamp.
She bit at the fountain pen and frowned, appearing deep in thought.
“Where’s Benson?” Klein asked casually.
“Ah…” Melissa looked up. She blanked out for a few seconds before
saying, “He said he went around a few boroughs today and was
covered in sweat. He’s taking a nice relaxing bath.”
“Alright.” Klein chuckled. Suddenly, he realized that she was wearing
a dress he had never seen before.
It was entirely beige in color. It had fashionable engageantes. The
collar and edges of her top had thin frills. Apart from that, it was a
rather simple design, the type one wore as daily casual clothing. It
fully accentuated the youth of a sixteen or seventeen-year-old.
“New dress?” Klein asked with a smile.
It was a purchase that he and Benson had insisted upon.
Melissa answered in the aﬃrmative tersely.
“I just took it back from Mrs. Rochelle. I was thinking that since I had
to wash it later, I might as well try it on ﬁrst.”
Klein was rather puzzled when he heard that.
“Mrs. Rochelle?”
Wasn’t she our former neighbor?
Melissa nodded and explained in all seriousness, “Mrs. Rochelle is
actually a seamstress, but she was quite unlucky. She had no choice
but to sew and mend clothes for others at home. She leads a pretty
tough life. I knew that she had pretty good skill and the price she
quoted is cheaper than at a women’s clothing store. Furthermore, it’s
very well-tailored to my ﬁgure, so I ordered a new skirt from her. It
only cost nine soli and ﬁve pence and took only a few days. A dress
of a similar style would cost three halves of a pound at Harrods
Department Store!”
What a frugal girl… Sis, I know that at least half the reason is due to
your pity of Mrs. Rochelle… Klein did not reproach Melissa for
deciding things for herself. Instead, he said with a smile, “When did
you go to Harrods?”
That was at Howes Street, near the Divination Club. It was
somewhere where the middle-class shopped.
“…” Melissa was momentarily at a loss for words. It took her a long
while before she said, “It was Selena and Elizabeth. They insisted I
accompany them. Actually, well—I actually prefer gears more. I like
places with steam and machinery. Yeah.”
“It’s quite, well—nice for a girl to occasionally shop at a department
store.” Klein laughed as he comforted his sister.
After some idle talk, he briskly walked to the second ﬂoor, hoping to
wash away the repulsive mixed smells from the bar.
Just as he was about to return to his bedroom to get a change of
clothes, he suddenly heard sounds coming from the bathroom close
to the balcony.
A few seconds later, Benson stepped out while drying his gradually
receding hairline.
“How was it? Did you compliment Melissa’s new dress?” He shot a
glance at Klein and asked with a smile.
“I guess I forgot. All I did was ask where it was done…” Klein
thought for a moment as he said.
Benson immediately chortled and shook his head.
“How unbecoming of an elder brother. When Melissa received the
dress, she couldn’t bear putting it down. After rushing to cook and
wash the dishes, she immediately wore the dress and has refused to
take it oﬀ ever since.”
…Wasn’t she planning on changing after showering? She can wash and
starch the clothes while doing so… Klein subconsciously refuted with
the explanation that Melissa had given.
“Tsk.” Benson sighed. “It’s been scorching the past few days. She was
busy in the kitchen for a long time, so I believe she would feel much
better doing her homework after a shower.”
That’s right… Klein was suddenly enlightened as he gave his brother a
knowing smile.
So that’s what kind of person you are, Melissa… There’s nothing wrong
with a girl caring for her appearance. There’s no need to ﬁnd excuses…
The corners of his mouth curved up as he shook his head gently
before walking into his bedroom.
While he was showering, Klein faintly heard knocking downstairs. He
immediately wondered.
Doesn’t the worker who’s in charge of collecting coins for the gas meter
come only once every two weeks?
Could it be Mrs. Shaud from next door? That can’t be. It’s said that this
lady strictly abides by the etiquette of middle-class society. She would not
visit at an inappropriate time.
In his puzzlement, Klein wiped dry his body. Wearing old but
comfortable shirt and trousers, he came down the stairs.
He surveyed the area but did not notice any strangers. He asked,
“Was someone at the door just now?”
Benson, who was reading the newspapers casually, said with a smile,
“It was Bitsch Mountbatten, one of the policemen in charge of Iron
Cross Street. He asked if we met an eighteen or nineteen-year-old boy
who has a rotund face. Heh, he even gave us a sketch to identify.
Unfortunately, neither one of us have seen him, or we would have
received a reward. What about you?”
“Nope.” Klein had a general idea what was happening.
Instigator Tris had successfully escaped the Evil Dragon Bar at the
harbor. He had escaped somewhere close to Iron Cross Street and
Daﬀodil Street; therefore, the police were making visits from door to
door.
And to go this far made it clear that the operation of nabbing the
Instigator had completely failed!
Klein did not bother himself with the situation. He had yet to begin
combat training. He only had basic mastery of shooting, so to
consider dealing with a natural ‘Assassin’ was simply using his life as
a joke.
He did not sleep well that night. He kept worrying that the Instigator
would inﬁltrate their house to hide, causing another massacre.
Thankfully, Daﬀodil Street was quiet the entire night, with the
morning sun rays dispersing all the fog.
The relaxed Klein changed into formal attire, wore his top hat, held
his cane, and went all the way to Zouteland Street. He greeted
Rozanne at the reception hall.
“Good morning, Klein,” replied Rozanne happily. She suppressed her
voice and said, “I heard the huge operation last night failed?”
“The operation to nab Instigator Tris?” Klein asked in curiosity.
“Yeah!” Rozanne nodded heavily. She shot a glance at the partition
and said, “Apparently an informant of the Mandated Punishers
discovered the Instigator at the harbor… They were planning on
waiting for additional Beyonders and another Special Operations
squad from the police to arrive before beginning the operation to do
the deed instantly without alarming the commoners. Unfortunately,
that Instigator was extremely sharp. He charged out of the
encirclement when he noticed something amiss, successfully escaping
as a result.”
“At such times, they need a Beyonder with tracking abilities, such as
me.” Klein made a joke.
“There was no lack of trackers back then.” Dunn Smith’s voice
suddenly sounded.
Rozanne turned her head abruptly and saw the captain wearing his
black windbreaker. He was glaring right at her with his deep pair of
gray eyes while leaning against the partition’s frame.
She hurriedly raised her hands to cover her mouth. Then, she shook
her head incessantly, expressing her futile innocence.
Dunn turned his gaze to Klein and after some thought, he said,
“There were a total of six Beyonders from the Mandated Punishers,
the Machinery Hivemind, and us Nighthawks. We traced the injured
Tris to Iron Cross Street’s Lower Street. We found his temporary
residence, but the clues ended there. Be it Beyonder methods or
ordinary investigations, nothing worked. It was as though he
evaporated into thin air, disappearing completely.”
“Do you need my help with divination?” Klein asked probingly.
Dunn shook his head gently.
“The Machinery Hivemind had a Machinery Hivemind. He is a senior
Beyonder as good as Old Neil. I even suspect that he’s already at
Sequence 8. I’m just unaware what the name of the corresponding
potion is.”
“The Theosophy Order’s heritage to this day must have something
special about it,” consoled Klein.
For the rest of the morning, he continued his mysticism curriculum,
read the historical information and documents, and practiced various
techniques just like always.
With lunchtime almost approaching, Klein’s mind began to wander.
Another few minutes later, he put away the documents, having heard
the summoning of his stomach.
At that moment, Dunn Smith came into the clerk oﬃce. He said in a
deep but mild manner, “Klein, follow me to Chanis Gate. Sealed
Artifact 2-049 has arrived. The subsequent operation might require
your sensing of that notebook.”
“…Alright,” Klein got up and replied.
His thoughts became scrambled. He imagined how the sealed item
would look or if the operation would be dangerous.
While in this rather tense silence, he followed Dunn down the stairs
and into the tunnel.
After going straight at the intersection, Dunn suddenly stopped and
turned his head, saying sternly, “Do this action together with me.
Keep doing it and absolutely do not stop. Remember, absolutely do
not stop. This is for your own safety!”
While speaking, Dunn bent his arm followed by extending it. He
repeated this action without stopping.
Klein looked at the captain demonstrate in a befuddled manner.
Suddenly enlightened, he asked, “Has this got to do with the
uniqueness of the Sealed Artifact?”
“Yes.” Dunn nodded with abnormal seriousness. “Repeating such an
action will allow us to discover if anything happens to you
immediately. Saving you in time will not result in any life-
threatening dangers.”
“Okay.” Klein did not hesitate further as he began the repeated action
of bending and extending his arm.
“If your arm is sore, use the other one,” added Dunn.
Sealed Artifact “2-049” sure is odd… What meaning does this action
have? It seems very dangerous… These thoughts ﬂashed past Klein’s
mind as he looked solemnly at the captain.
“Alright.”
He had too many questions on his mind, but since Chanis Gate was in
sight, he had no choice but to bear with it.
Besides, with my security clearance, I’ll probably not learn of the details. I
can only do as I’m ordered… Klein exhaled as he followed Captain
Dunn to the Keeper room outside Chanis Gate.
Chapter 71: Sluggish
Phenomenon
Klein repeatedly bent and extended his arm as he watched Dunn push
open the Keeper’s room with his body sideways.
The captain’s carefulness and high alertness, as well as the ridiculous
and laughable “protective actions,” left him feeling abnormally
tensed. The feeling was identical to what he felt when taking tests of
courage that required him to walk through spooky cemeteries at
night in his youth.
A Grade 2 Sealed Artifact. Dangerous. To be used with care and
moderation… It is something even a formal Nighthawk member does not
know the details to… It is unknown how dangerous it is… Amid his tense
nerves, Klein found it impossible to curb himself from overthinking.
At that moment, his brain suddenly turned numb as though a power
switch had been ﬂicked oﬀ.
Everything in Klein’s vision turned slow. Even his arm actions shared
the same fate.
He saw Captain Dunn stop in his tracks. He came close to him as
though in slow motion, extending his palm out slowly before pushing
him in the shoulder.
Suddenly, Klein’s thought processes and vision were restored to
normal at the same time. It was as though everything from before
was just an illusion.
“What happened?” he whispered amid his fright and confusion.
Dunn shook his head and said in a deep voice, “Observe carefully.”
The moment he ﬁnished his sentence, he turned around and walked
into the Keeper’s room. Klein followed closely behind and saw four
other people in the room; they were either seated or standing.
One of them was the Midnight Poet, Leonard. The other three were
people Klein had never met before. However, all of them shared a
common trait. They were all doing the extending and bending arm
“exercise” with utmost seriousness.
“Klein Moretti has a miraculous connection with the Antigonus
family’s notebook.” Dunn gave a brief introduction.
Then, he pointed to the other three strangers and said, “These lady
and gentlemen are colleagues from the Backlund diocese. They
escorted Sealed Artifact 2-049 here. This is Madam Lorotta, Sequence
8 Gravedigger. She is a master sharpshooter.”
At that moment, the black-haired woman who looked about thirty
nodded at Klein in a friendly manner.
She looked pretty good. She did not wear a hat and was dressed in
what appeared like male attire—a black coat with a white shirt, tight
black trousers and black leather boots. The corners of her mouth
were slightly curved up.
After Klein exchanged greetings, Dunn pointed to a man seated
behind the desk.
“Aiur Harson, someone just like me.”
Before he ﬁnished his sentence, Klein saw Mr. Aiur Harson in his gray
windbreaker turn sluggish with his arm motion. It was as though a
gear had lost its lubricant or a joint covered in rust.
What’s wrong… Amid Klein’s daze, he saw Lorotta push Aiur Harson.
Only then did the gentleman’s actions return to normal.
Was I like that previously? Klein was ﬁrst taken aback before he came
to the realization.
This indicated the dangers that Sealed Artifact 02-49 held!
What would happen if one was not awoken in time?
Would one become a zombie?
Filled with questions, Klein greeted the charming middle-aged Aiur
Harson.
“Borgia,” Dunn said as he pointed to the last Nighthawk.
Borgia was a cold man with a knife scar on the side of his face. His
sharp brown eyes were like an eagle’s. He was constantly observing
everyone in the room.
“Let’s set oﬀ. The faster we end this, the faster we can seal 2-049,”
the handsome Aiur Harson said as he stood, his eyes revealing some
wrinkles.
So, where is 2-049? Klein surveyed his surroundings curiously but did
not notice any traces of the Sealed Artifact. Of course, he could not
see the areas obscured by the table without activating his Spirit
Vision.
“Alright,” Dunn turned and looked at Leonard Mitchell. “You’ll be in
charge of driving. It is best not to involve Cesare with matters like
this.”
Cesare was the clerk in charge of procuring and collecting supplies
for the Tingen Nighthawks while standing in as a carriage driver. He
was the one who drove Klein to Welch’s home to meet the Spirit
Medium Daly.
“No problem.” Leonard stopped acting frivolous and nodded
seriously.
At that moment, Klein saw Aiur Harson bending over. He picked up a
black metal chest which had been obscured by the table.
The chest was carved with resplendent stars and the crimson full
moon. It was as though there was a formless barrier around the chest.
The Sealed Artifact should be inside there? I wonder what 2-049 looks
like… Klein observed the chest curiously.
Thump!
Thump! Thump!
Violent knocking sounds suddenly erupted from the black chest. Even
the surface of the chest bulged time and time again.
Thump! Thump! Thump!
It was as though something horrifying had awakened within the chest
and was pounding wildly. The sound of the knocking was beaten into
the hearts of everyone present.
It’s alive? Just as Klein had a thought, he saw Captain Dunn’s arm
exercises turning sluggish, as if his joints were layered with glue.
Borgia, the Nighthawk from Backlund, pushed Dunn’s shoulder,
allowing him to recover.
It’s like doing the robot dance when one is aﬀected by 2-049… If all of us
are under its inﬂuence, wouldn’t we be some awkward dance squad…
Luckily, 2-049 seems capable of only inﬂuencing one person at a time…
Klein lampooned to relax his tense nerves. He did not dare halt his
arm exercises.
He followed Dunn’s lead and left his cane behind. He then followed
behind the ﬁve Nighthawks through the tunnel and up the stairs to
the second ﬂoor of the Blackthorn Security Company.
Leonard had gone ahead and notiﬁed everyone in the front of the
buildings, so Rozanne and the rest had all made their way to the
third level. These incidents rarely involved them, but they were not
completely alien to them. Another Nighthawk, Kenley, had replaced
Dunn in his watch over Chanis Gate.
Klein heaved a sigh of relief when he reached the carriage. He looked
suspiciously out the window and said, “Won’t 2-049 aﬀect the
ordinary people on the streets?”
From their journey underground to the carriage, Sealed Artifact
2-049 had already caused six sluggish incidents, two of which were
targeted at him. He had been jolted awake by Captain Dunn and
Leonard Mitchell respectively. The rate of the sluggish eﬀect was
rather alarming!
“No worries, 2-049 will target humanoid creatures within ﬁve meters
of it ﬁrst. The closer you are to it, the easier it is for you to be
chosen. As long as there are three people surrounding it, people who
happen to be around when the carriage steers past will not be
aﬀected,” the beautiful, black-haired lady Lorotta explained with a
lazy tone.
What a weird Sealed Artifact… Klein thought as he continued his arm
exercises.
Dunn and the rest of the Nighthawks did not speak on the journey to
Ray Bieber’s house. They were paying close attention to each other’s
condition. Only Lorotta wore a nonchalant look. At times, she took in
the sights of Tingen’s not-so-clean streets, and at other times, she
praised Backlund’s underground water system.
Soon after, the familiar building ﬁnally entered Klein’s line of sight.
The group of six made their way to the third level while observing
each other.
The door to Ray Bieber’s house was labeled with the Tingen Police
Department’s symbol, indicating that entry was forbidden to
unauthorized personnel.
As Dunn did his stretching exercises, he took out a key. He opened
the newly changed lock, then turned around, allowing Aiur Harson
who was carrying the black chest to enter ﬁrst.
Thump!
Thump! Thump! Thump!
The Sealed Artifact in the black chest knocked violently once again,
even more violent than before. This made Aiur Harson’s arm waver
from side to side uncontrollably. It even made Klein suspect that the
chest would be pounded open in time.
Thump! Thump! Thump!
Klein quickly noticed that Captain Dunn’s movements were becoming
sluggish. He was about to wake him up when a buzz sounded in his
brain. His brain became numb, the scenes before his eyes played as
though they were in slow motion.
Didn’t they say that… that it only aﬀects one… person at a time…
Klein’s thoughts quickly became sluggish.
At this moment, the prepared Lorotta and Borgia woke each of them
up respectively by pushing them.
Having his thought processes and vision restored, Klein looked
around with lingering fear. He nearly blurted out.
“Didn’t you say that 2-049 can only aﬀect one person at a time?”
Thankfully, I did not stop my stretches!
“When Sealed Artifact 2-049 enters its berserk mode, it can aﬀect up
to two people at once. We can conﬁrm that Ray Bieber is indeed a
descendant of the Antigonus family,” Aiur Harson said with a
mechanical tone.
Lorota let out a faint laugh. She looked at Klein and said, “2-049
becomes very agitated when it meets a descendant of the Antigonus
family, even if only their scent remains. Its abilities would also
increase considerably. I believe you would be able to understand its
feelings.”
Well, I don’t… Klein asked curiously, “So, is it a living creature?”
Lorotta smiled but did not reply him directly.
“You’ll know in a while. As long as Ray Bieber hasn’t escaped Tingen,
2-049 will lead us to him.”
Klein could only put his other questions on hold as he walked around
the room with the Nighthawks.
Amid the loud and violent thumping from the chest, they locked the
door, walked down the stairs, and returned to the carriage.
Aiur Harson looked out the window several times and conﬁrmed that
there were no pedestrians within a ﬁve-meter radius of them. He then
placed the black chest on the ground and twisted the mechanical
switch to release its spiritual restraints.
The violent thumping stopped suddenly, slipping the entire carriage
into silence. Not even the breaths of the Nighthawks could be heard.
Klein held his breath as the black chest opened slowly. A sharp creak
that hurt his ears could be heard.
Creak!
The chest fell as a slender brown arm extended out of the chest. It
was about the length of a child’s ﬁnger.
Two arms pressed forward one after another as an object about the
size a normal human being’s palm appeared bit by bit in front of
Klein and company.
It had clear elbow, ﬁnger, and knee joints. Covered in an oil-stained
brown cloth, its face was painted with the colors of a clown—red and
yellow.
It was a wooden puppet with a weird appearance!
2-049 lifted its head and looked at Klein with its pure black eyes.
Its rigid mouth slowly parted to reveal a clown-like smile.
Chapter 72: Tracking
The wooden puppet’s face was painted in red and yellow like the
common clown. The corners of its mouth were upturned high,
revealing an abnormally comical smile.
Its lips parted to reveal a dark and deep mouth. Klein, who had
locked his gaze with it, felt his hair stand as intense horror leaped out
of his heart in an uncontrollable manner.
Everything before his eyes grew dull, as though he was looking at the
world through a piece of thick brown glass.
Klein’s thoughts slowed down gradually, and he instinctively wanted
to ask for help, but his neck seemed to be held tight by a rope. He
couldn’t make a single sound, and the single word was trapped in
silence.
Just then, Dunn noticed his arm exercises becoming sluggish and
pushed him heavily.
The brown glass before Klein’s eyes shattered in an instant. He
blurted out the word “help” which had remained dormant in his
throat. It reverberated within the carriage, with sharp panic.
“It’s getting stronger,” Klein spoke in a very certain tone.
Being next to a strange Sealed Artifact like 2-049 really placed on in
terrifying peril if they were not careful. No, it was totally impossible
to guard against it. It could only be avoided through other methods!
“It’s normal,” Aiur Harson said steadily, nodding.
Lorotta chuckled.
“It seems to like you? Don’t worry. It is a relatively less dangerous
Grade 2 Sealed Artifact.”
In her naturally languid voice, the puppet whose joints clearly
reﬂected a human’s stood up. It began tottering towards its left.
Its action was incomprehensible, just like a steam engine that
someone had rusted due to a lack of lubricating oil.
Robot dance… Klein suddenly had the few Chinese words pop into his
head. He had a new guess of the danger 2-049 posed.
It assimilates the living things that it seizes control of?
If I am not woken up in time by the others, would I have become a
human-sized puppet, a real-life Barbie doll?
Just as thoughts ﬂooded Klein, Aiur Harson was awoken by Dunn. He
extended and bent his arms as he pointed in the direction that the
puppet was walking slowly towards. He said to Leonard who was
driving the carriage, “Over there!”
Leonard couldn’t make the carriage pass through the building, so he
had to detour. During the detour, 2-049 constantly adjusted the
direction that it was facing. It acted like a compass that pointed
towards the Antigonus family.
Upon seeing the scene, Klein, who was constantly “exercising” his
arms, nearly burst out laughing under the tension.
I heard that 2-049 was created by the Antigonus family… Is this an act of
loyalty or the perfect example of screwing things up?
Leonard drove the carriage according to Aiur Harson’s occasional
instructions.
Whenever the strange puppet 2-049 walked to the edge of the
carriage, Aiur Harson would pull it back and start it all over again.
Every time that happened, its mouth would open and two people
would be under its inﬂuence simultaneously.
Klein’s taut feelings gradually began to relax. He realized that Sealed
Artifact 2-049 was not as scary anymore. As long as there were more
than three people present and they constantly maintained their arm
motions, if they made sure to wake their partners in time, 2-049 was
merely a puppet with slightly unique characteristics.
The carriage traveled at high speed, and quickly arrived at the
harbor, where warehouses were clustered.
After circling a few times, they conﬁrmed that 2-049 intended to
enter the innermost grayish-white warehouse. Aiur Harson’s
expression turned solemn. He grabbed the puppet carefully and
stuﬀed it back into the black chest.
Thump! Thump! Thump!
Under constant ferocious knocking, Aiur woke up again and again
with the help of Borgia and Lorotta as he activated the mechanism
with great eﬀort. He then injected his spirituality and activated the
star and crimson symbols on the chest.
At the reappearance of the formless seal, Aiur Harson let out a long
heavy breath.
“Let’s get down,” Dunn Smith said with a low and mild voice.
“Leonard, tying the horse here will do.”
Dressed in windbreakers, suits, or shirts, the six left the carriage and
walked into the innermost warehouse. As they walked, they
uniformly stretched and bent their arms.
This added a comical and ridiculous vibe to the rather tense
situation.
The Nighthawk Awkward Dance Squad… Klein could only complain
inwardly to ease such a feeling.
However, there was no other way around it. According to his
observations, 2-049 ﬁrst aﬀected the upper body. Therefore, to detect
it in time to prevent a more dangerous situation from developing,
they only had the choice of extending and bending their arms, shake
their necks or bodies. However, the latter only made one look like a
hooligan.
As for actions like blinking eyes and striking one’s eyebrows, they
were either too easily ignored or the action was too big. Neither was
a good option.
This awkward dance squad is better than Causeway Bay 1 triad
members… Klein sighed in resignation and followed Captain Dunn
Smith and company.
As they approached the warehouse’s door, the deeper his anxiety and
worry became.
No one knew what kind of eﬀect the notebook had on Ray Bieber!
If something dire happened, Klein did not dare pin his hopes on
transmigrating again.
Furthermore, he discovered that he could still be injured and bleed
while chopping ingredients for dinner. The speed at which he
recovered at was normal too. He wasn’t some kind of monster that
was impervious to combat or death.
As they walked, Dunn suddenly lowered his non-moving hand and
made a pressing gesture to beckon everyone to stop ten meters away
from the warehouse’s door.
“Klein, divine if there is any danger in the warehouse. It’d be better if
you could tell the level of danger,” Dunn said as he turned his head
to Klein.
His gray eyes looked deep as usual; there was no fear.
Klein gave an unnoticeable nod and stopped the hand exercise. He
extended his right hand to his left cuﬀ and removed the silver chain
that had a hanging piece of topaz.
As he was still moving his arms, Dunn realized his sluggish actions in
time and woke him up with a nudge.
Klein held the silver chain with his left hand and allowed the topaz to
hang down naturally. Simultaneously, he moved his right arm, but
with a much smaller range of motion.
When the topaz stabilized, he half closed his eyes, outlined the
spherical light, and entered Cogitation. He then mumbled, “There’s
danger in the warehouse.”
“There’s danger in the warehouse.”
…
After seven times, he opened his eyes and saw the hanging topaz
slowly going in clockwise circles.
It turned faster and faster, and in the end, Klein felt like it was
pulling his left hand.
“There’s danger, great danger,” Klein replied honestly.
Clockwise meant aﬃrmation to the chanted statement, while counter-
clockwise meant denial.
To other Beyonders, even a Mystery Pryer, using spirit dowsing could
only determine if there was danger, but it was unable to obtain
information regarding the level of danger.
However, Klein discovered that when he used spirit dowsing, the
pendulum would spin at diﬀerent speeds, revealing the degree of the
answer.
Although it was not very accurate and extremely vague, it allowed
one to have a rough assessment of the actual situation.
As expected of a Seer potion… Klein was rather happy with the
outcome.
Just as he was about to put away the topaz pendulum, Leonard
Mitchell, who had maintained his silence, suddenly spoke.
“Divine if there is danger around us also.”
Dunn nodded in agreement. “Yes, I am worried that the Secret Order
will not give up and that it has placed Ray Bieber’s house under
constant surveillance. They could have followed us here and could
cause trouble at a critical moment.”
Klein took a deep breath and entered a calm, ethereal state once
again.
When the silver chain turned stable once again, he recited in his
heart, “There is danger surrounding us.”
…
“There is danger surrounding us.”
…
After repeating the statement, Klein opened his eyes and looked at
the silver chain.
In his dark brown eyes, the topaz pendulum ﬁrst moved
counterclockwise with diﬃculty. Then, it suddenly paused and
started moving clockwise.
“There is danger surrounding us.” Klein felt a tug on his heartstrings
as he spoke carefully.
Furthermore, someone had tried to intercept his divination, but had
lost to him in the invisible ﬁght!
Just as he spoke, an orange-yellow ﬁreball the size of a ﬁst ﬂew
towards them.
It came crashing towards the middle of the group with its blazing
speed.
Dunn Smith, who had already drawn his long-barreled revolver
before Klein did his divination, immediately raised his hand, aimed,
and pulled the trigger.
Bang!
The ﬁreball didn’t seem to be aﬀected by the gunshot but continued
its original trajectory, as though it was forcing everyone to scatter
from dodging.
Klein originally thought nothing of the troublemaker who was
following them. After all, there were six Beyonders present. They
were not even short of Sequence 8 and Sequence 7 experts. It was a
lineup that was practically unstoppable in a small city like Tingen.
But when the ﬁreball smashed down, he came to a sudden
realization.
To them, the most dangerous enemy was not the tracker nor the
troublemaker, it wasn’t even Ray Bieber who was in the warehouse in
an unknown state, but the Sealed Artifact 2-049!
Once they dispersed and the battle began, they wouldn’t be able to
wake each other in time. Then, they would turn into real-life puppets
one after another!
As these chaotic thoughts bombarded him, Klein was pulled by
Leonard aside to dodge the ﬁreball.
Without the time to feel anguish for his clothing, he saw the
Nighthawks split oﬀ into two groups while dodging. It was done very
orderly.
Poof!
The orange-yellow ﬁreball landed on the ground but didn’t stir one
bit of dust. It disappeared as though nothing had happened.
An illusion? Just as this thought came to him, Klein saw Aiur Harson
lift the black chest and threw it least ten meters away.
“Stay away from it! Watch it!” Aiur shouted.
Before he ﬁnished his shout, Leonard and Borgia had separately
approached it. They stood at least seven meters from the chest to
prevent anyone from approaching.
As for Dunn and Lorotta, they each held guns. They stood beside Aiur
Harson who had drawn a thin silver sword. They took up a formation
resembling a crescent as they rushed towards the origins of the
ﬁreball, while taking note of the peripheral regions.
Upon seeing this scene, Klein, who needed to do the arm exercises
without his cane, immediately heaved a sigh of relief. He realized he
had overlooked an important matter.
2-049 had a limited range of inﬂuence. As long as they were at a
suﬃcient distance from it, they did not need to worry about the
danger.
Klein rolled over and stood up. He stuﬀed his topaz pendulum into
his pocket with one hand while he reached into his holster for his
revolver with the other.
Chapter 73: First Battle
Under the illumination of the afternoon sun, Klein in his dust-coated
clothes quickly twisted his revolver’s barrel to remove his self-
imposed safety. He went into a shooting stance, allowing the light to
reﬂect from the bronze body of the revolver.
He held the revolver with one hand, and moved his other arm,
cautiously paying attention to anything that could happen around
him.
At the same time, he was a little worried for Captain Dunn and Mr.
Aiur Harson. After all, both were Nightmare Beyonders who
specialized in inﬂuencing the enemy from the shadows. He did not
know if they were adept at direct combat.
Just as Klein was having these considerations, Aiur Harson slowed
down, his expression becoming serene and peaceful.
He opened his mouth and recited a peaceful poem, one that seemed
to place a person into the night.
“When once the sun sinks in the west,
“And dewdrops pearl the evening’s breast;
“Almost as pale as moonbeams are,
“Or its companionable star,
“The evening primrose opens anew
“Its delicate blossoms to the dew;
“And, hermit-like, shunning the light 1 ”
…
The recital reverberated around them. Klein nearly lost his tense
feelings and completely relaxed.
He was lucky that he had experienced something similar before and
was not facing Aiur Harson. Thus, he quickly collected himself and
entered a half-cogitative state to combat the inﬂuence of the poem.
Phew… He let out a sigh of relief. He no longer had any doubts about
Dunn’s and Aiur’s direct combat abilities.
As he had only advanced recently and still did not have a deep
understanding of Sequence potions, Klein had forgotten that the
Sequence 7 Nightmare was the advancement of Sequence 8 Midnight
Poet. They could keep whatever abilities they had before and, in fact,
enjoy a small increase in their abilities.
The impression Klein had of Midnight Poets all came from Leonard
Mitchell. He knew that this “job” inherited the unique traits of a
Sleepless. They were good at combat, shooting, climbing, and
sensing. They were also adept in inﬂuencing the living creatures
around them through the use of various poems. In simpler terms,
they were violent poets.
While Aiur was reciting his poem, the large wooden crates stacked up
around them seemed to suddenly ripple like water. A man wearing a
black tuxedo and halved top hat appeared.
But this man’s face was painted in three pastel colors—red, yellow,
and white. The sides of his lips were arched high like a clown,
forming a ridiculous contrast with his formal wear that was suitable
for joining an evening banquet.
Thud! Thud! Thud! The black-haired Lorotta who had been introduced
as a sharpshooter charged forward quickly. She had a gun in one
hand and had clenched the other into a ﬁst. She made it within
inches of the suited clown in a few steps.
The suited clown seemed to be aﬀected by Aiur Harson’s poem. His
body was swaying, and he had a peaceful expression in his eyes. He
did not have any desire to retaliate.
Lorotta tilted her body with a boxing maneuver as she pulled back
her ﬁst, then punched toward the suited clown’s face.
Bang!
The air crackled as the suited clown shattered suddenly like a mirror,
pieces quickly evaporating and vanishing into thin air.
At this moment, the suited clown quickly appeared once again in the
shadows of the wooden crates a few steps away. The suited clown’s
ﬁgure outline quickly appeared again.
The person under the inﬂuence of the poem was only an illusion! It
was a performance!
The suited clown grinned again. It had a comical look as he pressed
down on his halved top hat with one hand and pointed a ﬁnger gun
with the other.
Bang!
The sound of a shot rang from the ﬁnger gun. Lorotta fell to the left
and rolled on the ﬂoor, dodging the attack.
But nothing had happened, except for the fake gunshot.
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Dunn and Aiur each lifted their guns and ﬁred steadily. The suited
clown dodged adeptly, sometimes to the right and left, sometimes
rolling on the ground. It was as if he was an acrobat act in a circus.
Suddenly, Lorotta surprisingly charged forward again. Despite being
called a sharpshooter, she was still using her ﬁsts.
Bam!
The suited clown could not dodge the attack in time and could only
lift his left arm to block the ﬁst.
Seeing the clown stop, Dunn and Aiur did not hesitate to each take
aim and pulled the trigger.
At this moment, the arm that the suited clown used to block Lorotta’s
ﬁst ignited with an orange-yellow ﬂame.
In an instant, the ﬂame enveloped the suited clown and spread
towards Lorotta.
Bang! Bang! Dunn and Aiur ﬁred their revolvers, hitting the ball of
ﬂame.
The ﬂames burned rapidly and soon, all that was left were black
ashes ﬂoating in the sky. But the suited clown once again appeared
behind the stack of wooden crates close by.
He lifted his right hand and pointed a ﬁnger gun once again.
Bang!
Amid the illusory gunshot, Lorotta suddenly stopped in her tracks.
She did not charge forward. Mud was splattering in front of her as a
bullet appeared.
The suited clown was no longer delivering an illusion with this strike!
It was hard to discern real from fake, reality from illusion.
Bang! Bang! Bang!
The suited clown shot at Dunn and Aiur repeatedly while hiding
away and appearing at random times.
Upon seeing this, Lorotta squinted and lifted the dull gold revolver in
her left hand.
Bang!
The suited clown suddenly squatted down, avoiding the fatal shot.
His halved top hat was sent ﬂying backward, falling to the ground.
The bullet had left a visible scorch mark on the hat.
After rolling a few times on the ﬂoor, the suited clown scaled the
stacks of wooden crates with the agility of a monkey. He shot air
bullets out of his ﬁnger gun from the high ground.
Aiur Hanson took a few steps back and lowered his gun. He began his
recital once again.
“Wastes its fair bloom upon the night,
“Who, blindfold to its fond caresses,
“Knows not the beauty it possesses.”
…
The suited clown jumped repeatedly between the crates. He suddenly
raised his hand to scratch his ears and looked at Aiur with a comical
smile.
Could he have stuﬀed his ears? The Sequence potion that the Secret Order
possesses sure is weird… Klein observed the ﬁght from far away as he
made silent guesses.
Just as his thoughts ﬂashed through him, he suddenly saw a ﬁgure
appear at the top of a warehouse beside him. Furthermore, it was
running straight inside where Ray Bieber was hiding.
That ﬁgure was dressed in a grayish-white uniform, one which
workers at the docks wore. His face also appeared to be painted red,
yellow, and white.
The suited clown is responsible for distracting Captain and the rest while
the other person retrieved the diary? Klein instinctively raised his right
hand and shot at the ﬁgure on the roof.
He had just taken aim when the ﬁgure suddenly squatted, switching
from running to rolling on the ground.
Bang!
Klein did not stop pulling the trigger. He saw the ﬁgure suddenly
pause, blood blooming in a spurt.
The ﬁgure looked at him in shock. While bearing the pain, he
continued charging into the warehouse.
That felt like a lucky shot… Klein twitched his lips and pulled the
trigger once again. This time, the bullet hit the wooden roof beside
the ﬁgure.
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Leonard and Borgia also shot but did not hit the ﬁgure.
Klein wanted to criticize how terrible their shooting skills were as
compared to his when he suddenly stopped pulling the trigger.
That’s right! Why must we stop him?
Didn’t I divine that there is grave danger in the warehouse just now?
Wouldn’t it be great if we let that guy be the vanguard and step on the
land mine for us?
Leonard and that Mr. Borgia must have had the same idea…
With this thought, Klein lifted the barrel of his revolver and shot at
the sky.
Bang! Bang! Bang!
As the gunshots rang, the ﬁgure managed to reach the innermost
region of the warehouse unobstructed.
He lunged downwards, slamming into the roof as he fell down with
the collapsing roof.
Immediately following the commotion, the black-haired Lorotta’s
eyes suddenly turned black. Her left hand began making a strange
pulling action.
The suited clown’s jumping actions suddenly came to a pause as his
ankle seemed to be grasped tightly by an invisible hand.
Dunn did not shoot immediately and instead pointed his revolver
downward.
He opened his mouth and by simply using his spirituality to resonate
the air around him, he produced a strange, faint and ethereal voice
without the use of his throat.
“Thus it blooms on while night is by;
“When day looks out with open eye,
“Bashed at the gaze it cannot shun,
“It faints and withers and is gone.”
…
The suited clown suddenly became limp, as if he had lost the desire
to live.
Aiur Harson lifted his handgun and took aim, his ﬁnger pulling the
trigger immediately.
In that split second, there was an abnormal and tragic wail that came
from the warehouse.
“Ah!”
The cry contained immense fear as though he had encountered an
unimaginably terrifying matter.
The hair on Klein’s body stood on end. The tragic cries came to a
sudden stop as silence was restored in the deepest parts of the
warehouse. It was a skin-crawling silence.
Bang!
Aﬀected by the cry, Aiur only managed to shoot the suited clown in
the belly.
Haaa… Haaa… Haaa! The silence was once again broken from the
deepest depths of the warehouse. What should have been soft panting
sounded. It reached a crescendo that tightened everyone’s nerves.
Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!
Inside the black chest, 2-049 had reached a frenzied state.
Chapter 74: Ray Bieber
Haa! Haa! Haa!
Thump! Thump! Thump!
The loud panting and the intense knocking alternated ﬁrst before
they resounded together. It made Klein and company extremely
nervous, as though they were hearing some evil murmur.
Taking advantage of the moment Aiur, Dunn and Lorotta had their
attention redirected, the suited clown suddenly pulled out a long
piece of paper from his pocket.
Pa! He threw it with his right hand as the slip of paper ignited into a
black ﬁery whip. Then, he lashed it towards the side of his ankle.
A ﬂeeting but tragic scream sounded as the suited clown escaped the
invisible shackles and did a backﬂip.
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Dunn, Aiur, and Lorotta shot but their bullets only ended up hitting
the wooden crates.
The suited clown did not stay any longer as he pressed down on his
wound with his right hand while escaping in a direction opposite the
warehouse.
He was so fast that in the blink of an eye, all that was left was a hint
of his back.
And before he vanished, his right hand which pressed down on his
abdomen moved towards his left arm. The wound on his stomach had
already vanished, looking completely ﬁne.
The location on his left arm which he touched with his right hand
suddenly became badly mangled, and a silver bullet appeared in the
torn ﬂesh.
Dunn and the rest didn’t chase after him because the panting from
the innermost warehouse was so loud that it was making them
nervous and insecure.
Bang!
The door of the innermost warehouse suddenly exploded and ﬂew in
all directions.
Then, something wrapped with a torn cloth ﬂew out and landed not
far from Klein.
When Klein cast his gaze over, he realized that it was an arm. Its
bloody ﬂesh had been chewed on and its white bones were cracked in
an irregular fashion as they jutted out
Pa! Pa! Pa!
One item after another ﬂew out. First it was a spray of blood,
followed by a dilated eye and an ear which had been ripped out
brutally. Finally, half a beating heart and intestines ﬁlled with
yellowish-brown objects came out.
If Klein had not seen the more gruesome giant cadaver at Ray
Bieber’s place, he would have probably vomited there and then.
His nerves were on the brink of a breakdown. After a great deal of
eﬀort to hold back his urge to shoot into the pitch-black entrance, he
ejected the empty shells from his revolver and reloaded with new
demon hunting bullets.
Bang!
Dunn drew close as he stably shot into the warehouse.
However, his bullet was like a shot into the sea. There was no audible
response.
Haa! Haa! Haa!
The loud panting sped up as grayish-white colors ﬁlled the opened
door.
With another two loud shots, Aiur Harson’s and Borgia’s bullets tore
through the whiteness, but failed to prevent the “color” from spilling
outwards. It did not leave any wounds or cause liquid to seep out.
Klein held his breath and kept himself from shooting blindly. He
watched as the whiteness slowly revealed a complete outline.
It was a humanoid creature more than two meters tall. Its limb joints
were all unnaturally twisted. It was as though they had been snapped
by someone forcefully.
White bones poked out from under its skin as the entire grayish-white
surface was ﬁlled with gullies, like a human brain that had been
stripped from its shell.
The monster had grayish-white, rotting, sticky liquid ﬂowing all over
it. Its head looked relatively normal, with deep wrinkles and pale
skin.
As it opened and closed its mouth, Klein could see a porcelain false
tooth that looked close to falling out, a few strands of bloody saliva,
and bone and ﬂesh that had been minced.
Was… Ray Bieber still even f**king human? Klein drew a silent gasp as
he felt his heart pound rapidly.
Bang!
Leonard’s demon hunting bullet hit Ray Bieber’s forehead and tore
right through it, leaving behind a deep hole.
Grayish-white liquid ﬂowed out and dripped onto the ground. The
liquid wriggled and turned into fat cream-colored maggots.
But the monster appeared completely unaﬀected. It was neither fast
nor slow when it pounced at Borgia who was closest to it. Its actual
target appeared to be the black chest that contained Sealed Artifact
2-049.
“Loss of control of Beyonder powers…” Dunn shouted in a deep
voice. “Lorotta, it looks like a dead soul, so quickly look for its
weakness!”
“Alright.” Lorotta did not speak further as she raised her hands to
press down on her eyes.
Her pupils turned gray then colorless, as though she had entered the
world of spirits and a kingdom of dead souls. She looked down at the
enemy from a higher vantage point as she searched for a “node.”
Klein saw that a normal gunshot was ineﬀective, so he did not bother
wasting more of his bullets. He lifted his hand to tap at his glabella to
activate his Spirit Vision. He planned on helping Gravedigger Lorotta.
From his vision, Monster Bieber only had one kind of spiritual glow
left. It was purely grayish-white, a whiteness ﬁlled with craziness.
Apart from that, Klein saw nothing else.
At that moment, Aiur Harson and Leonard Mitchell sang
simultaneously.
“Oh, the threat of horror, the hope of crimson cries!
“One thing at least is certain—that this Life ﬂies;
“One thing is certain, and the rest is Lies;
“The Flower that once has bloomed forever dies…”
…
The power that allowed one to enter a peaceful slumber emanated.
The twisted grayish-white monster gradually slowed down as though
it could not ﬁght against the charm of the poem.
Then, it opened its mouth and let out a shrill cry that ordinary people
were deaf to.
“Ah!”
…
Bang! Klein felt a sharp pain in his head as he automatically exited
his Spirit Vision state.
He felt warm liquid ﬂowing out of his nose, and when he
subconsciously wiped it with his hand, he discovered the back of his
hand covered in blood.
Aiur and Leonard fell back to the ground at the same time. They had
blood stains lining the corners of their lips, noses, and eyes.
Borgia, Dunn, and Lorotta each took a step or two back, the color in
their face draining.
That monster only screamed once, but it appeared to exceed what the
six Beyonders could withstand. They instantly turned extremely
weak.
Bam!
It closed in on Borgia and suddenly swung its twisted joint.
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Borgia and Dunn shot twice each, but they didn’t cause any damage
to Monster Bieber.
Bang! A blow sent Borgia ﬂying out as his long-barreled revolver fell
to the ground.
He tried to stand up a few times, but failed to do so.
The corner of Monster Bieber’s mouth had stringy liquid oozing out
as it leaped towards the black chest.
Bang!
At that crucial moment, Aiur Harson shot a bullet at the box to knock
it some distance away, preventing Monster Bieber from grabbing it.
Its momentum brought it forward by more than ten meters.
The black chest cracked and as the thumping within turned more
intense it grew more obvious.
“Found it!” The black-haired Lorotta ﬁnally spoke. “I need you to
control it for at least three seconds.”
“Alright.” Dunn didn’t delay any further. He extended his hand to tap
his glabella and closed his eyes.
He seemed to fall asleep as shapeless waves slowly rippled out one
after another.
In that instant, Monster Bieber paused and the craziness in its eyes
quickly receded. Its thin transparent eyelids began to close
uncontrollably as well.
Dunn’s body started quivering, and something popped up under his
clothing and wriggled on the spot. It was as though he hid slippery
scaleless snakes within.
Lorotta rushed over and with a roll, arrived under Monster Bieber.
She supported herself with one hand while raising a clenched ﬁst,
bombarding Monster Bieber’s crotch like artillery.
Poof!
She ignored the corrosive pain but supported herself against the
ground and directed more strength once again. She went higher a
little as her ﬁst drilled deeper in.
Rip! Lorotta pulled out her forearm as she dragged out an intestine
ﬁlled with brownish-yellow blood stains.
In the intestine, there was an ancient notebook.
“Ah!”
Monster Bieber let out a blood-curdling scream, and his body
suddenly lit up as though it was melting.
“Get down!”
Just as Aiur Harson’s hurried shout ended, Klein saw Monster Bieber
suddenly swell up.
Boom!
Amid a loud explosion, the distant Klein was tossed into the air by
the shockwave and landed heavily.
He struggled to stand against a swirling headache, and he saw
Monster Bieber turn into a pile of disgusting, rotting ﬂesh. Then he
saw Dunn and Lorotta, who were a dozen meters away, looking like
they had been knocked out.
Aiur Harson, Borgia, and Leonard Mitchell were on the ground too.
Some groaning in pain, some struggling to stand up but failing.
Klein was just about to relax when he suddenly saw a familiar object
about two or three meters away from him.
The black chest had stopped rolling, and cracked surface was facing
the sky.
A skinny brown arm extended out.
Sealed Artifact… 2-049… F**k! Klein’s heart tensed up as he
immediately leaped in the opposite direction in a bid to escape
2-049’s eﬀective range.
The blast from before had thrown the black chest near him!
And at that moment, Klein’s head suddenly buzzed as his thoughts
turned sluggish.
Chapter 75: Saving himself
Oh no! I’ve been controlled by the puppet!
Captain and company are either unconscious… or have yet to recover.
They can’t even get up… They will not be able to… wake me up in time…
No… I have to… save myself!
Everything before Klein’s eyes was happening in slow motion. All his
joints and his brain seemed to have been coated with an ever-
thickening layer of glue.
He had no interest in becoming a human-version puppet, so he seized
the opportunity of not being fully controlled by trying his best to seek
a way to save himself.
I deﬁnitely can’t… hit myself… There must be an… external force…
External force… I’ll give it a try… There’s no time for hesitation…
Without the luxury of time to think through things, Klein came to an
idea in less than three seconds. He moved his “rusty” knee joint and
took a counterclockwise step.
At the same time, he did not try to escape the invisible rope that
“hung” around his throat. All he did was recite inwardly.
Blessings Stem… From The… Immortal Lord of… Heaven and Earth…
He wanted to use the mysterious world above the gray fog to awaken
him and escape Sealed Artifact 2-049’s assimilation!
Creak! Creak! Creak! Klein’s knees and ankles let out an involved ear-
piercing sound. With a slow contorted step, he took another step
counterclockwise.
Blessings Stem… From The Sky Lord… of Heaven and Earth.
Klein’s thoughts turned increasingly sluggish as he felt as though he
was a computer that had all sorts of bloatware and every antivirus
software installed. He lifted his left foot in a jerky manner as he took
another step in the required spot.
Blessings Stem… From The… Exalted Thearch…
Klein’s thought processes turned more and more rigid and sluggish.
He took the ﬁnal step purely out of instinct.
At that point, he knew he was almost fully under the puppet’s
control. Even if Aiur Harson could get up in time to save him, he
would probably be unable to be awakened.
But his strong desire to live made him chant the ﬁnal line of the
incantation.
Blessings… Stem… From The… Celestial… Worthy…
Just as he ﬁnished his incantation, the extremely chaotic and
hysterical shouts and murmurs sounded. They quickly took over
every corner of Klein’s sluggish thoughts, shattering them in the
process and reducing them to thoughts he had no control over.
Klein’s brain became a boiling pot of potpourri as his stiﬀ body
turned light while his spirituality lifted.
Endless grayish-white fog and the dark red stars of varying distances
appeared once again before his eyes. It was vast, mysterious, vague,
and blurry.
Klein’s confused mind quickly settled down as he ﬁnally regained his
ability to think, only to see the magniﬁcent palace.
“Phew… Thankfully, it worked.” he whispered with a lingering fear.
According to his previous observations, he knew that once someone
fell under the control of Sealed Artifact 2-049, it was equivalent to
death. Normally, there was no medicine that could save the victim.
Luckily, his luck enhancement ritual and the mysterious world above
the gray fog was not considered normal at all!
After pacing a few times, Klein began considering the situation he
was in.
I can’t just stay here the entire time, right?
By the time Captain and company wakes up and gather over, I won’t be
able to explain the situation…
As things are right now, I only have the shell of my body, nothing more
zombielike than a zombie…
But if I were to take the risk and return, there’s no way to guarantee my
safety… What if I get controlled by 2-049 again?
…
While suﬀering from his dilemma, Klein suddenly smacked himself in
the forehead and could not help but chuckle softly.
“It looks like I haven’t gotten used to my status as a Seer!”
Before he ﬁnished his sentence, he appeared at the seat of honor in
front of the long bronze table, sitting on the high-back chair with the
strange symbol.
Klein extended his hand as a fountain pen appeared out of thin air.
He scribbled a sentence on an illusory piece of paper.
“Returning to the real world is very safe.”
Immediately following that, Klein pulled out a projection of a spirit
pendulum from his packet. After a few Gatherings, he discovered that
the items he brought on him were projected above the gray fog, but
they were relatively illusory.
Klein held the silver chain with his left hand as he allowed the topaz
to nearly touch the paper.
He calmed his breathing and half closed his eyes. He calmly repeated
the words on the piece of paper.
“Returning to the real world is very safe.”
…
“Returning to the real world is very safe.”
…
After repeating it seven times, Klein completed the divination with
spirit dowsing.
He opened his eyes and saw the topaz slowly oscillating, guiding the
silver chain in a clockwise spin.
Clockwise is an aﬃrmation while counterclockwise is negative…
Returning to the real world is very safe… Klein heaved a sigh of relief as
he habitually stored the chain away. Then, he released his spirituality
and wrapped his body as he simulated a plummeting state.
The hazy fog and deep red stars turned ethereal and charged upward.
Klein soon saw himself still in a daze in his original position. He saw
the brown puppet, halfway out of the chest. He also noticed that the
Sealed Artifact had apparently stopped all motion.
His physical senses reached to his brain and just as he was about to
try to move his arm to determine his condition, he suddenly heard a
voice concealed within the wind.
“Do you wish to be awakened? You can be saved as long as you
promise me one thing.
“This one thing is to help me take that Antigonus family notebook.
“Nod if you agree. I know you are still capable of completing that
action.”
Who is it? Yes… 2-049 doesn’t seem like it’s attempting to control me…
That’s right. It will not repeatedly inﬂuence the same person. There will be
a break… Klein was shocked, but he did not show it on his face.
At that moment, the voice added quickly, “You can obtain additional
rewards if you complete this matter. I know you are a Seer. I also
know that the Church of the Evernight Goddess does not have
Sequence 8 that succeeds Sequence 9. But our Secret Order can give
it to you.
“Heh, to be honest, I was a Seer before. If not, I wouldn’t have dared
return. To show you my sincerity, I can now tell you that the
corresponding Sequence 8 of Seer is Clown.”
Clown? Secret Order… Klein nearly did not maintain his “puppet”
state.
He never made the connection between Seer and Clown.
Were they about to become the head honchos of a circus?
“Alright, make your choice. Believe me, you no longer have much
time left to waste.” The voice sounded with the wind again. The
distant Dunn and Lorotta were still unconscious. Borgia seemed
heavily injured as he moaned without moving. Aiur Harson and
Leonard Mitchell were in relatively good shape as they attempted to
sit up.
Why me? The Secret Order… Is it that suited clown from before? After he
escaped, he secretly returned in a bid to ﬁsh in troubled waters… Upon
hearing the voice, all sorts of doubts instantly ﬂashed through Klein’s
mind.
Since the person said that he was a Seer, Klein attempted using the
thought processes of a Seer to analyze the situation.
He dared return because he divined ‘hope.’ He believed that Monster
Bieber would be destroyed and that we would suﬀer a heavy setback.
He did not take the notebook by himself or deal with us directly because
he likely divined that it would contain immense risk. Therefore, he is
suspecting Captain and Madam Lorotta are feigning their unconsciousness,
or that this is a trap laid out for him.
He did not make further divinations to determine my present state
partially because ﬁrstly, he might not have the time. If he waited any
longer, Mr. Aiur Harson and company would have regained some of their
combat strength. Secondly, he belittles me and thinks it unnecessary.
He understands a Seer very well and is conﬁdent that I’m unable to escape
the puppet’s control… He is using me as cannon fodder to probe for any
traps…
From another angle, this also means that the luck enhancement ritual does
not cause any abnormal appearances…
With his brain no longer sluggish, Klein felt that his line of reasoning
was clear. He was quite conﬁdent of the thoughts and goals of the
suited clown.
As for the clown’s promise, he believed not one bit of it. Cannon
fodder did not have any human rights!
As the thoughts ﬂashed through his head, Klein controlled his neck
and diﬃculty nodded.
As he did this action, he conﬁrmed that he had escaped the control of
Sealed Artifact 2-049.
Just after he nodded, a transparent “curtain” stirred two to three
meters to his side. It revealed the suited clown who had his face
painted with a clown’s pastel colors. It was none other than the
Secret Order member who had ﬂed previously.
At that moment, as Klein had previously turned around in an attempt
to leap out of 2-049’s eﬀective range, his back was facing the black
chest and the puppet. The suited clown was in front of him to his
side. First, it was to stay away from the Sealed Artifact and second, to
avoid his revolver’s barrel. It was clear that he was very careful.
The suited clown pulled out a long paper slip from his pocket and
shook it vigorously until it turned straight like a wooden pole.
He held the wooden pole and at a distance of two to three meters, he
gave Klein’s shoulder a prod in an attempt to wake him.
This fellow knows 2-049 very well. He knows that if the scent of an
Antigonus family descendant is present, the puppet would go ballistic and
control two at a time… He also knows that throwing a rock doesn’t seem
eﬀective. At the very least, I’ve seen Captain and company attempt similar
means… Although Klein did not know why 2-049 had stopped
assimilating him again, he did not dare stay within ﬁve meters of it
any longer. Therefore, he waited as he held his breath.
Just as the wooden pole was about to touch his shoulder, Klein
suddenly raised his left hand and grabbed the edge of the pole and
yanked it backwards.
The suited clown was caught by surprise as his body was pulled
forward. He staggered a few steps forward as the gap between him
and Klein contracted once again. He was now less than two meters
away.
At the same time, the prepared Klein squeezed his right ﬁnger on the
revolver’s trigger.
Bang! Bang!
He shot twice but did not aim at the suited clown. Instead, he had
aimed behind him, shooting to the side of Sealed Artifact 2-049!
Before the gunshot rang, the suited clown had taken the initiative to
roll from his staggering state. He had instinctively backed oﬀ.
Klein released his hand which had grabbed the wooden pole as he
took several steps away rapidly and rushed out the danger zone.
Just as the suited clown rolled twice and was about to jump
backwards, his head went abuzz as his thoughts rapidly turned
sluggish.
No good!
He forced me to… dodge in the direction of the Antigonus puppet!
I’m within… ﬁve meters…
How could he… not be… controlled by… the Antigonus… puppet…
…
The suited clown stopped from his rolling as he attempted to crawl
out with his seemingly rusty joints.
At that moment, Klein had already turned around. He held his
revolver with both hands as he aimed at the slowly-moving target.
To him, that was equivalent to shooting a ﬁxed target.
Having seen the suited clown’s battle with Dunn, Aiur, and Lorotta,
Klein knew that he was agile and good at rolling. Therefore, even
when they were just a meter or two apart, he had carefully given up
on shooting directly. Instead, he forced the clown to dodge to the
“kill zone” he imagined—where Sealed Artifact 2-049 was!
If the puppet had been ineﬀective, the suited clown would have
determined that he had fallen into a trap. He would then escape by
leaping backwards and not pose any signiﬁcant threat.
Bang!
Reﬂected into the indescribable eyes of the suited clown, the black-
suited Klein pulled the trigger calmly.
Chapter 76: Dealing With The
Aftermath
Bang!
The silver bullet traversed the short distance of a few meters and
accurately bore into the suited clown’s neck. Large amounts of blood
spewed out, dyeing his skin and bow tie red.
The suited clown was unable to let out a cry as his throat seemed to
produce sounds of him gasping for breath. He wished to raise his arm
to divert the fatal wound, but his joints appeared to be ﬁlled with
glue. His motions were slow and jerky.
Bang!
Having entered a half-Cogitation state, Klein was not stunned by the
appearance of blood. He pulled the trigger once again calmly, as
though it was his usual daily practice.
A grisly hole appeared on the suited clown’s forehead as crimson red
spewed out. The luster in his eyes dimmed as the intricate revolver’s
might was far higher than what Klein had imagined to be.
As his knees buckled and his arms hung down, the suited clown
gradually fell to the ground. His eyes were frozen with a dazed look.
His body convulsed a few times before it slowly relaxed and stopped
moving.
Having delivered a headshot, Klein turned around in a cool manner.
He spun his revolver and allowed the empty shells to fall down.
Then, dressed in his black formal suit and halved top hat, he walked
towards Aiur Harson. He pulled out the ﬁnal silver demon hunting
bullet in his pocket and inserted it into the revolver’s chamber.
The reason why he did not turn back to look at the suited clown’s
tragic fate was solely because of his discomfort with his ﬁrst kill.
However, it was necessary. He did not know what would happen if
the suited clown was under the full control of the puppet.
Furthermore, he did not dare risk entering Sealed Artifact 2-049’s
eﬀective range. After all, no one knew if something odd would
happen that prevented his self-rescuing luck enhancement ritual to
fail.
As for the items on the suited clown, Klein only cared if there was the
so-called Clown potion formula or the relevant clues. However, this
was not something he was in a hurry to carry out. In a while, he
could do it together with Dunn, Aiur, and company. If the
Nighthawks had it, it also practically meant that he had it. There was
no way that they would be unwilling to share the potion formula of
Sequence 8. At most, he would be required to accumulate his
contributions over time. After all, he had only become a Seer
recently; it would still be a long time until he fully digested it.
As his thoughts churned, Klein quickly walked next to Aiur Harson.
The gentleman in his gray windbreaker struggled to sit up but failed
at every try. He was covered in dust and mud from the fall.
“Mr. Harson, what do you need me to do?” he asked, squatting down.
He pointed the revolver in his hand at the ground in case of a misﬁre.
Aiur gasped for air and sighed.
“The monster was too strong; if not for its weakness…”
Then, he pointed at a sky-blue metal bottle beside him and said in a
self-deprecating laugh, “I was trying to consume some medicine, but
my hand shook…”
The sky-blue bottle was about the size of Klein’s ﬁnger. It was not
longer than ﬁve centimeters long and a cap that hid spiral patterns
had fallen to the side. The liquid had completely spilled.
Klein reached out to pick up the bottle. As he looked at it with
narrowed eyes, he answered helplessly, “Mr. Harson, there are only a
few drops left in the bottle.”
“Go to… Borgia and search his body. In his inner pockets.” Aiur said
as he gasped for breath.
“Alright.” Klein stood up and casually asked, “Is this restorative
medicine?”
An item from mysticism?
“No, it only has certain restorative eﬀects. The main goal is to
stimulate our minds and squeeze out the potential… of our bodies. It
allows to maintain a decent state for a short period of time until we
return, where we can receive treatment.” Aiur attempted to sit up
only to fail again. “It’s name is the Goddess’s Gaze… Remember to let
Borgia drink half a bottle.”
Klein did not delay any further as he turned around. He briskly
arrived at Borgia who was groaning in pain. He found the uniform
sky-blue metal bottle from the Nighthawk’s pocket.
After removing the cap, he carefully held the bottle to Borgia’s
mouth.
Having sensed it, Borgia tried hard to open his lips.
The bottle was held up as dark red liquid ﬂowed in Borgia’s mouth.
Klein estimated the quantity and stopped just in time. He then
screwed the cap back on.
The medicine was rather eﬀective. It only took Borgia a few seconds
after drinking to regain the spirit in his eyes. Furthermore, he
whispered, “Thank you.”
With that said, he pressed down on the ground as he slowly sat up.
He ﬁrst dealt with his wounds before walking to the unconscious
Lorotta and Dunn. Then, he retrieved the Goddess’s Gaze from the
latter’s inner pocket.
Klein returned to Aiur’s side and fed him the remaining half bottle.
After Aiur panted a few times, his actions suddenly became nimbler.
He stood up as though he had never been injured.
“I’ll help Borgia. Help that partner of yours.” The gentleman with the
charm of a middle-aged man pointed at Leonard Mitchell.
Klein had no objections to it. He turned around and jogged to the
“poet,” Leonard.
“There’s no need. I can drink it by myself.” Leonard, with his
disheveled hair, smiled as he raised the sky-blue bottle.
Upon seeing Leonard agilely get up by pushing up with one hand,
Klein, who wanted to lampoon, was suddenly stunned.
Leonard’s injuries are lighter than I expected…
He had the ability to consume the medicine from the very beginning!
That also means that he could see me walk counterclockwise as I did the
luck enhancement ritual!
No, that’s still alright. I had chanted inwardly and the luck enhancement
ritual does not appear odd in any way, or the suited clown would not have
fallen for it…
But even so, Leonard, who had long recovered but chose to watch by the
sidelines, had seen quite a lot. Things like me not being aﬀected by 2-049
and my sneak attack on the suited clown…
Just as Klein’s eyes narrowed slightly, Leonard, who was walking in
his direction, stopped beside him and chuckled softly.
“I actually wanted to save you but discovered that you didn’t need it.
“Don’t mind it. There are many special people in this world that can
always do things others can’t, such as you…”
“…and me.” Leonard smiled as he went past Klein and walked to the
awakening Dunn and Lorotta.
Narcissist… Klein thought silently as he felt a lot more relaxed.
From the looks of it, Leonard Mitchell hid quite a bit of secrets… As
he regrouped with the rest while deep in thought, he saw Captain
Dunn wear a cloth and pick up the Antigonus family notebook that
was covered in yellowish-brown blood stains.
The notebook’s cover was completely made of thick black paper. It
suﬀused an aura from an ancient and distant time without any signs
of softening or rotting. It was nearly identical to the one he saw in his
dream. He even suspected that ﬂipping it open would only make him
see the Fool wearing splendid headgear.
However, he soon realized that he was overthinking things since
Dunn had ﬂipped open the notebook to make a ﬁnal conﬁrmation.
Klein was unable to discern the words on it due to his poor angle, but
he was certain that there was no drawing of the Fool with his
gorgeous clothes and splendid headdress.
“Ahem. There’s nothing wrong with it.” Dunn closed the notebook
and held it securely. Then, he looked at Aiur and company. “Let’s
store this notebook and Sealed Artifact 2-049 behind Tingen’s Chanis
Gate. We can wait until all of you are recovered or Backlund sends
someone over.”
Upon hearing that, Klein felt a little disappointed once again, but also
felt happy. He wished to see the Antigonus family’s notebook once
more and ﬁgure out the reason for the death of the original Klein,
Welch, and Naya. However, he also felt that the ancient item was
ﬁlled with misfortune. It often brought catastrophe, so he did not
dare touch it.
Handing it to the Church’s headquarters and sealing it is considered the
best choice…He secretly heaved a sigh of relief.
“Alright.” Aiur Harson, Borgia, and Lorotta nodded in unison. They
then turned around and arrived beside Sealed Artifact 2-049.
They woke each other up and stuﬀed the puppet which had resumed
moving into the black chest with an opening as they monitored it
strictly.
“Everything is back to normal.” Aiur sounded a little more relaxed.
Inside the dimly lit black chest, the puppet wrapped in oil-stained
cloth ﬂipped over with its body creaking as it aligned its clown-
painted face with the light source.
On the creepy face, under the black pupil-less eyes, two hardly
noticeable crimson cracks appeared.
Meanwhile, Dunn, Leonard, and Klein, who had mustered his
courage, began searching the suited clown’s corpse. They found paper
ﬂowers, handkerchiefs, poker cards, glass pieces, and all sorts of
strange items.
However, apart from that, he did not seem to carry anything of worth
or potential clues.
Hmm, other than the wallet with seventy to eighty pounds and ten plus
soli… Klein secretly sighed.
With money in mind, he immediately looked down and inspected
himself. His face nearly fell literally.
His formal suit that cost several pounds had torn in ﬁve to six spots
which required mending due to his rolling on the ground.
Furthermore, it was covered in dust and dirt stains.
Dunn shot him a glance as the corner of his lips curved up.
“Losses during a mission can be reimbursed.”
Reimbursed… Upon hearing the term “invented” by Emperor Roselle,
Klein instantly felt wonderful.
Yeah. This suit just needs some proper cleaning and mending before it can
be worn again. It will still be presentable…
When the reimbursement comes, I can buy another set and I can take
turns wearing them!
Hmm, I am not the kind of person that uses a reimbursement for
something other than what it was intended for…
However, I should consider getting a set of clothes for combat in the
future, such as a black windbreaker like Captain… Clothes with slightly
poorer material would be much cheaper than a tuxedo… Tsk, has the
reason why the bastard, Leonard, doesn’t like wearing formal suits been
due to him having such considerations…
“Let Frye take care of the dead body. We’ll see if he can ﬁnd what the
man originally looked like or ﬁnd any relevant clues.” Dunn touched
the suited clown’s face paint with his gloves.
Then, they searched the innermost warehouse and saw that there
were a splotches of bloody ﬂesh that looked like they had been
smashed by boulders. They also saw one white bone after another
that had been strewn everywhere.
“Ray Bieber was absorbing the power in the notebook via an ancient
ritual, just like how we would consume a higher-level Sequence
potion. A ritual like that is full of danger. It must be performed in an
environment isolated from all disturbances, and the ritual would
have required him to enter a deep sleep for a certain amount of time.
That was probably why he had yet to leave Tingen.” Dunn guessed at
the possibilities after inspecting the warehouse.
Upon hearing such a description, Lorotta laughed. Her black hair
contrasted sharply with her pale face.
“Such a pity, we awakened him ahead of time. His anger at being
woken up truly left a deep impression on us.”
“This is a kind of losing control,” Dunn looked towards Klein and told
him, as both an explanation and a lecture.
“Why didn’t he just leave Tingen and try to absorb it elsewhere?”
asked a perplexed Klein.
Aiur laughed and pointed to his head.
“People inﬂuenced by ancient or sinister powers often are lacking in
this department.”
At that moment, Dunn inhaled and said while hiding his pain,
“Leonard, you are still in good condition. Stay here and do not allow
ordinary people to come close… The rest of us will immediately
search for items among Ray Bieber’s remains. We will return with
them and the Sealed Artifact, as well as the Antigonus family’s
notebook. We will then get Frye, Royale, and the police to come
here.”
Chapter 77: Remnant Items
“Alright,” answered Leonard with a relaxed expression when he
heard Dunn’s suggestion.
Following that, everyone walked out of the warehouse and came
close to where Monster Bieber had “self-destructed.” With him at the
origin, they began searching outwards radially.
“Captain, what are we looking for?” Klein looked at the rotting ﬂesh
and blood that was strewn everywhere. He held back his urge to
retch as he looked at Dunn Smith beside him ponderingly.
Dunn did not look up. Instead, he used his deep gray eyes to sweep
the ground.
“Awakening ahead of time, losing control, and becoming a monster.
This means that Ray Bieber did not fully absorb the Beyonder powers
provided by the notebook. It also means that a part of his body is
considered extraordinary, making it prime material.”
“If you ever encounter something similar, make sure not to miss out
on doing a search. It might be a relatively important item.”
So that’s the case… Klein nodded slightly in enlightenment.
In the blink of an eye, he thought of another matter.
If the part where Monster Bieber had concentrated the Beyonder powers
were some indescribable part, wouldn’t that be awkward… Wouldn’t it be
extremely disgusting to concoct it into a potion…
Just as Klein’s mind wandered, Borgia with his sharp eagle-like eyes
suddenly shouted.
“Found it. Ahem.”
Dunn and company immediately turned and closed in. Driven by his
curiosity, Klein walked over to Borgia with a quickened pace.
Soon, he saw the item before Borgia. It was a grayish-white item
about the size of a ﬁst. Its surface was ﬁlled with gullies and it looked
soft but ductile. It looked like a brain that had been extracted out of a
living being.
Although Klein was unable to make out the extraordinariness of the
blob of grayish-white, he was certain that Borgia had not made a
mistake since it had remained intact despite the violent explosion it
had undergone.
Dunn carefully observed it and squatted down. As he extended and
bent his right arm, he used his black-gloved left hand to carefully
grab the grayish-white item.
The moment it was touched, the blob of grayish-white immediately
spread out into an extremely sticky liquid.
At that moment, Aiur Harson took out a tin-colored square case,
removed the cigarettes from them and placed them into his pocket.
Then, he handed the square case to Dunn and smiled.
“I know, you only like pipes.”
Dunn chuckled and took the square case. Then, he “poured” the
grayish-white sticky liquid into the case for temporary storage.
After storing it away, everyone did a cursory sweep of the area.
After conﬁrming that they had not missed out anything, they left.
When they came out, they saw the horses digging their hooves into
the ground, clearly spooked and nervous. They had nearly escaped
their reins.
“I’ll drive.” Borgia covered his mouth with his hand and coughed
softly.
“I know you are good at placating animals,” said Aiur with a smiling
nod.
After boarding the carriage, Dunn, Lorotta, Aiur Harson, and Klein,
who continued their “arm exercises,” temporarily had nothing to say
as they fell into silence.
When the trotting of the horses sounded while the carriage wheeled
oﬀ, Dunn looked at Klein and deliberated over his words before
saying, “I know you are ﬁlled with curiosity about the Antigonus
family’s notebook. You wish to understand what happened.”
No, not at all… Klein subconsciously denied.
It was an ancient relic ﬁlled with misfortune!
Without giving him time to answer, Dunn continued and said,
“However, I have to ﬁrst report this to the Holy Cathedral. Only after
they determine the conﬁdentiality level of the notebook can we
consider if this can be shown to you.”
“No problem.” Klein gave a short and simple reply.
Dunn continued his arm exercises as he thought before saying, “I
once promised that you can be made a formal member of the
Nighthawks when we conﬁrm that Ray Bieber is a descendant of the
Antigonus family clan. Now, not only have we determined Ray
Bieber’s identity, we have even eliminated the monster and spoiled
the Secret Order’s conspiracy.
“In this entire process, your performance was outstanding. You
personally killed a member of an evil organization. Therefore, I will
fulﬁll my promise and immediately make an application to the Holy
Cathedral. We’ll wait for their approval.
“Right, I forgot something important. I still need to ask if you are
agreeable to it.
“Mr Klein Moretti, are you willing to formally join the Tingen
Nighthawks as one of its members? Your salary will increase
severalfold, reaching six pounds a week. Furthermore, you will get a
raise every subsequent year.
“Your salary will be paid by the Church and Awwa County’s Police
Department equally. You will also gain the identity of a probationary
inspector. It will be very useful at times.
“As a support-type Beyonder, you do not always need to face
enemies, but you will have to guard Chanis Gate once a week…
“Without the squad’s permission, you are not to leave Tingen without
permission. Furthermore, you have to keep this a secret from your
family…”
…
By the time Dunn ﬁnished listing the restrictions and beneﬁts, Klein
was already thinking deeply for more than ten seconds.
“I wish to become a formal Nighthawk.”
Only by doing so could he continue to gain more access to mystery,
such as the situation regarding the Secret Order!
After reading the gathered Roselle diaries, Klein had some changes in
thoughts about himself. “Being skilled in mysticism knowledge to
seek a way home was an immutable goal of his. Raising his strength
further to more safely make the mysterious space above the gray fog
do his bidding before using it to return home was a new addition to
his goals.
Just as Emperor Roselle said, simply relying on external powers was
very dangerous!
Furthermore, after becoming a Seer and obtaining Beyonder powers,
Klein sensed that he had a better grasp of the mysterious space. For
example, he could pull another person into the Gathering.
This forced him to consider what possibly beneﬁcial changes would
happen to the mysterious space above the gray fog when he reached
Sequence 8, Sequence 7, or an even higher Sequence.
Of course, Klein knew very well that this was built on the premise
that he completely resolved the side eﬀects of the Seer potion. He
could not rush or be rash.
“Very well. Once the Holy Cathedral approves of it, you will become
one of us.” Dunn’s gray eyes were tinted with a hint of joy.
At that moment, Aiur Harson, who was listening in, interrupted.
“Klein, don’t mind me calling you Klein. Your performance today was
really excellent. You managed to kill a Beyonder from the Secret
Order. I even suspect that he has reached Sequence 7. How did you
do it? I really ﬁnd it incredulous.”
The question has ﬁnally been raised… Having long prepared for it,
Klein acted as though he was organizing his thoughts.
He knew that it was indeed incredible and enigmatic that he had
killed a Beyonder that ran rings around Dunn, Aiur, and Lorotta. Aiur
and company were not blind or dumb, so it was a matter of time
before they inquired about the process. However, he never expected
them to wait till this moment.
That’s right. Captain and Mr. Harson were previously injured and their
situations could have worsened at any time. At that moment, any matter
that could result in conﬂict had to be put on hold. It was to prevent me
from acting desperately because of my exposed “secret.” Only after I
expressed my attitude and showed that I was willing to be a Nighthawk
were they at ease enough to ask… How crafty. They did not have any
obvious communication between themselves, but they had made the same
tacit decision…
Klein answered as though in thought, “It’s an extremely lucky event.
The clown in the tuxedo had made a fatal misjudgment.
“Back then, Sealed Artifact 2-049 was thrown near me as a result of
the explosion’s blast. It looked about ﬁve to six meters from me, but
it was only a crude observation. It was very easy to come to the
conclusion that I was within the Sealed Artifact’s area of inﬂuence.
“And back then, I was feeling faint because of the explosion. My
actions turned sluggish and looked as though I was being controlled.
“It was unknown when that suited clown came close to me in an
invisible state. He tried to entice me by oﬀering to save me and the
corresponding Sequence 8, Clown, of the Seer potion. He wanted me
to help him retrieve the Antigonus family’s notebook. Right, he said
that the Secret Order is in control of the Seer potion’s corresponding
Sequence pathway and that he was once a Seer.”
…
Klein recounted the situation back then in detail. He even described
the theories he had back then, including how he believed that the
suited clown had divined that taking the notebook would be an
extremely risky endeavor; thus, he had changed his plans.
Of course, all the truths were used to conceal the lie made in the
beginning—that he had been controlled by Sealed Artifact 2-049.
“Divined that it was extremely risky to retrieve the notebook? Yes,
it’s indeed highly risky. However, the risk was actually because of
you,” said Lorotta with a chuckle as she covered her mouth. “His
divination was right, but it caused him to end up in a fatal situation.
This sure is an interesting account.”
Klein was taken aback before he nodded seriously.
“Indeed. Divination is never crystal clear. And that vagueness only
means that an interpretation can be wrong.”
Yes, I have to take note of that!
“How did you ﬁnish him oﬀ after that?” asked Dunn while he did his
arm exercises and leaned back.
Klein smiled.
“I pretended to agree to him and made him awaken me. However, he
did not dare enter the eﬀective range of the Sealed Artifact. He
stayed two to three meters away and used a strange paper slip in an
attempt to push me.
“I seized the opportunity and pulled at his paper slip, causing him to
be thrown into 2-049’s eﬀective range. I then complemented it with
repeated shots and completed my goal. Heh, it’s quite an
embarrassing matter for me. I didn’t even have the conﬁdence of
hitting him despite being only two to three meters away from him.”
Aiur nodded slightly.
“With his evasive abilities, a distance of two to three meters is not an
absolute guarantee. You might be able to strike him but fail to hit
him in a vital spot. That would only make things worse… Your
choice back then was impeccable. It can even be said to be
outstanding. If I were in your shoes, I might not have been able to do
it better than you.”
He did not ask further. After all, the suited clown’s entry into the
Sealed Artifact 2-049’s area of inﬂuence basically sealed his fate. He
became a living target.
“The subsequent Sequence of Seer is Clown… How odd…” Dunn
suddenly said with a sigh.
Chapter 78: Trauma
Aiur Harson added, “Exactly, it is hard to imagine that the
subsequent Sequence of Seer would be Clown. According to normal
logic, no one would link them together.”
“Is that strange? I remember that quite a number of Sequence potions
also seem to lack similarities between their diﬀerent levels.” Lorotta
covered her mouth as she yawned. It was obvious that her injuries
were more severe. Not even Goddess’s Gaze could help her to
maintain her vibrant energy.
“No, Lorotta. This is completely diﬀerent. Even if the other Sequence
potions are lacking a connection, we can also ﬁnd common points if
viewed from a diﬀerent angle. However, I cannot comprehend it for
Seer and Clown at all,” said Aiur Harson as he shook his head and
sighed.
Klein listened to their discussion and laughed.
“No, there’s still a common point.”
“What?” Aiur asked curiously. Even Dunn’s arm exercises clearly
slowed down.
Klein replied without hesitation, “Be it a Seer or a Clown, both of
them can be found at the circus.”
“…” Aiur, Dunn, and Lorotta were stunned.
“Pﬀt… Quite a good answer. I like young man like you!” Lorotta was
the ﬁrst to return to her senses as she burst out laughing.
Aiur also smiled as he shook his head.
“In this era, the number of gentlemen who are equipped with the
spirit of self-deprecation is decreasing. Thankfully, we have met one
today.”
Do you think I like to engage in self-deprecation… It’s not like I ﬁgured
out any commonality between the two… Klein complained internally as
he replied with a wry smile, “I only wish that the potions of the
Sequence pathway would not have names like Beast Tamer, Acrobat,
or Magician. That would really form a circus.”
Furthermore, it’s a one-man circus…
“Haha.” Dunn and company were immediately amused. It ﬁlled the
carriage with a joyous atmosphere.
The carriage proceeded straight for Zouteland Street. Klein, who was
not injured, was the ﬁrst to enter Blackthorn Security Company.
“Goddess! What happened to you? Why are you like that?” Rozanne
exclaimed when she caught sight of him.
Klein looked down at his dirty and tattered suit. He replied with his
heart aching, “There are always all kinds of accidents during a
mission. Thankfully, the Goddess blessed us and it ended beautifully.”
“Praise the Lady!” Rozanne devoutly drew the crimson moon across
her chest.
Before waiting for Klein to continue, she asked, “Do you need us to
hide in the third ﬂoor again? Is the Sealed Artifact really that
dangerous?”
“Trust me. It’s far more dangerous than you can imagine,” replied
Klein with a lingering fear.
If not for his even more mysterious luck enhancement ritual, he
would have perished under the proverbial hands of 2-049!
“Goddess…” Rozanne’s lips quivered as though she had still a million
things to say or questions to ask, but in consideration of how the
captain was waiting downstairs, she held back her compulsion. She
informed Mrs. Orianna and company to head upstairs to the third
ﬂoor. The neighbors of Blackthorn Security Company were either
estates of the Church, or devout clergymen who vaguely knew of the
situation.
When all the civilian staﬀ dispersed, Klein did not rush to the
entertainment room to inform the other Nighthawks. He immediately
returned and helped the captain and the rest escort Sealed Artifact
2-049, Monster Bieber’s remnants, and the Antigonus family’s
notebook to the second ﬂoor.
Through the partition, Dunn pushed open the entertainment room’s
door and said to the two Nighthawks who were playing Gwent cards,
“Frye, Royale, both of you are to immediately head to the harbor’s
Tyrell Warehouse and aid Leonard in dealing with the aftermath.”
“Alright.” Royale with her raven-black hair and cold expression was
the ﬁrst to stand up.
Corpse Collector Frye, with his black hair, blue eyes, and pale skin
stood up next.
They put down their Gwent cards and walked out the entertainment
room and when they passed through the partition, they clearly
paused.
“Wait,” Dunn shouted, not letting down their expectations.
“What else is there?” Sleepless Royale turned her head back and
asked without an expression.
“Remember to inform the police. Let them seal oﬀ the road. Prevent
anyone from coming close until you are done with the scene and
move the corpse back,” Dunn said, smacking his forehead.
“Alright.” Royale turned around and took two steps before pausing
once again.
She turned her head, blinked and conﬁrmed coldly, “Captain, is there
nothing else?”
“No,” Dunn answered categorically.
Royale nodded unnoticeably and walked towards the entrance.
As for Corpse Collector Frye who exuded coldness and darkness, he
maintained his adequate pace.
At that moment, Dunn added, “Remember to tell Rozanna, Mrs.
Orianna, and company that they can come down.”
“No problem.” Frye calmly replied as though no emotions stirred in
him.
Klein watched as the two Nighthawks walked out the door and went
upstairs before heaving a secret sigh of relief. He followed the captain
and the rest underground. They proceeded straight to Chanis Gate.
As Dunn gestured for Sleepless Kenley to open Chanis Gate, he
instructed Klein, “Go to the armory and get Old Neil here. We need
his ritualistic magic to heal ourselves.”
As the eﬀects of the medicine began to wear oﬀ, his mental state
gradually waned.
“Alright.” Klein did not wait for the captain to continue, as he added,
“I will watch the armory in Old Neil’s place. I will also request for at
least twenty demon hunting bullets and also wait for the Holy
Cathedral’s approval, curbing my curiosity about the Antigonus
family’s notebook.”
“…” Dunn was instantly at a loss for words.
“Captain, is there anything else?” asked Klein with a smile after
beating Dunn to it.
Dunn shook his head and remained speechless.
He pulled out his cane and turned around. After walking a certain
distance, Klein turned into the armory and recounted the happenings
generally to Old Neil who was drinking plain water.
“He became a monster that lost control… You even killed a
Beyonder?” Old Neil quickly tidied up his desk. “It’s like I’m listening
to the script of a play.”
He mumbled as he circled around the desk and walked straight
towards the corridor without waiting for Klein’s answer.
Klein asked out of curiosity, “Mr. Neil, doesn’t the Church have real
restorative medicine? Why would ritualistic magic be needed?”
“No medicine made with ordinary ingredients can provide the
permanent restorative eﬀects of a ritual. Extraordinary ingredients
are very rare, and most of them are not suitable for restorative
medicine,” Old Neil explained casually. “You should know about
Goddess’s Gaze, right? When the medicine is ﬁrst made via a ritual, it
would be a standard, real restorative medicine. But every minute
after its completion, its eﬀect evaporates until little of its eﬃcacy is
left.”
“I see…” Klein nodded disappointedly.
As a former “keyboard warrior” and avid gamer, it was a habit to
yearn for a medicine with magical healing properties.
He watched Old Neil leave and sat down, taking in the tranquility
that he had not had in a very long time.
In the midst of his peace, he recalled the tragic death of the suited
clown. He recalled himself shooting coldly, the gruesome wound and
the spewing of fresh blood.
Klein’s body shivered as he felt discomfort. He ﬁrst stood up, then sat
down, then slowly repeated the process. He also did some pacing
back and forth in between.
Phew… He let out a breath and decided to occupy himself with
something so that he could stop thinking of those negative images.
Klein took oﬀ his silk hat and formal suit. He then took out a
handkerchief and a brush to clean oﬀ the dirt and mud.
After an uncertain amount of time, he heard Old Neil’s familiar
footsteps. Old Neil’s gait involved him walking on his heels, and it
made a distinctive noise as he ambled down the hall.
“How tiring…” Old Neil complained as he walked into the room.
“Tell the rest that no one is to come here within the next hour. I need
to rest,” he instructed casually, glancing towards Klein.
“Why don’t you rest upstairs, and I keep watch here?” Klein
suggested out of kindness.
Old Neil shook his head.
“It’s too noisy upstairs. Rozanne is a lady who just can’t stop talking.”
“Alright.” Klein did not insist. He put on his coat and hat, picked up
his cane, and returned to the corridor. Then, he pulled the armory’s
door ajar.
Tap. Tap. Tap. He slowly walked on the empty path when he
suddenly saw many rooms he had never seen previously by the side.
“There is a secret door here…” Klein stopped at a spot around a bend
as he looked at the room.
He discovered that Corpse Collector Frye had already returned. He
was carefully examining a completely dissected corpse.
Corpse? Klein’s heart stirred as he mustered his courage and
approached the room. He knocked lightly on the opened door.
Knock! Knock! Knock!
Frye stopped his actions and turned around, looking over with his
blue but ice-cold eyes.
“Sorry for disturbing you. I just wish to know if this is a corpse of a
Beyonder,” asked Klein as he controlled his tone.
“Yes.” Frye’s lips opened and closed, but only spat out a single word.
Klein’s gaze reached beyond him and landed on the corpse. Indeed,
he discovered the familiar gruesome wound on the forehead.
It’s that suited clown… Klein secretly exhaled and said, “Any
discoveries?”
“No,” answered Frye in an abnormally simple manner.
The mood instantly turned awkward. Just as Klein was about to bade
farewell, Frye took the initiative to say, “If you feel uncomfortable,
you can come in to take a look. You will discover that it’s only a
corpse.”
Afraid that I’ll be traumatized? Klein nodded in thought.
“Alright.”
He entered the room and came in front of the long white-clothed
table as he looked at the corpse.
The suited clown’s red, yellow, and white paint had been cleaned oﬀ,
revealing an unfamiliar face that did not look anything special. He
was in his thirties and had black hair and a high nose bridge.
At that moment, Frye went to a square table by the corner of the wall
and picked up a pencil and piece of paper.
He returned to the corpse and placed the paper down and began
drawing with the pencil.
Klein glanced at it in curiosity and found that Frye was sketching the
suited clown’s head.
It did not take long before Frye stopped moving the pencil. On the
piece of paper, there was a lifelike portrait. Compared to the corpse,
the only diﬀerence was the lack of a wound with the addition of blue
eyes.
What a talented genius… Klein marveled in surprise.
“I never expected you to be that good at sketching.”
“My dream was to become an artist before becoming a Nighthawk.”
Frye’s tone was completely placid.
“Then why don’t you fulﬁll your dreams?” asked Klein curiously.
Frye put down his pencil and said with the suited clown’s portrait in
hand, “My father was a priest of the Goddess. He wished that I
become a priest. It’s a presentable job.”
“You became a priest?” Klein asked in surprise.
He found it unimaginable that Frye could become a priest with his
personality and the vibes he exuded.
“Yeah, I did quite an okay job.” Frye wore a cold expression as the
corners of his mouth curled up a little as he replied. “Later, I
encountered and experienced some things and ended up a
Nighthawk.”
Klein did not plan on infringing on his privacy, so he asked, “You
were once a priest of the Goddess, so why not choose to be a
Sleepless?”
“A personal reason,” answered Frye frankly. “Furthermore, Madam
Daly is a good role model.”
Klein nodded and just as he was about to change the subject, he
heard Frye say, “Help me watch this room. I have to immediately
hand the sketch to Captain… Closing a secret door is very
troublesome.”
“Alright.” Although Klein was a little afraid facing a corpse alone, he
braved his fear in agreement.
With Frye gone, the room turned quiet. The corpse laid there as
Klein’s heart turned heavy.
He took a few breaths and, in a bid to defeat his fears, approached
the long table.
The suited clown lay there silently with his pale face. His eyes were
tightly shut, and he had lost all signs of breathing. Apart from the
gruesome wound, he emitted the unique coldness of a dead man.
Klein observed for a moment as his emotions gradually settled as he
was calming down.
He swept his gaze and discovered a strange brand on the suited
clown’s wrist. Gathering his courage, he extended his hand to touch
it, hoping to turn it around to see it more clearly.
Just as the ice-cold touch reached from Klein’s ﬁngertips to his brain,
the pale palm that had lost all vibrancy shot up suddenly, grabbing
him by the wrist.
It grabbed at his wrist tightly!
Chapter 79: Another Murmuring
Klein instantly felt his hair stand on end as the icy hand tightened
around his wrist. He instinctively pulled his wrist back in a desperate
attempt to escape.
A heavy sensation bore down on him as Klein used every ﬁber of
strength in his entire body to yank his arm back.
Bam!
The pale, naked corpse was yanked so forcefully to the side that it fell
from the autopsy table.
However, the white, ice-cold ﬁngers’ grip remained ﬁrmly latched
onto Klein’s wrist.
Klein momentarily lost the ability to think; the only thought that
went through his mind was to draw his revolver and riddle the corpse
in holes.
However, as he could not retract his dominant hand, he threw his
black cane and desperately tried to retrieve his revolver from his
holster to no avail.
At that moment, the corpse’s eyes rose, revealing a pair of calm, blue
eyes.
His mouth moved as he muttered, “Hornacis… Hornacis…
Hornacis…”
After those three words were said, Klein was completely ﬂustered as
he felt that the ﬁngers gripping onto his wrist began to loosen before
dropping limp.
The suited clown’s eyes were shut once again, as though nothing had
happened at all.
If the pale corpse wasn’t lying on the stone ﬂoor, Klein would have
imagined that he had been struck by a hallucination spell.
He staggered backwards a few steps and felt that most of his body
was trembling as a result of the shock and fear.
Phew… Phew… Klein gasped for air as he slowly regained control of
his mental facilities. He looked at the corpse on the ground in alarm
and fear.
He drew his revolver and carefully retreated from the room, one step
at a time. After conﬁrming that the corpse was motionless, he took a
glance at his wrist of the hand holding onto his revolver.
There were ﬁve deep, red ﬁnger marks imprinted on his wrist. They
silently described his encounter.
Klein calmed down as vulgarities ﬁlled his mind.
F*cking hell. I almost died from the shock!
After panting for more than ten seconds, he began assembling items
in his mind to quickly compose himself.
He carefully recalled everything that he encountered and pieced them
together.
Although he did not understand the reason for the suited clown’s
“resurrection,” he acutely noticed an important point. The corpse had
repeated the words “Hornacis!”
“It’s Hornacis again…” Klein knitted his brows. “The Antigonus
family’s notebook has records of a Nation of the Evernight in the
Hornacis mountain range. While in Cogitation or Spirit Vision, I
would hear sounds that I shouldn’t be able to hear, and among those
sounds is the word ‘Hornacis’… Is the answer to all these questions
on the Hornacis mountain range?… There might be massive danger
lurking there. For example, an evil god might be sealed within and
was using various forms of ‘attraction’ to achieve freedom.”
While considering this, Klein carefully entered the room and touched
the corpse a few times to verify that it was completely dead.
He didn’t want Corpse Collector Frye to see him mess up the place, so
he mustered his courage to move the corpse back onto the autopsy
table.
Klein couldn’t help but feel as though his heart was in his mouth
throughout the process. The slightest movement could snap his tense
nerves. Furthermore, the ice-cold feeling given out by the corpse felt
particularly disgusting.
After ﬁnishing the mission with great diﬃculty, he recalled the
reason he approached the corpse. Therefore, he focused on the suited
clown’s wrist and looked at the strange brand.
It was unknown when the brand had slipped oﬀ, shrinking into a
spherical blob of blood which had tint of blue.
The spherical blob of blood was the size of a thumb. It ﬂoated in
midair silently in deﬁance of the laws of physics.
“What is this?” Klein muttered, but he didn’t dare to touch it rashly.
He had no intention of hiding the strange blood sphere. Firstly, he
didn’t know if it was a good or bad thing. Secondly, he was certain
that Frye, who had examined the corpse, would have long discovered
the brand on the wrist. It was even likely that he knew what the
strange blood sphere was.
And even if Frye doesn’t know, reporting it to Captain and letting the
Nighthawks research it is deﬁnitely better than me making random
attempts… That was Klein’s train of thought.
Being in an organization meant he had to know how to make use of
the organization’s powers to its fullest.
Klein waited nervously for a few minutes before he saw the black-
haired, blue-eyed, and thin-lipped Frye return.
He instantly noticed the strange blood sphere, and asked Klein a
question he had previously asked himself.
“What is this?”
“No idea.” Klein shook his head honestly. He recounted what had
happened without hiding anything.
“The brand slipped oﬀ into a blood sphere…” Frye nodded,
seemingly deep in thought. “The corpse of a Beyonder always tends
to have some strange transformations…”
He looked up and said to Klein, “Bring the Captain here. Inform him
about the contents that the corpse murmured as well.”
“Alright.” Klein was already itching to leave.
“You don’t have to return with the Captain,” Frye added. “I believe
you won’t like to see what happens next.”
As he spoke, he picked up a silver surgical knife beside him.
Klein nodded with some lingering fear.
“I was hoping you’d say that.”
He picked up his cane, wore his hat and hobbled over to the Chanis
Gate. At the Keeper’s room, he saw the no longer frail Captain Dunn.
After Dunn heard his recollection of what happened, he nodded
indiscernibly.
“I’ll report the matter to the higher ups and let the Holy Cathedral
deal with it. Maybe they’ll send people to the main peak of the
Hornacis mountain range to take a look.”
Klein answered brieﬂy in conﬁrmation. Seeing that only Sleepless
Kenley and the Captain were in the Keeper’s room, he casually asked,
“Are Mr. Aiur and the others resting?”
Dunn nodded and said, “Aiur and Borgia are at Saint Selena
Cathedral. Lorotta is probably looking for a coﬀee shop.”
“Coﬀee shop? Madam Lorotta hasn’t recovered from her injuries,
right?” Klein asked in surprise.
Dunn massaged his nose bridge and said with a laugh, “Lorotta has
three hobbies—coﬀee, dessert, and maidservants. She says she needs
these three things to speed up her recovery.”
“Maidservants?” Klein asked, perplexed.
Does Madam Lorotta have a particular fetish?
Dunn shook his head helplessly and said, “She likes maidservants.
Yeah, that’s right. Furthermore, she likes ones with big breasts.”
“…She sure is weird.” Klein had no idea what kind of expression he
should show in response.
Dunn didn’t delay any further as he headed out the Keeper’s room. As
Klein watched his back, he silently waited for him to turn.
Meanwhile, he noticed at the corner of his eye that Sleepless Kenley
had ﬁshed out his pocket watch and opened it.
Three, two, one… The moment Klein ﬁnished counting down silently,
Dunn stopped and turned around.
“Another thing I forgot. Klein, you went through a lot today. Once
you relax, you’ll feel exhausted. There’s no need for you to be here in
the afternoon. Go back and get some rest. Tomorrow, I’ll submit the
application listing the detailed losses.”
“Alright. Don’t worry too much about your killing of a Beyonder.
Killing him was equivalent to saving more lives.”
“As a matter of fact, I’m actually feeling much better.” Klein silently
exhaled.
Dunn nodded slightly and just as he turned around, he smacked
himself in the forehead.
“I’ve also handed the Beyonder’s sketch to Leonard. He and the police
department are in charge of the follow up investigations. I believe
that the Beyonder must’ve rode on carriages, eaten food, and had
somewhere to stay.
“Wherever he goes, whatever he touches, whatever he leaves behind,
even unconsciously, will serve as a silent witness against him.
Emperor Roselle’s words are truly sensible.”
“…Yes.” Klein answered, stupeﬁed.
After the captain walked far away, he left the Keeper’s room and
slowly walked to the second ﬂoor.
Along the way, he suddenly recalled something as he experienced an
additional bout of fear.
That suited clown claimed that the Secret Order controlled the
corresponding Sequence pathway of Seers… Even if he was exaggerating
and they didn’t have the higher Sequence potion formulas, they deﬁnitely
have the lower Sequence ones.
It also means that they have a number of Seers.
Then, wouldn’t they divine that I killed the suited clown and secretly exact
revenge against me?
If they can’t deal with the Nighthawks, can’t they deal with me, a Seer
without any direct measures against enemies?
Klein stopped in the stairwell and began thinking about the problem
seriously. Soon, he discovered that he was worrying over nothing.
Firstly, the Secret Order doesn’t know who are members of the
Nighthawks.
Secondly, even if they know one or two, they deﬁnitely wouldn’t include a
civilian staﬀ member like me.
Thirdly, under the present circumstances, unless they have a prophet,
there’s no way they can divine who the murderer is.
He heaved a sigh of relief and left the Blackthorn Security Company.
He took a public carriage back to Daﬀodil Street.
Even though he hadn’t eaten lunch yet, he still lacked the appetite.
After entering his bedroom, Klein removed his damaged suit ﬁrst.
Then, he took oﬀ his half top hat, got into bed and tried to go to
sleep.
His mind remained active as though his entire existence couldn’t
relax. His mind wasn’t repeating the scene of him shooting the suited
clown to death, but of the scene of him moving the corpse, and that
hair-raising experience.
He no longer felt uncomfortable about killing for the ﬁrst time, but
more of a disgust when he thought about it.
“This was probably Frye’s goal. He hoped that I would approach the
corpse and face it directly to overcome my trauma… But, even
though the trauma from before is gone, I’ve been traumatized by
something new…” Klein gave a self-deprecating laugh as he gradually
felt his nerves calm down.
He had no idea when he dozed oﬀ, but when he woke up, his
stomach was groaning in protest.
“I feel like I can eat an entire horse!” Klein muttered as he looked at
the sun setting in the west as though the sky was alit.
Changing into old but comfortable casual clothes, he briskly walked
to the ﬁrst ﬂoor. Before he could consider what to make for dinner,
he heard the door open.
Melissa… The corners of his mouth curled up at the thought.
Ever since she began taking the public carriage, his sister no longer
returned home late.
The key twisted as the door opened. Melissa walked in with her bag
that contained her books and stationery.
She looked at the kitchen and said, “Klein, there’s a letter for you. It’s
from your mentor.”
A letter from Mentor? Right. I wrote to him asking about the relevant
historical situation of the Hornacis main peak… Klein was taken aback
at ﬁrst before he recalled the matter.
Chapter 80: Banquet Invitation
After having dinner, a satiated Klein casually lounged on the living
room sofa. He used a small letter opener to open the letter he
received from his mentor.
Melissa was sitting by the dining table at the time, working hard on a
textbook problem, with the gas lamp for illumination. Benson was
cradled in a single seater, reading Accountancy for Beginners.
Klein found three pages in the letter that he read with both fear and
anticipation.
“…very happy to receive your letter. It reminds me of the good old
days over the past few years. Unfortunately, Welch and Naya have
left us forever…”
“I attended their burials separately and could feel their parents’
anguish. The two of them were young adults who were supposed to
have beautiful, bright futures ahead of them…”
“Fate is always so unpredictable. No one can know what will happen
to you next. I’ve experienced more as I’ve grown older, and I can
increasingly sense the weakness and helplessness of humanity.”
“…Regarding the historical information revolving around the
Hornacis main peak, I recall that the archaeologist, Mr. John Joseph,
once published a monograph detailing it. It includes his accounts of
his time at the Hornacis main peak. He discovered a few ancient
buildings that are more than a thousand years old.”
“What shames every historian and archaeologist is our inability to
precisely date the era. We can only make a crude estimate based on
the architecture style, the characteristics of the murals, and a few of
the texts that we can decipher.”
“It’s quite unbelievable that such a tall mountain peak would have
humans living there. Mr. Joseph has ample evidence to prove that
those humans developed a civilization that they can call their own.
As for the details, it is hard to fully describe them in this letter. I
suggest you try borrowing this monograph from the Deweyville
Library. Trust me, Sir Deweyville’s donation to this library makes it
have more books in its collection than the one built by the city
government.”
“The monograph’s title is Research of the Hornacis Main Peak’s
Relics. It is published by the Loen Publishing Firm.”
“In addition, there are some papers that discuss something of
relevance. They are published in the journals—New Archeology,
Archeology Summary. The exact issue and journal volume is…”
…
Klein read every word, and repeated the names of the monograph
and paper names silently.
Immediately afterwards, he found some paper and an envelope, as
well as a fountain pen before penning his gratitude.
“Melissa, help me send this letter out. This is the money for the
stamps.” Klein placed the sealed envelope and more than enough
money for the stamps on his sister’s desk.
Melissa took a glance and curled her lips.
“Klein, stamps don’t cost that much.”
“Yes, stamps don’t, but a girl should have some allowance.” Klein
replied with a smile. “I believe Selena has mentioned this to you
before.”
Noticing that Melissa was about to protest, he quickly added, “It can
be used to buy the materials and tools you need.”
“Tools…” Melissa repeated softly again and again before casting her
gaze back onto her books. “Alright,” she said as she nodded
imperceptibly.
The corners of Klein’s mouth immediately curved upwards as he
briskly walked back to the sofa.
“Excellent persuasion skills. You precisely pinpointed Melissa’s
weakness.” Benson gave a thumbs up as he said with a suppressed
laugh. Klein cleared his throat and said in all seriousness.
“Then how shall I persuade you? Your self-study should emphasize
language and ancient literature. Of course, basic mathematics and
logic are equally important.”
According to the curriculum of the public schools and grammar
schools, as well as the material tested for in college admissions, Klein
was very conﬁdent about the general direction in which the
upcoming ‘civil servant examinations’ would focus on.
Benson touched his hairline and said with a self-deprecating smile, “I
feel like a curly-haired baboon in front of those books.”
“But they’re really useful,” Klein said with a determined smile.
At that moment, Melissa put down her fountain pen, stood up, and
walked to the sofa.
“Benson, Klein. This Sunday is Selena’s birthday. She and her parents
wish to invite all of us to their place for a banquet. Are both of you
free?”
“Should be ﬁne for me,” Klein said after some thought.
He could take the opportunity to be acquainted with his sister’s
friends. It could prevent him from being utterly clueless whenever
something happened to her.
“Me too,” Benson said as he combed his hairs with his ﬁngers. “It
looks like we’ll have to think of a birthday present for Miss Selena.”
Klein smiled.
“This should be left to Melissa. She knows Miss Selena better than us.
Besides, what we need to do is what a gentleman ought to do—pay
for it.”
“This is the ﬁrst time I’ve heard someone describe laziness in such a
pleasant manner,” Benson said as he shook his head and chuckled.
Klein returned with a smile.
“This is the purpose of language and ancient literature.”
“…” Benson never expected Klein to return to the subject at hand; it
left him momentary speechless.
…
The next day, Klein wore his cheap formal suit and held his black
inlaid silver cane as he climbed up the stairs and arrived at the
Blackthorn Security Company’s entrance. His tuxedo had already
been sent to the tailors.
Klein was just about to greet Rozanne when he saw Captain Dunn
walk out of the partition.
“Good morning Klein. Did you have a good night’s sleep?” Dunn
asked with concern.
Klein answered honestly, “Better than I expected. I didn’t even have
nightmares. But I still feel heavy and a little disgusted when I recall
it.”
“Very good. I feel assured hearing that,” Dunn said with a nodding
smile.
After chatting about the weather, he raised a matter.
“The Holy Cathedral has replied to my telegram. Antigonus, Lorotta,
and company are to immediately escort Sealed Artifact 2-049 and the
Antigonus family’s notebook back to Backlund. They’ve also sent an
additional Nighthawk yesterday afternoon via steam locomotive to
help.”
“I believe that they’ve already set oﬀ by now.”
Already set oﬀ by now? Does that mean I’m completely free from the
traumatizing Antigonus family’s notebook? Klein was taken aback.
He found it surreal as though he was dreaming.
This is more relaxing than I imagined…
It’s unlikely that there will be any follow up, right?
“May the Goddess bless them and that they will have a smooth
journey.” After a few seconds of silence, Klein made a gesture on his
chest in the sign of the crimson moon.
Dunn wore his hat and pointed out the door.
“I have to patrol the Raphael Cemetery Garden. Heh, I forgot one
thing. The investigations of Leonard and the police department has
borne fruit. They found the carriage driver that drove them. We have
conﬁrmed their temporary residence in Tingen City, but they are
rather cautious. They didn’t leave behind any valuable clues.”
“As expected of an ancient secret organization,” Klein echoed
wistfully.
Dunn nodded and turned to head to the door.
He stopped three seconds later and turned his head.
“Also, the Holy Cathedral needs another two to three days before
they notify us of your application to become an oﬃcial member. Heh
heh, this is dealt with by a diﬀerent department, separate from the
one that deals with the Antigonus family’s notebook. They have
diﬀerent levels of eﬃciency.”
“I understand,” Klein replied sincerely.
Meanwhile, he helped his captain add inwardly.
Remember to submit the compensation application today!
Watching Dunn leave, Klein heard the brown-haired Rozanne
exclaim.
“Goddess! Klein, are you becoming a formal member? You haven’t
even joined us for a month!”
Klein smiled.
“After I consumed the Seer potion, it was only a matter of time.”
“That’s reasonable…” Rozanne fell into a daze for a few seconds
before suddenly sighing. “I was praying that you ﬁnished your
mysticism lessons so that you could be added to the roster for
watching the armory, but… Goddess, I have to be on duty every two
days. I’m not a Sleepless! My skin, my state of mind. Goddess, save
me!”
“Shouldn’t you be very familiar to such a lifestyle? Before I joined, it
has always been you, Bredt, and Old Neil who took turns, right?”
Klein asked, puzzled.
Rozanne shook her head with a depressed look.
“No, there were four previously, ﬁve even earlier. Unfortunately,
Kenley chose to become a Sleepless. Viola did not choose to extend
her contract last month and joined the Khoy Noel Machinery
Company. She’s a gifted girl when it comes to creation. She only
lacked the opportunity and money. Five years as a civilian staﬀ
allowed her to have enough savings.”
Having said this, Rozanne suddenly glanced at Klein and laughed
with her mouth covered.
“I’ve thought of a good solution. Klein, get married as soon as
possible. Then, accidentally expose the secret of Beyonders to her.
This is considered a very minor leak so there won’t be any
particularly heavy penalties. After all, who can lie to a person who
shares the same bed with you over prolonged periods of time. You
can introduce her to us when that happens make her a civilian staﬀ
member! What a perfect plan!”
The corners of Klein’s mouth twitched.
“Miss Rozanne, you can also quickly ﬁnd a husband. It should be
even easier. I believe you have the adequate means to divulge the
secret to him.”
Rozanne’s eyes widened and her mouth turned agape when she heard
him.
“How can I? Marriage is a very serious matter. I have to carefully
pick and observe him over a period of time to ensure that he’s
alright.”
That’s not what you said a second ago… Klein didn’t bother engaging
in sophistry with Rozanne. He smiled as he engaged in a little small
talk before bidding farewell and heading underground.
At the armory, he saw Old Neil wrestling with the handground
coﬀee. So, he sat down and waited patiently.
“Soon you’ll be an oﬃcial member, right?” Old Neil asked casually as
he ﬁltered the coﬀee.
“Captain said that another two to three days are needed. It’s still a
question of whether the Holy Cathedral will approve of it,” Klein said
frankly.
“Hehe.” Old Neil chortled. “The Holy Cathedral won’t deny cases like
these, especially when you’re already a Beyonder.”
With that said, he turned his head and faced Klein. He said with a
chuckle, “You must be mentally prepared. There’s a ritual every
oﬃcial Nighthawk member has to undergo. They have to complete a
mission independently. Of course, Dunn would deﬁnitely choose the
easiest and simplest ones for a rookie. Besides, you’re a support-type
Seer.”
Chapter 81: Finally Meeting
“I have to complete a mission independently in order to become an
oﬃcial member?” Klein was taken aback. “But we might not even
have a mission this week, and it might not be so simple.”
Wouldn’t this mean that it’ll take me one to two months to become a
oﬃcial Nighthawk? Only then will I get a pay rise…
Old Neil sniﬀed at the coﬀee and shot a glance at him.
“It’s only a ritual among Nighthawks. After all, we stand at the peak
of Beyonder danger and don’t want our teammates to act like
children who require constant care. This won’t aﬀect the salary that
you’ll receive as an oﬃcial member, or your privileges needed to
fulﬁll your duty.”
So it’s just a ritual to gain the recognition of the other Nighthawks… But,
Mr. Neil, why did you emphasize that it would not aﬀect my pay grade as
an oﬃcial member… Did I make it that obvious? Klein touched his face
and gave an embarrassed smile before asking, “Does it have to be a
mission of the Beyonder variety?”
“That should be the case, but your performance yesterday was truly
outstanding. You ingeniously killed a Beyonder that’s at least at
Sequence 8. I believe Frye, Royale, and the rest have already
acknowledged you. Therefore, Dunn might just assign you to an
ordinary mission,” Old Neil said before suddenly sighing. “You’ll
have your salary increase several-fold. I’ll never encounter something
like that again in my lifetime.”
Klein chuckled as he raised the matter about his Sequence pathway.
“Mr. Neil, do you think that the corresponding Sequence 8 of Seer is
Clown?”
In fact, thinking back to the description from the conﬁdential
documents, it did seem to add up.
A job good at ﬁghting with artiﬁce…
“I can’t give you any guarantees, but I think it’s highly likely. Firstly,
it matches up with what’s said on the documents. Their agile
movement and deception based battle style are key points. Next,
other Sequence pathways have similar situations. Do you know the
corresponding Sequence 8 for Mystery Pryer?” Old Neil asked with a
chuckle.
“No, it’s not written in the information provided by the Church.”
Klein shook his head honestly.
Old Neil chuckled brieﬂy before saying, “I’m close friends with two
old guys from the Machinery Hivemind. They mentioned it in
passing, as a joke. The corresponding Sequence 8 potion of Mystery
Pryer is Melee Scholar. Did you hear that? Melee Scholar. Goddess, I
don’t like melee combat at all. This doesn’t suit the image of a
Mystery Pryer at all!”
“I can understand… Mystery Pryer’s pursue the mysteries behind
things. Melee combat is one of those mysteries,” Klein said after some
thought.
Old Neil ﬁnished his handground coﬀee. “Alright, let’s not waste
time. Let’s continue our mysticism studies. You still have a lot of
ritualist magic that you need to grasp. You also need to learn how to
create amulets and charms.”
“Alright.” Klein sat down and planned out his schedule for the day.
In the morning I’ll study mysticism and read through all sorts of historical
records. I’ll submit the compensation request. After lunch, I’ll practice at
the Shooting Club. Then, I’ll head to the Deweyville Library at Golden
Indus Borough and see if I can borrow the corresponding monograph and
journal regarding the Hornacis main peak. After doing all that, if I have
time, I’ll spend some time at the Divination Club. I can’t slack oﬀ on my
“acting.”
Once the compensation request is approved and I receive the money, I’ll be
able to buy a new suit on the way home.
Yes… I’ll apply for the materials tomorrow morning and try to make a
protective amulet to ward oﬀ danger for Melissa and Benson.
…
In a dining hall adorned with a chandelier and elegant decorations.
A few friends were congratulating Joyce Meyer on his escape from
danger and his return to Tingen.
“We all read the news. Just the written description alone was enough
to scare me,” a man with a short stubble on his chin said wistfully.
“Joyce, I can’t believe you went through such an ordeal. Cheers. The
tragedy is over now, and the sunlight shines down upon us. Exalted is
the Steam.”
Joyce and his ﬁancée, Anna, raised their cups and clinked them
together with their friends. Then, they gulped down what little
champagne they had left.
“Anna was extremely worried at the time. I suspect that she cried
every night. Whenever I invited her for some afternoon tea, she was
always absent minded. Thankfully, you’re ﬁnally back now.
Otherwise, I reckon she would’ve passed away just like that,” a young
lady, with a cute small nose and coiled brown hair, said to Joyce as
she glanced at Anna.
“If Anna were to experience something like that, I’d be the same. I
might be in an even worse state.” The aquiline-nosed Joyce gave his
ﬁancée, who was sitting beside him, a gentle look.
Anna wasn’t used to expressing her emotions in front of others. She
looked at the opposite end of the table and said, “Bogda, why have
you been keeping your head down this entire time? I can sense how
terrible your mood is.”
The young lady with a petite nose answered in Bogda’s place.
“Bogda is sick. The physician told him that there’s something
seriously wrong with his liver. He can only use medicine to reduce
the pain but it doesn’t treat his illness. He needs to undergo surgery.”
“Lord, when did this happen?” Anna and Joyce asked in surprise and
concern.
Bogda was a young man with short hair, but his face was sallow. His
usually brilliant red eyes were replaced with a dim glow.
“It happened last week. Since Joyce wasn’t back yet, I told Irene not
to tell you,” Bogda explained with a rueful smile.
Joyce asked staidly, “Have you decided when you’ll undergo
surgery?”
Bogda’s expression changed a few times as he said, “No, I haven’t
decided yet. As you know, those surgeons are practically butchers.
The patient is like a piece of meat on a chopping block, allowing
them to butcher people as they please! I’ve read a lot of reports.
They’ll even use an ax for amputation! Lord, I suspect I might very
well die on the operating table.”
“But if you delay it further then surgery might not be able to save
you,” the man with a stubble said as he tried to persuade him.
At that moment, Anna interjected, “Bogda, perhaps you can consider
doing a divination. If the divination indicates that everything will go
smoothly, then proceed with the surgery as soon as possible. If the
outcome of the divination is bad, seek other means. Seek it with the
help of the fortune-teller. I know of a real, mysterious fortune-teller.
No, I should address him as a Seer. I believe he can deﬁnitely help
you.”
“For real?” Bogda returned with a question, clearly looking doubtful.
Their other friends shared the same attitude.
“Yes.” Anna nodded without hesitation. “I hired his divination
services, and after divining Joyce’s situation, he told me to return
home. ‘Your ﬁancé is at home waiting for you.’ Back then, I was like
all of you, ﬁlled with doubt. But when I returned home, I really saw
Joyce. He was really back!”
“I can testify on this point,” Joyce echoed.
He didn’t mention that he had sought Klein’s help in interpreting his
dreams. This was because the police had informed him that Tris
hadn’t been caught yet. Therefore, he had to keep it a secret in order
to prevent revenge from being exacted upon him.
“Lord, this is absolutely unbelievable!”
“Is divination really that magical?”
…
Amidst the shouting, Bogda thought deeply for a moment before
saying, “Perhaps I should get a divination. Anna, Joyce, could you
tell me the Seer’s name and address?”
Anna heaved a sigh of relief and said, “You made a very wise choice.”
“That Seer is at the Divination Club at Howes Street.
“His name is Klein Moretti.”
…
Golden Indus Borough. Deweyville Library.
Klein used the introduction note from his mentor’s letter to
successfully apply for a borrowing pass.
As he ﬂipped the tiny card in his hand, he asked a few librarians, “Do
you have the Research of the Hornacis Main Peak’s Relics here? It
was published by the Loen Publishing Firm.”
A librarian immediately answered, “Please wait a moment. Let me
check the records.”
He turned around and looked at the drawers. He pulled open the
letter that matched Hornacis and ﬂipped through a card that was
ﬁlled with single words that followed a particular order.
On careful inspection, he shook his head and said, “Sorry, Sir. We do
not have this book in our collection.”
“How regretful,” Klein answered in clear disappointment.
From the looks of it, I need to write to the Loen Publishing Firm or pay a
visit to the Khoy University…
Meanwhile, he sighed inwardly at how dated the management of the
libraries of this world was.
You people need a computer. Unfortunately, I can’t produce one… Klein
made a silent, self-deprecating comment and turned to ask, “Then, do
you have the journal issues of New Archeology and Archeology
Summary?”
“We do,” the librarian conﬁrmed. “A gentleman just returned them.”
He ﬂipped out the corresponding card and pointed Klein in the
direction of the bookshelf.
Klein went over to the bookshelf, scanned the journal issues, and
pulled out the ones his mentor mentioned.
Then, he randomly found a spot by the window to sit down. Under
the bright afternoon sun, he began reading the information in the
library quietly.
“…Ancient relics don’t solely exist on the main peak of the Hornacis
mountain range. They’re also spread out across the surrounding
forests, valleys, and gentle slopes around the main peak…”
“…These relics are formed from lofty domes and gigantic stone
columns. Honestly, they can be be described as magniﬁcent…”
“…I’m curious as to how the original residents mine and process
these rocks? Hypothetically, let’s assume that they performed their
mining operation on the spot without needing to send them up the
mountain…”
“…There’s a strange pattern where the relics become larger in size
the closer you are to the mountain peak. But surprisingly, there are
no ruins on the peak. According to our hypothesis, there should be
palaces that don’t resemble man-made buildings, divine halls used for
sacriﬁces…”
Palaces that don’t look like they were man-made… divine halls used for
sacriﬁces… Could it be the one that I saw in my dream? While Klein
ruminated, he suddenly heard footsteps approaching him from a
distance.
He looked up and saw a familiar face, a face that often appeared on
the papers.
He had a squarish face, thick eyebrows, a ﬁrm nose, short dark-blond
hair, azure-blue eyes, and tightly-closed lips. All of these features
belonged to a certain famous person from Tingen City, a
philanthropist, entrepreneur, and the owner of this library—Sir
Deweyville.
Beside Deweyville was the middle-aged butler who Klein had met
before.
Klein watched them walk by from more than ten meters away. Out of
curiosity, he raised his right hand and lightly tapped his glabella
twice.
Chapter 82: Herb Store
Various colors surfaced as auras and entered Klein’s eyes. He casually
studied Sir Deweyville’s condition.
He’s very healthy; there are almost no hidden problems… His emotional
state is horrendous. Amid the dullness, there’s frailty… His mental state is
frail? He has trouble sleeping well? But the purple aura at his head is
completely ﬁne… Klein muttered silently to himself as Sir Deweyville
walked oﬀ and left the library.
Retracting his gaze, Klein pinched his forehead and sighed inwardly.
Being a tycoon sure isn’t easy…
He didn’t pay much attention to the matter and returned his gaze
onto the journal issues in front of him.
Klein didn’t ﬁnd a lot of clues after reading each of them. He could
only conﬁrm a few things.
Firstly, there existed an ancient kingdom on the Hornacis mountain
range, as well as its surroundings. The ancient kingdom’s history
dated back to at least 1500 years. Secondly, their architectural style
was primarily about being grand. They left behind all sorts of murals
and from those murals, it could be deduced that they believed that
the Evernight would protect the loved ones of the departed. Finally,
in the ruins, there were symbols that represented the Evernight
everywhere, but they were clearly diﬀerent from the Evernight
Sacred Emblem.
“If I had a chance, no— even if I have a chance, I’ll never go there!”
Klein muttered with clenched teeth. He vowed not to court death.
After tidying the journal articles and returning them back to their
original spots, he put on his hat, lifted his cane, and left the
Deweyville library.
…
Divination Club.
Bogda looked at the beautiful lady in charge of receiving guests and
said, “I’d like to have a divination.”
Angelica smiled politely and said, “Do you have a preferred fortune-
teller? Or would you like to ﬂip through our introduction guide and
choose the one that’s most suitable for you?”
Bogda pressed the right side of his abdomen and gasped silently for
breath while saying, “I wish to have Mr. Klein Moretti divine for me.”
“But Mr. Moretti is not here today,” Angelica answered with
uncertainty.
Bogda fell silent for a moment as he paced a few steps and asked,
“When will Mr. Moretti be available?”
“No one knows. He has his own matters to deal with. From what I’ve
seen, he usually comes here on Monday afternoons,” Angelica said as
she pondered over the matter.
“Alright.” Bogda’s face darkened as he turned around, planning to
leave.
“Sir, you can choose other fortune-tellers as well. For example, you
can choose Mr. Hanass Vincent who is famous in Tingen City,”
Angelica tried her best to prevent the loss of business.
Bogda stopped in his tracks and considered it for a moment before
saying, “No, I only trust Mr. Moretti. Well, can I wait here for a
moment? Perhaps he might come after he’s done with his matters.”
“No problem,” Angelica said with a warm smile.
Bogda went to the sofa and sat down. Sometimes he stroked his cane;
at other times he looked out the window, clearly looking rather
impatient.
Seconds turned to minutes. Just as Bogda’s mind was in a mess,
unsure if he should continue waiting or leave, he heard the beautiful
lady exclaim in pleasant surprise, “Good afternoon, Mr. Moretti!”
Klein saw the familiar Angelica and was just about to ask why it was
always her. Did she not need to rest or take any days oﬀ?
However, he immediately took into consideration that he was a Seer,
so it was not appropriate for him to ask such questions. Instead, he
had to use the tone of a charlatan and say something like: “How
marvelous it is for fate to compel us to meet once again, Madam
Angelica.”
Uh, would this sound like I’m hitting on her? Klein’s mind whirled as he
ﬁnally replied with a smile, “Good afternoon, Madam Angelica.”
“A customer wishes to hire you for a divination.” Angelica pointed to
Bogda who had hurriedly stood up from the sofa.
Someone actually requested for me? Klein took oﬀ his half top hat in
pleasant surprise, pinching his glabella twice while doing so.
“Good afternoon, Sir…” He looked over when his voice suddenly
came to a pause.
In his Spirit Vision, he saw the requester’s liver looking dim. It was
nearly black in color. It was making the rest of his body unbalanced
as his aura was thin in various places.
Klein deliberated over his words and he said in a serious expression,
“Sir, you should see a doctor and not seek a divination.”
Bogda stood stunned on the spot as he immediately gave a pleasant
look of surprise while muttering, “How fascinating…”
“Anna wasn’t lying to me…”
…
He hurriedly looked up at Klein in earnest.
“Mr. Moretti, I’ve already seen a doctor and might have to undergo
surgery. However, I’m frightened about the surgery. I would like to
divine the outcome.”
The surgery of this era is really fraught with danger… Although Emperor
Roselle had given the impetus, this era still lacks most of the necessary
technology… Klein didn’t reject his request and nodded slightly.
“My divination fee is eight pence. Is that ﬁne?”
“Eight pence?” Bogda exclaimed in surprise. “You’re only charging
eight pence?”
According to Anna’s description, and the performance Mr. Moretti had
just shown me, I’m willing to pay at least a pound!
Haven’t you heard of small margins with large volume? Klein was
embarrassed for a moment. After thinking for a few seconds, he
calmly smiled and replied, “It is enough just being blessed with the
ability to receive revelations from the divine and catch a glimpse of
fate. Therefore, we must maintain our humility and suppress our
greed. Only by doing so, can we continue being bestowed with our
gifts.”
“You are a true seer.” Bogda held his chest and bowed, his tone ﬁlled
with sincerity.
Upon receiving Bogda’s praise and trust, Klein’s spirituality seemed to
relax. As for the description of his “principles”, it also gave him some
new insight.
“Miss. Angelica, is Topaz available?” He turned to the beautiful lady
beside him.
Angelica heaved a sigh of relief for Bogda as she smiled sweetly.
“Yes.”
After entering the divination room, Klein instructed Bogda to lock the
door. Then, he sat behind the table and pinched his forehead.
“Shall we use tarot cards for the divination?” he inquired with a
smile.
“Spirit Dowsing” was only suitable to determine matters related to
him. As for drawing an astrolabe, it was too time consuming.
“I’ll leave it up to you.” Bogda had no objections.
Therefore, Klein helped him shuﬄe and cut the deck before laying
them out in an Intis formation.
Thanks to his uniqueness as a Seer, Klein did not ﬂip the other cards.
Instead, he directly ﬂipped the card that indicated the ﬁnal result.
“A reversed Wheel of Fortune. Things will develop badly.” he said
solemnly as he shot a glance.
The color in Bogda’s face drained instantly and his lips trembled.
“Is it hopeless?”
As Klein tried his best to think of a solution, he said, “Let me try a
diﬀerent divination method. Please leave your ring behind. Next,
write your date of birth on this piece of paper. Then, please wait
outside quietly.”
Inﬂuenced by his gentle and comforting tone, Bogda calmed down
and followed the instructions by writing down the information and
leaving his ring behind.
As he watched Bogda leave, Klein wrote a sentence on the piece of
paper.
“Outcome of Bogda Jones’s surgery.”
He picked up the ring and paper slip and leaned back into his seat
before using a dream divination technique.
In a blurry and distorted world, he gradually found himself, only to
see the gentleman collapse with an ashen expression. He was covered
in white cloth as he was pushed out of the quaking operating room.
This time, Klein didn’t encounter anything strange. He no longer felt
the sense of being watched, so he quickly woke up. He knitted his
brows tightly as he considered how he was going to inform Bogda
about the outcome.
The surgery may very well lead to death… I can try the restorative
ritualistic magic I learned today… but that would expose the matter of
Beyonders. Besides, I have to apply for Captain’s approval ﬁrst… Yeah,
and I might not be able to treat such a severe disease… Klein was
racking his brains when he suddenly thought of something.
“Mr. Glacis’s lung disease was treated by an apothecary. He said that
the medicine was extremely miraculous… What was it? Right,
Lawson Darkwade, 18 Vlad Street in East Borough. Lawson’s Folk
Herb Store!” As he tried his best to memorize the address back then,
Klein quickly remembered the details.
He rapped the corners of the table and quickly made a decision.
After using Spirit Dowsing to quickly determine if it was a good or
bad idea, Klein walked out the door. When he saw Bogda stand up in
a ﬂuster, he returned his ring to him and said warmly with a smile, “I
found hope for you.”
“Really?” Bogda asked pleasantly surprised.
Klein did not reply him as he continued talking.
“Your hope lies in the East Borough, on Vlad Street. It’s related to the
single term Lawson.”
“If you can’t ﬁnd it, come back here again on Monday at four in the
afternoon.”
“Good. Good.” Bogda nodded as he repeated himself. He excitedly
ﬁshed out his wallet and produced ﬁve pence and three pennies.
He had done according to what Klein had said, without using tips to
corrupt a true seer.
The corners of Klein’s lips twitched as he received the money, but he
smiled brilliantly.
“I hope you will ﬁnd hope as soon as possible.”
After Bogda left, he handed over the commission like the previous
time and also gave Angelica tips, pretending as though he had
collected a soli.
…
East Borough. Vlad Street.
Bogda walked from one end of the street to the other, repeating it
three times until his liver started to ache.
Finally, he determined that there was only one place that had
anything to do with Lawson on the street. It was the Lawson’s Folk
Herb Store, numbered 18 on the street.
Mustering his courage, he walked in and caught the smell of the
various herbs. He saw that the owner of the shop had black but very
short hair. His face was round and he looked to be in his thirties or
forties.
The boss’s formal attire resembled that of a village witchdoctor. It
was a deep black robe embroidered with all kinds of strange symbols.
“Hello, do you have medicine that can treat my disease?” Bogda
asked politely.
The boss raised his head and swept his deep blue eyes across Bogda
and smiled.
“Your liver disease is very serious, but the premise of everything is
whether you have the money. Do you have enough to pay for the
medicine?”
He can tell? Bogda suddenly felt a lot more conﬁdent as he nodded
frantically.
“How much is your medicine?”
“Ten pounds. It’s a very fair price.” The boss ﬁshed out a bag of herbs
from under the counter and said, “Add suﬃcient water and boil it
into medicine. After boiling it, add ten drops of fresh rooster blood,
then drink it down immediately. This bag of herbs can be cooked
thrice. You will be ﬁne after three times.”
As he spoke, he opened the yellowish-brown paper and threw in all
sorts of strange herbs.
It sounds extremely shady… Bogda gulped down his saliva and said,
“That’s it?”
The boss stared at him and immediately smiled.
“Do you still want something else? What about this bag? Once you
recover from your liver disease, I can give you a guarantee that your
wife will be very satisﬁed.”
He chuckled as he took out a black-papered bag of herbs and
suppressed his voice.
“There’s mummy powder inside… Trust me, a lot of aristocrats
consume this stuﬀ. They put it in their tea or boil it as soup.”
… Bogda’s conﬁdence in the boss wavered to the point of feeling
disgusted.
I believe in Mr. Moretti… He took a deep breath, ﬁshed out his wallet,
and pulled out the two biggest notes from what little was left of his
gold pounds.
Chapter 83: Carving
Holding onto the yellowish-brown paper bag full of herbs, Bogda
staggered out of the Lawson’s Folk Herb Store.
While waiting for a tracked carriage, he suddenly came to a
realization.
He had spent ten pounds to buy a bag of stuﬀ?
This was nearly a month’s salary for him!
If it wasn’t for his trust in Anna and Joyce, he wouldn’t have brought
that much cash to the Divination Club!
Could it be that the reason why Mr. Moretti only accepted eight pence for
his divination, had something to do with his collusion with the boss of
Lawson’s Folk Herb Store, so as to earn more? This was a classic scam
written on the papers! When Bogda made this connection, he even
began to suspect Klein a little. He even began suspecting Joyce and
Anna.
When a tracked carriage stopped in front of him, he looked at the
herbs in his hand. Unable to bring himself to return, he entered the
carriage with a heavy heart.
…
Inside Lawson’s Folk Herb Store.
As the boss watched Bogda leave, he suddenly turned his head and
shouted at the door where there was a pile of herbs, “Scharmaine,
stop purchasing herbs from today.”
“W-why, Master?” A handsome-looking youth with disheveled hair
walked out.
The boss smiled and said, “This is the sixteenth customer that has
come because of my fame. If this carries on, I believe the
Nighthawks, the Machinery Hivemind, and the Mandated Punishers
will notice me. When the time comes, I’ll need to consider heading to
other cities.”
“Then, do we need to sublease this store?” Scharmaine nodded in
understanding as he asked with concern.
The boss chuckled.
“If you wish to stay, you can be the boss of this store. You are already
capable at identifying herbs and concocting medicine. Of course,
remember to deposit half of your monthly proﬁts into my anonymous
Backlund Bank account.”
“But, I haven’t learned what you are really good at.” Scharmaine was
already sick of never staying in a city for more than a year, but he
was unwilling to give up learning the magical formulas that his
master was good at.
The boss leisurely rocked himself in his seat.
“That’s not something you can learn just because you want to…”
…
A blackish-green bubbling liquid appeared in front of Bogda’s eyes. It
smelled of stinking socks and the color that makes one want to puke
made him deeply suspicious about everything he had done today.
When the rooster blood was dropped into the medicine, Bogda’s
father looked at his son worriedly and said, “I think surgery is the
best option.”
The few drops of rooster blood bubbled with the boiling liquid before
vanishing. Bogda took a deep breath and said, “If this medicine is
useless, I’ll consider surgery.”
“The Lord will watch over you.” Bogda’s father gestured a triangular
Sacred Emblem across his chest.
By the time the boiling liquid had cooled down, Bogda had no
intention of wasting the ten pounds. He raised his right hand and
closed his eyes. Flicking his head back, he gulped down the medicine
in one go.
The pungent aroma that had the noxious smell of blood, swished
around in his mouth as he nearly spat out everything he had just
drank.
That night, Bogda had an upset stomach. He went to the bathroom
six times, and by the time the crimson moon vanished, he fell asleep
groggily.
After an unknown period of time had passed, he jolted awake, having
dreamed that he was being reprimanded by his boss at work.
“Thankfully, I took three days of annual leave. I don’t have to rush to
work.” Bogda heaved a sigh of relief when he discovered that he felt
a lot more spirited.
This was in stark contrast to the sluggish state he was in for the past
few weeks.
Bogda subconsciously reached out and pressed the right side of his
abdomen. He noticed that the region which previously hurt when
under slight pressure felt normal. He only felt the pain from ordinary
pressure.
“Don’t tell me it was really eﬀective? That apothecary was clearly
just fooling me…” Bogda was both surprised and doubtful as he got
out of bed. He stretched himself and felt his health returning to him.
He fell silent for a very long while as he muttered, “According to the
apothecary, I still need to drink it twice. Once I’m done drinking, I’ll
go to the hospital to get a check up from a doctor…
“That apothecary didn’t tell me how many times I can drink a day…
“…I still think he’s a cheat…”
…
Inside the civilian staﬀ oﬃce of the Blackthorn Security Company,
from his prior request, Klein received a space where no one would
disturb him.
He held a carving knife and emitted his spirituality. He seriously
carved the incantations and symbols onto two silver accessories.
The incantation was a request to avoid disaster and was written in
Hermes. The two mysticism symbols symbolized the Evernight
Goddess as well as the Empress of Disaster and Horror.
Aside from that, Klein also added the Path Number that corresponded
to the Goddess, 7, and the magical characteristic.
In addition to that, charms and amulets had to be engraved on both
sides; and each side’s symbols, incantations, and characteristics, their
exact locations, or special formats was in the realm of mysticism. The
ones that were spread amongst the ordinary populace were ﬁlled
with mistakes.
At that moment, Klein had a lot of damaged materials to his right.
Through repeated practise, and only after he conﬁrmed that he had
enough practice, did he dare to begin creating the amulets for Benson
and Melissa.
As he calmed his mind, his spirituality spewed out from the tip of the
carving knife. The number 7 appeared on the surface of the silver
accessories.
He had already ﬁnished carving the incantations and symbols on the
other side of the accessory. All that was left was to ﬁnish the
remaining side.
After putting down his knife, all his spirituality chained together as
Klein suddenly felt a strange, majestic, and terrifying energy surge
throughout the room.
The commotion quickly vanished as the incantations on both sides of
the accessory became complete with Klein’s Spirit Vision. It emitted a
serene blackness.
He put down his carving knife and gently polished the silver
accessory that was formed from a circle and a vertical piece. He felt a
tinge of coolness from the mild-to-the-touch surface.
“It’s done!” He happily placed the ﬁnished amulet and another one
that he had previously ﬁnished into his pocket, planning to ﬁnd an
opportunity to give it to Benson and Melissa.
Amulets created by Beyonders possessed a certain level of
eﬀectiveness. They allowed the wearer to unknowingly avoid
disasters to a certain extent, but it was nothing too ridiculous.
Furthermore, their spirituality would wane bit by bit. Unless one
used a high-level ritualistic magic and created a prayer set, a year
was the maximum one could use them for. As for high-level ritualistic
magic, there was a terrifyingly high spirituality requirement. It
wasn’t something Klein could endure at the moment.
When the time comes, I can use my spirituality to make another one…
Klein thought, nodding as he began tidying up the messy table.
He didn’t make one for himself for the moment, because an amulet of
that level had limited eﬀects on him. Therefore, his goal was to gain
a deeper understanding of incantations before trying to pair it with
ritualistic magic. That way he could create a few defensive amulets
that could be activated speciﬁcally with sound.
After everything was ﬁnished, Klein walked out the oﬃce and
prepared to hand over the damaged materials. That was when he saw
Captain Dunn walk over in his black windbreaker.
Dunn’s deep and gray eyes swept across him as he smiled.
“Klein, the Holy Cathedral has approved it. You’re now an oﬃcial
member.”
“Really? That’s great!” Klein expressed his delight.
Dunn nodded and said with a smile, “You can now receive a make-up
pay of three pounds for this week. You’ll receive 4.50 pounds every
subsequent week until the advance payment is cleared.
“By the way, did I mention the Nighthawks’ ritual?
“Every oﬃcial Nighthawk has to independently complete a mission.
Only by doing so will you gain the recognition of your partners. In
consideration of the outstanding performance you showed, I believe I
can assign you an ordinary mission instead. When that happens, I’ll
formally introduce you to all the Nighthawks in Tingen City.”
Klein replied without hesitation, “Alright!”
Three pounds plus his compensation of seven pounds. Getting a new
suit wasn’t a problem anymore!
Furthermore, he would still have plenty left over!
Well, who knows when my mission will arrive…
Klein waited all the way till Sunday, the day of Selena’s birthday
banquet.
…
Changing into his formal suit and using a brush and handkerchief to
tidy his half top hat, Klein looked himself in the mirror before
walking over to the ﬁrst ﬂoor in satisfaction.
At that moment, Melissa was sizing up Benson’s clothes.
“Is there a problem?” Benson raised his cane, feeling a little lacking
due to his sister’s gaze.
He felt that there was nothing wrong with him when he inspected
himself. He was already dressed quite decently.
Melissa stopped staring at him and said with a serious expression,
“Benson, that is a very old suit you’re wearing.”
“There will be a lot of excellent ladies and madams participating in
today’s birthday banquet. I believe that by wearing that, it’ll be a
form of disrespect to them.”
Klein was originally ﬁlled with questions. However, when he heard
Melissa’s emphasis, he immediately realized what was happening. He
went over with a chuckle and said, “Benson and I share a similar
build. He can wear my other tuxedo.”
He had already informed his siblings about buying a new suit. He
explained it away by saying that his clothes had been torn while
inspecting certain objects. Therefore, the company generously
compensated him. Of course, he concealed the matter of him being
“promoted with a pay rise.” He was afraid of scaring them and only
planned to tell them after half a year.
Such an explanation made Blackthorn Security Company and Melissa
extremely envious. They felt that the Blackthorn Security Company
was an impeccable employer.
“There’s no need to, right?” Benson retorted, having not realized the
gravity of the situation.
“No, it’s extremely important.” Klein pushed Benson’s shoulders up
the stairs. “My tuxedo is hanging on the clothes rack.”
After watching Benson go up the stairs in a daze, Klein turned around
and smiled at Melissa.
“Are you hoping that Benson will use the opportunity provided by
Selena’s birthday banquet to begin a beautiful new romance?”
He had been reading quite a fair amount of newspapers and
magazines recently. He knew that aristocrats and middle-class
banquets were typically grounds for blind dates.
Melissa nodded solemnly.
“Yes, Benson has missed out too much because of us.”
Sis, why are you like a mother… Klein looked at Melissa as he
suddenly shook his head with an exasperated laugh.
Chapter 84: Elizabeth
Seeing the unconvinced look his sister’s face, Klein suddenly felt like
it was a good opportunity. He sized her up and said with a solemn
expression, “Melissa, I think you aren’t showing enough respect to
today’s banquet as well.”
“What?” Melissa wore a puzzled look.
Klein pointed at her neck.
“As a lady, you are lacking a necklace that accentuates that area.”
Without waiting for his sister to say another word, he smiled as he
ﬁshed out a silver amulet wrapped with angel wings from his pocket.
“Thankfully, I prepared one for you.”
“…” Melissa was taken aback at ﬁrst before she asked, “How much
was it?”
Sis, your concerns are really quite misplaced… Klein silently scoﬀed as
he explained with a chuckle, “It’s actually not very expensive. Since it
was in an incomplete state, I imitated an item that I’ve seen before
and engraved blessing incantations and beautiful patterns on them.”
“You engraved them?” Melissa was indeed distracted.
“How is it? What do you think of my work?” Klein took the
opportunity to hand over the amulet to his sister.
Melissa studied it before gently biting down on her lip.
“I like the surrounding angel feathers.”
If you think the incantations and symbols I engraved are ugly then just say
so. There’s no need to mince your words… An amulet’s value is in its
eﬀects! The corner of Klein’s mouth twitched. Just as he was about to
urge his sister to accept it, he saw Melissa put on the necklace with a
forced expression on her face. She then carefully adjusted the
positioning of the amulet.
“Perfect.” Klein sized her up and gave her exaggerated praise.
Melissa shot him a glance and looked down at her amulet. She said
listlessly, “Klein, you were never like that before. Acting like that…”
“Perhaps it’s because of my good job. With a decent income, I’ve
become more conﬁdent.” Klein interrupted his sister and gave a
preemptive explanation.
Sigh, even though I received the original Klein’s memory fragments,
making myself appear natural in most major aspects, certain ﬁne details
are still there. I’m still used to presenting my real personality… Especially
when I’m getting closer and more familiar with Benson and Melissa… He
sighed inwardly.
Melissa seemed to accept his explanation and pouted her lips.
“It’s great that you’re like that… really great…”
After the two engaged in a short conversation, Benson came down
having changed his clothes. He wore a white shirt with a black vested
tuxedo. His black bowtie and a pair of long, straight trousers made it
seem like he had undergone a complete makeover. It was like he was
a successful businessman after years of hard work.
Same for the receding hairline… Klein chuckled inwardly.
“Excellent, Benson. It suits you very well,” he said with a brilliant
smile while throwing up his hands.
Melissa also nodded in agreement on the sideline.
“The facts show that my clothing is more important than me.” Benson
gave a self-derisive comment.
Klein took the opportunity to ﬁsh out the remaining amulet and
repeated his explanation from earlier before saying, “I also made one
for you.”
“Not bad. I’ll bring it with me.” Benson accepted it without a fuss as
he quipped, “Klein, I wouldn’t ﬁnd it odd, even if you were to
suddenly know how to style your hair, make clothes, ﬁx watches, and
feed curly-haired baboons.”
“Life is just so full of surprises,” Klein replied with a smile.
Following that, the siblings tidied themselves up before walking out
the main door. They took a trackless public carriage and arrived at
the North Borough’s Fania Street where Selena’s house was.
The Wood family lived in a terrace house as well, but unlike Klein’s
place, they had a porch. They had a small lawn in the front which
made it look very elegant.
When they rung the doorbell, Klein, Benson, and Melissa only had to
wait for around ten seconds before they were able to see the star of
the day, Selena Wood.
With a head covered in wine-red hair, the girl gave Melissa a
delighted hug.
“I like this dress of yours. It makes you look exceptionally beautiful.”
Standing beside Selena Wood was her father, Mr. Wood, senior
employee of Backlund Bank’s Tingen branch.
“Welcome, our honorable elder brother. Welcome, our young
historian.” He deliberately addressed Benson and Klein in an
exaggerated manner.
Young historian… Why doesn’t he add the description of me having a
conscience?…Klein retorted as he took oﬀ his hat and replied with a
smile, “Mr. Wood, you look much more spirited and younger than I
imagined.”
His style of ﬂattery had unknowingly inclined himself to the
Foodaholic Empire.
Benson held out his hand and shook Wood’s hand.
“I know a lot of bank employees, but they’re all equally arrogant and
stiﬀ, as though they’re the latest machines. None of them are as
civilized as you.”
“If you were to meet me at the bank, you might not say that about
me.” Wood laughed cheerfully.
After exchanging pleasantries, Selena, who was wearing a new dress,
led the siblings inside with a hop in her step. At times, she would
mention in her usual tone that, “Elizabeth is already here,” and at
other times, she would suppress her voice saying, “Melissa, your
brothers are more handsome than I imagined.”
Hey, I have good hearing… Although you are ﬂattering me… Klein
helplessly looked at the two sixteen-year-old girls walking ahead of
him.
This isn’t right. I’m still quite far from being considered handsome… Tsk,
Miss Selena, how ugly did you imagine Benson and I to be? A balding,
gloomy, fat man with a pale expression and lifeless eyes? Klein pinched
his glabella in passing as he diligently practiced his Spirit Vision.
Miss Selena Wood is healthy. She’s excited and very happy… Mr. Wood’s
lungs are a little problematic. Right, I see his pipe… Klein swept his gaze
across the crowd while in a good mood.
“Elizabeth, Melissa is here.” At that moment, Selena introduced with
a brisk tone.
A girl dressed in a blue frilly dress walked over. She had naturally
curled brown hair and adorable baby fat.
Klein was stunned when he saw her because he knew the girl.
He had helped her choose an amulet back at the underground
market!
Elizabeth greeted Melissa ﬁrst before looking at Benson and Klein.
She was stunned and her brows knitted slightly, as though she was
thinking about something.
Soon, Elizabeth smiled and politely greeted them as though nothing
had happened.
Klein also pretended not to recognize her. Under Wood’s lead, they
came to the sofa in the living room where they were introduced to
Chris—Selena Wood’s brother—and the other guests.
As Klein watched Benson chat with Chris and the other solicitors
happily over the topic of their neighbor, Mr. Shaud, he couldn’t help
but feel envious.
I don’t have such socializing skills… He picked up a cocktail from a
table in the corner of the room as he listened quietly. At times, he
would nod and echo with a smile.
It didn’t take long before all the guests arrived and the banquet
oﬃcially began.
As too many guests had been invited, the Wood family’s dining table
could not accommodate everyone. Therefore, the banquet was done
in a buﬀet manner. The maidservant served the steak dishes, roast
chicken, fried ﬁsh, mashed potatoes, etc and placed them on diﬀerent
tables. The male servants were responsible for carving the meat,
allowing for guests to take what they wanted.
Klein couldn’t help but click his tongue when he saw the elegant
enamel plates and silver cutlery. He felt that the Woods were being
too extravagant as a middle-class family.
Since they’re so rich, why would Chris need so many years to prepare for
his wedding?” When he thought of what his sister had previously
mentioned, he was puzzled. “Yeah, it was probably to save up money to
buy this cutlery that would have taken them so many years to aﬀord. To
such families, they have to look respectable!
Amidst his mixed emotions, Klein picked up a plate and walked in
front of a dining table. He forked a piece of honey-glazed roasted
meat.
At that moment, Elizabeth with her adorable baby fat cheeks came
over. As she looked at the food, she whispered, “So you are Melissa’s
brother… Thank you. Selena likes the amulet I gave her a lot. She
said that she felt healthier the moment she wore it.”
Selena… Amulet… Klein suddenly recalled the reason for selecting an
amulet for the girl beside him.
It was to give to a friend who liked mysticism as a birthday gift!
That friend was Selena? Selena liked items related to mysticism? Klein
frowned slightly as he smiled politely.
“It might just be akin to a placebo eﬀect.”
After saying that, he began waiting for her to praise Emperor Roselle.
However, Elizabeth’s reaction was that of confusion.
“What’s a placebo eﬀect?”
“It means it’s completely psychological. At times, we believe that we
will turn for the better and end up really becoming better,” Klein
explained crudely.
“No, she said it’s diﬀerent from the amulets that she bought in the
past. It feels diﬀerent,” Elizabeth emphasized.
She cocked her head and shot a glance at Klein and said curiously, “I
never expected Melissa’s brother to be an expert at mysticism.”
“As you know, I studied history, so it’s common to encounter similar
matters.” Klein diverted the topic skillfully as he asked, “Are you also
studying at the Tingen Technical School?”
“No, Selena and I were Melissa’s former schoolmates. Later, she went
to a technical school. I study at the nearby Ivos Public School,”
Elizabeth explained seriously.
A public school wasn’t established and maintained by the
government. Instead, it was a school that accepted students from the
public. It was an evolution of good grammar schools whose goal was
to groom graduates so as to enter university. The schools were rather
expensive and they would consider the students’ family background.
It could even be out the of range of typical middle-class families.
She didn’t talk much. After choosing her food, she returned to
Selena’s side.
After congratulating the star of the day on a happy birthday, the
banquet gradually came to an end. Klein and Benson were invited to
a game of Texas hold’em. The small blind was half a penny, and the
big blind was a penny. As for Melissa, Elizabeth, Selena, and their
friends, they went upstairs. It was unknown if they were chatting or
playing games.
Klein’s luck was pretty bad. He played about twenty rounds, but
didn’t receive a good hand at all. All he could do was fold and be a
spectator.
When he ﬂipped the ends of his cards again, he found a Two of
Hearts and a Five of Spades.
“Shall I try a bluﬀ once?” Klein considered for a moment, but did not
manage to muster the courage. He also resisted the urge to use
divination to cheat.
He covered his cards and rapped the table, indicating that he was not
making a call. Then, he got up and left the table to head for the
bathroom.
Roselle was also a person with a obsessive-compulsive disorder. He
actually found an odd reason to name the play style Texas… Klein shook
his head as he proceeded forward.
At that moment, he suddenly came to a halt as his pupils constricted.
His spiritual perception told him that there was a strange ﬂuctuation
upstairs!
Chapter 85: Urgency
The strange, twisted, and obscure ﬂuctuation was short-lived. Shortly
afterwards, Klein even suspected that he was hallucinating.
If he wasn’t considered rather skilled at spiritual perception, it was
very likely that he would’ve written oﬀ the abnormality.
Klein frowned as he thought of his sister upstairs. He tightly held
onto his cane as he went around the bathroom and hobbled to the
Wood household’s staircase.
He quickly went upstairs while following the traces with his spiritual
perception before arriving at the living room beside the balcony.
This should be it… Klein mumbled as he raised his hand and tapped
twice on his glabella.
Auras penetrated the walls and the large wooden door before
entering his vision. Most of the colors were ordinary with a blurry
outline.
However, one of them in particular was rippling with a sinister dark
green color over its surface that slowly corroded inwards.
Just as I thought, something wasn’t right. Klein wore an usually stern
expression as he reached out with his right hand and removed the
silver chain which was wrapped around his left wrist.
He held the silver chain in his left hand, allowing the topaz to dangle
before him.
When the topaz stopped swinging, he traced the spherical light and
chanted inwardly, “The room before me has danger caused by the
supernatural.”
Normally, spirit dowsing was only suitable for divining something
that was related to him or the speciﬁc circumstances in a small
region around him. As such, Klein described the chant in very speciﬁc
manner—the ‘danger’ could aﬀect him and the room was right in
front of him.
…
“The room before me has danger caused by the supernatural.”
After repeating the chant seven times, Klein eyes widened as he saw
the topaz rotating in a clockwise motion rapidly.
It was an indication that there was indeed danger caused by the
supernatural inside the room, and it was of considerable danger!
Selena is a mysticism enthusiast. Did something go extremely wrong when
she was dabbling with some sort of ritual? What should I do? Klein
massaged his brows and wrapped the chain around his wrist before
knocking on the door.
Thump! Thump! Thump!
He knocked on the door three times rhythmically and wore an
amiable smile on his face.
The door opened with a creak. Melissa, who was wearing her new
dress, appeared in front of Klein.
“Klein, is something wrong?” The girl didn’t expect her brother to be
here, so she was momentarily surprised.
Klein responded with a smile, without any sign of distress.
“I was just curious since I heard you gals enjoying yourselves.”
“Sorry for disturbing all of you.” Melissa lowered her head in
apology, feeling somewhat embarrassed. “We’re playing with magic
mirror divination. Selena knows a lot and it’s very fun.”
Magic mirror divination… Sis, why don’t you gals play Charlie Charlie
challenge 1or Ouija boards 2 ? Klein shook his head, feeling both
peeved and amused.
He looked behind Melissa and into the living room. He saw Selena
with her beaming smile and deep dimples.
However, in his spirit vision, the wine-red haired girl, who was
holding a silver-coated mirror, was being encroached by the sinister
dark green colors.
As his mind whirled, Klein deliberated over his words and said, “Heh
heh, I won’t be interrupting your game. Ah, right. Where’s Elizabeth?
I had chatted with her over Feysac grammar. She mentioned that she
wanted to ask me some questions.”
“Elizabeth?” Melissa sized her brother up and said in an eccentric
tone to emphasize her words. “She’s only 16.”
Hey, don’t let your imagination go wild! Klein immediately explained,
“It’s a very normal academic discussion. Elizabeth is very interested
in history and ancient languages.”
Melissa took a deep look at her brother before saying, “She’s inside.
I’ll inform her.”
“Alright.” Klein took a step back and moved away from the door.
While watching his sister turn around, he heaved a sigh of relief.
Although it wasn’t the best of reactions, he was thankful that the
person in a danger wasn’t Melissa.
He only waited for about ten seconds before a puzzled Elizabeth
walked out. She asked curiously, “Mr. Moretti, what’s the matter? I
never said I was interested in history and ancient languages…”
At that moment, her sentence was halted by Klein’s stern and solemn
expression. Her nerves tightened as she seemed to sense that
something wasn’t right.
Klein took a few steps diagonally as a gesture for Elizabeth to hide
partially behind the door.
The girl with the chubby baby fat was inﬂuenced by the sudden
serious atmosphere so she unknowingly followed.
“As you know, I’m a mysticism enthusiast.” Klein halted and turned
around, speaking directly to the point.
Elizabeth nodded and replied, “Yes, I even believe that you’re an
expert at mysticism.”
“No, I’m only an enthusiast, but this doesn’t stop me from noticing
that your magic mirror divination has turned into a problem,” Klein
said with a heavy tone.
“A problem?” Elizabeth nearly raised her voice as she hurriedly
raised her hands to cover her mouth.
Klein thought for a moment before saying, “I know words alone will
make it diﬃcult for you to believe me. Return to the room and when
Selena isn’t paying attention, steal a glance at the front of the mirror
which Selena has hidden away from all of you.”
“How do you know that she hid the front of the mirror from us?”
Elizabeth blurted out.
According to the information from the Nighthawks, more than ninety
percent of the time, magic mirror divination cases which involve evil share
such similarities… Klein smiled and said, “General knowledge.”
When the doubtful and frightened Elizabeth returned to the room, his
composed smile vanished instantly. His face looked worried.
Even though we’re all in the North Borough, to go from Fania Street to
Zouteland Street will take at least 15 minutes of travel by public carriage.
By the time Captain arrives after making a round trip, the situation might
have deteriorated to a hopeless state… If only Benson and Melissa wasn’t
here… But I can’t deal with those hidden and unknown existences… Do I
have any means to contain it… Right, Selena is a mysticism enthusiast.
Her room deﬁnitely has no lack of pure dew, essential oils, herbs, and
other items…
Just as Klein was racking his brains for a solution, Elizabeth sat next
to Selena by using an excuse of discussing something with her.
A girl opposite her sipped a mouthful of red wine, and under the
teasing looks of everyone, despite her blushing, she mustered her
courage to ask, “Can you help me divine when I’ll meet a romantic
and handsome gentleman?”
Selena lightly coughed twice as she rubbed the mirror’s back and
said, “Mirror, mirror, tell me. When will the gentleman in Yonina’s
heart appear?”
After repeating it three times, she picked up the mirror and raised it
in front of her.
Seizing this opportunity, Elizabeth suddenly turned her body and
stretched out her head to take a glance.
According to her expectations, she felt that she would see Selena’s
face and half her face.
However, the only thing she saw was Selena.
The tiny mirror only had Selena, and it was Selena’s entire body!
The mirror was completely pitch-black, with Selena standing in the
middle with a cold expression!
Elizabeth trembled all over as she lunged backward and leaned
against the sofa. She momentarily forgot to breathe.
She involuntarily trembled and without giving an excuse, got up
immediately, stumbling to the door. She didn’t even dare to turn back
to look at the beaming Selena.
“Yonina’s gentleman will appear on the Sunday of the second week,
half a year later…”
Amidst giggles, Elizabeth opened the door and left the room to see
Klein who was standing in the shadows of the wall lamps in his
tuxedo and half top hat.
“Mr. Moretti, I-I…” she stammered in a daze.
Klein calmly smiled.
“Don’t disturb the girls and ladies inside.”
Infected by his smile, Elizabeth calmed down signiﬁcantly. She
extended her hand and closed the door as she quickly walked over to
the wall lamp.
“I saw it. I saw only Selena inside the mirror. A devil-like Selena…”
she whispered hoarsely.
Indeed… Klein’s expression turned serious as he asked in a deep
voice.
“Do you know which is Selena’s bedroom? Do you know where her
mysticism items are?”
“There. The mysticism items are in there as well.” Elizabeth didn’t
hesitate to point at a room diagonally across.
Klein held his cane and walked over, opening the unlocked wooden
door. Under the streetlights and the crimson moon’s illumination, he
turned a valve and lit a gas lamp.
A pale yellow light glowed as he swept the area and found bottles of
pure dew, ﬂower essence, boxes of herbal powder, candles and
amulets.
These items were placed on tables or neatly arranged inside a rack.
Their names were given on sticker labels.
After conﬁrming the items, Klein said to Elizabeth who had followed
behind him, “Do you want to save Selena?”
“Yes!” Elizabeth subconsciously nodded before asking in a daze, “Will
it be dangerous?”
“A certain amount. After all, I’m only a mysticism enthusiast,” Klein
replied frankly.
“A certain amount of danger…” Elizabeth pursed her lips tightly for a
few seconds before saying, “Is there anything you need from me?”
Klein smiled warmly as he comforted her, “Don’t be nervous. Now,
all you have to do is pretend to return as though nothing had
happened. Return to Selena’s side. Five minutes later—remember—
ﬁve minutes later, tell Selena that you have a pleasant surprise and
bring her to me. Knock on the door softly, one long knock and two
short ones. Following that, well—leave it to me.”
Elizabeth thought over it silently before nodding seriously.
“Alright.”
Seeing her return to the living room, Klein glanced at his pocket
watch. He closed Selena’s bedroom and quickly cleared the desk.
Then, he picked the items needed and placed them on a chair.
Immediately following that, he picked up two faint candles with a
light aroma. He placed them on the upper left and right corners of
the desk.
They were symbols representing the Lady of Crimson and the
Empress of Disaster and Horror.
Klein planned on holding a ritual here to borrow the Evernight
Goddess’s powers to ward oﬀ the mysterious and unknown existence
that was aﬀecting Selena!
As he was only a Sequence 9, the ritualistic magic he knew wasn’t
strong enough. In order to succeed, he needed Elizabeth to lure
Selena into a sealing circle, right in the vicinity of the altar!
Therefore, he needed to consider situations in which Selena might
notice and resist!
Due to these reasons, Klein planned on using suspension-style
ritualistic magic.
Chapter 86: Prayer
Suspension-style ritualistic magic referred to the termination of a
ritual according to the Beyonder’s judgment. They could ﬁnish other
matters ﬁrst before returning to continue the ritual. Even by doing so,
it was still possible to gain the desired eﬀects.
This was a technique produced over 1000 years of ritualistic magic
development. After all, many high-level ritualistic magic required
multiple steps. The duration ranged from an hour to half a day before
ﬁnishing. It was diﬃcult to ensure that no one disturbed them during
the entire process or that there wouldn’t be any accidents.
After gaining lessons from various predecessors through blood and
tears, gaining feedback through each failure, being able to suspend
ritualistic magic became mainstream at the higher levels while it also
indirectly aﬀected the lower level rituals.
However, being able to suspend a ritual didn’t mean that the ritual
could be suspended at any time. One had to abide by mysticism
theory and grasp the corresponding technique. If not, the failure of
the ritual was unavoidable. it could even result in a terrifying
backlash eﬀect.
Based on Klein’s understanding, once one gained the attention of a
particular divinity, and the divinity was waiting on the contents of
the request, to suddenly say, “Wait, I need to use the bathroom,” one
can only be congratulated since they might never need to go to the
bathroom ever again.
Phew… Klein heaved a sigh of relief as he composed himself.
Even though he had held many luck-enhancement rituals and had
even designed a corresponding ritual that made an attempt at Justice
and The Hanged Man, this was his ﬁrst actual ritualistic magic that
abided by the rules.
After looking at the silver-inlaid cane by the side of the bed, Klein
picked up the third candle and placed it in the middle of the desk to
represent himself.
He placed the silver bowl that Selena used for rituals in front of the
third candle and replaced the ax with a Sacred Emblem. On the left
were the pure dew and essential oils of the Moon ﬂower, Slumber
ﬂower, and other plants. While on the right, he placed a plate of salt,
a small silver dagger, a piece of fake goatskin, and a quill that was
dipped in ink.
Luckily, Selena had a complete inventory; otherwise, he wouldn’t
have had any way to complete the preparations. As for the
moderately fast rituals that Old Neil could perform, they were not
something a Seer could do…
From the looks of it, Selena was quite an experienced mysticism
enthusiast. Yes, if she wasn’t experienced then she wouldn’t have
gotten into such trouble… She was only 16 and had been exposed to
all of this for at least a year… Who had guided her? Ideas ﬂashed
through his mind as he picked up Selena’s cup from the bed. He
poured plain water into it and placed it beside the coarse salt.
He took out his pocket watch and popped it open. He didn’t delay
any further after taking a glance at it. He traced layers of the
spherical light in his mind and quickly entered meditation.
The room that was ﬁlled with ﬂoral fragrance, was suddenly subject
to a formless whirlwind. Klein put away his pocket watch and his
eyes suddenly turned darker, from brown to black, as though he
could see through one’s soul.
He extended his palm and laid it against the candle on the top right
corner. He chanted inwardly, “Evernight Goddess, you are the Lady
of Crimson!”
As Klein chanted, he extended his spirituality and rubbed the candle
wick. After a couple of moments, the candle suddenly lit up, and
there was a tranquil blue inside the dim yellow light.
“Evernight Goddess, you are the Empress of Disaster and Horror!”
Just like he did before, Klein successfully lit up the second candle on
the top left corner.
“I am your loyal guard; the shield that fends against danger in the
dark night, and the long spear that stabs at evil in the silence!”
Whoosh!
The third candle that symbolized Klein began to burn.
The ﬂame was still. He picked up the small silver knife and mimicked
Old Neil’s motions. He used incantations, coarse salt, and plain water
to fulﬁll the puriﬁcation.
Then, he let his spirituality that he had gathered spewed out from the
tip of the silver dagger, and naturally merged them as one.
With the silver knife in hand, Klein walked around the bedroom—
kneeling when he came to the bed—and sealed the area with a
formless barrier.
The light from the street lamp outside the window suddenly
disappeared, but the red light was still shining through quietly.
Klein returned to the study desk and picked up the quill. With
spirituality and ink, he drew incantations and symbols to ward oﬀ
disaster.
When all of that was ﬁnished, he put down the things he was
holding. Then, he trickled a drop of pure dew, ﬂower essence, and
essential oils on each of the three candles.
Sizzle!
A faint fog ﬁlled the room which suddenly possessed an additional
hint of mystery.
Next, he burned a few types of herbs before taking a step back from
the mixture of fragrances and began reciting the corresponding
incantation in the suspension ritualistic magic.
“Nobler than the stars and more eternal than eternity, the Evernight
Goddess.
“I pray for your loving grace.
“I pray for you to show your loving grace to a devout believer of
yours.
“I pray for the power of the Crimson.
“I pray for the powers of Disaster and Horror.
“I pray that you will cleanse your devout believer, Selena Wood, from
evil’s corruption and be safe from danger.
“I pray that you would wait for a moment, a moment for that
unfortunate girl.”
…
“Moon ﬂower, a herb that belongs to the red moon, please bestow
your powers to my incantation!
“Slumber ﬂower, a herb that belongs to the red moon, please bestow
your powers to my incantation!”
…
After reciting the incantation, Klein closed his eyes and repeated it
seven times in his heart.
He saw that there was nothing out of the ordinary at the altar. He
then lifted the silver dagger again and took a few steps back to the
door of Selena’s bedroom.
He tapped his chest in four spots, forming the shape of the crimson
moon. He then turned around and raised his silver dagger.
His spirituality spewed out from the tip once again and sliced open
the shape of a door in the formless wall.
Klein knew that even if he opened the door at that very moment, it
wouldn’t aﬀect the tranquility and holiness of the altar.
He took out his silver vine-leaf pocket watch that had a intricate
pattern. He checked the time and went through the process that was
to happen in a few moments.
…
In the living room on the second ﬂoor.
Elizabeth’s body was quivering as she lifted her head from time to
time to check the wall clock. She was counting down in silence under
the illumination of the two gas lamps.
“It’s almost time…” As she spoke softly, she looked sideways at the
lively girl with long wine-red hair. Her dimples were deep, her smile
was bright, and she gossiped well with all the friends around her.
But the more everything looked normal, the more terriﬁed Elizabeth
felt. The cold and horrifying Selena in the mirror seemed to be in her
head, and she couldn’t wipe the image away.
I can’t wait anymore! I have to take action now! Elizabeth suddenly
stood up. Before everyone’s shocked gazes, she smiled and stuttered,
“Selena, I-I have a surprise for y-you. Follow me out for a bit.”
“Really? Didn’t you give me a birthday present already?” Selena
ﬂipped the mirror the other way around and stood up in surprise.
“A surprise will n-not have any signs.” Elizabeth felt that she had no
talent in acting at all.
Without saying another word, she walked toward the bedroom door
ﬁrst. Selena followed behind with a confused smile.
Melissa looked at her two best friends leaving, and unconsciously
knitted her eyebrows.
Elizabeth is acting so strange today…
She started acting even stranger after she met Klein…
She suddenly ran out earlier and said that she needed to use the
bathroom, but why did she look so anxious?
…
Selena’s bedroom entrance.
Elizabeth took a deep breath and said to the girl in front of her, “Let’s
go to your room.”
“Elizabeth, you seem very nervous and afraid. Why?” Selena looked
puzzled at her good friend as she noticed her body trembling
constantly.
“Excitement! Yes, excitement!” Elizabeth shot a glance at the mirror
in Selena’s hand as she turned half her body around to knock on the
door with a long knock followed by two short successive ones.
“Why are you knocking on the door…” Selena was baﬄed even more.
Creak. Her bedroom door opened. Dressed in his black tuxedo and
half top hat, Klein appeared in front of the two girls.
“Pleasant surprise? This is a pleasant surprise?” Selena’s mouth
turned agape as she felt perplexed.
At that moment, Klein suddenly reached out his hand and grabbed
her by the wrist. He pulled her into the room as Elizabeth stood
rooted to the ground.
Simultaneously, Klein’s silver dagger struck forward as it spewed out
his spirituality which quickly mended the door-shaped passage.
The invisible spirituality wall sealed oﬀ the room, insulating Selena’s
screams within.
Bang!
Klein suddenly closed the door and without even looking at Selena,
he rushed to the desk.
The wine-red haired girl stopped screaming as she looked up and
surveyed the room.
Her gaze rapidly turned cold as her skin was mottled with paleness.
Her ﬁngers rapidly grew sharp ﬁngernails.
And at this moment, Klein had already returned to his Cogitation
state. He trickled a drop of Moon ﬂower and essential oil onto each
candle as he chanted loudly, “Supreme Lady of Crimson, Great
Empress of Disaster and Horror.
“I pray for you to bestow your loving grace.
“Show your loving grace to the lost lamb, Selena Wood!”
While chanting, he picked up the fake goatskin and pushed it onto
the candle representing the requester.
Whoosh!
He felt a cold wind blow behind him as an immense energy assaulted
his body.
The goat skin was ignited and Klein threw it into a silver bowl. Then,
he crouched downwards in accordance to his preparations to dodge
the lethal strike.
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
The wind howled ferociously, and Klein felt the uncontrolled outpour
of his spirituality surging like the currents.
He saw the goatskin burning in the tiny silver bowl, burning in silent
darkness, and he heard heavy items landing on the ground behind
him.
Bam! Bang!
The two sounds followed one after another with almost no breaks in
between. Wisps of dark green gases plunged into the silver bowl and
vanished into the illusory darkness.
Klein rolled to the side and got up. He drew his revolver from his
armpit holster. However, he saw that the adorable red-haired girl
Selena had fallen to the ground and the silver-coated mirror had
shattered into countless broken pieces on the carpet.
Those shattered pieces didn’t reﬂect Selena, but showed the ceiling
and Klein’s silhouette.
Then, through the Spirit Vision he had left active, Klein saw the
wicked dark green in Selena’s aura had vanished completely.
Everything returned to normal, but she seemed more frail.
Phew… He had just relaxed when he felt a sharp, throbbing pain in
his glabella and head.
The sharp pain spread all over his body and made him want to roll
around on the ﬂoor.
Klein held his ﬁsts tight, and the veins on the back of his hands
popped and became black. They looked like moving worms.
Simultaneously, he heard silent screams and the whispers that ripped
at his mind.
It took him nearly twenty seconds to survive the ordeal. His forehead
and vest was soaked in cold sweat.
The ritualistic magic I used sucked up all my spirituality and almost made
my Beyonder powers lose control? Klein made a rough guess of the
situation.
That also made him notice that he had digested quite a bit of the
remaining energy in the potion. Based on his calculations, if he had
the strength at the time he consumed the potion, he believed that
there was no way he could have survived the ordeal. He could have
become a monster straightaway.
“Acting” is quite eﬀective after all… Klein tapped his glabella and
wiped away his sweat.
He turned towards the altar, tapped his chest four times, and said out
loudly, “Praise the Lady!”
Following that, he extinguished the candles and quickly tidied up the
altar.
Finally, he placed the items back into the desk and used his silver
dagger to dispel the spirituality wall seal.
Whoosh!
The sound of the wind echoed before subsiding. Klein let out a long
sigh of relief and felt a sense of lingering fear.
“If I hadn’t walked through the process beforehand and successfully
completed the ritual then things would have become troublesome…
Besides, I still don’t know who my opponent or enemy is…
Thankfully—yes—thankfully, the room was carpeted, so I didn’t
damage my clothes while rolling…”
He shook his head and reached out to open the wooden door to
Selena’s bedroom.
“How was it?” Elizabeth took two steps back and asked nervously.
Klein looked at her terriﬁed expression and took oﬀ his half top hat
before saying with a warm smile, “I’ve already corrected the mistake
of her magic mirror divination. It’s been resolved now.”
Chapter 87: Exhortation
“Has it really been resolved?” Elizabeth asked in disbelief.
Klein smiled and nodded casually.
“Yes.”
“It wasn’t too hard.”
That last part was a lie… He added inwardly.
Perhaps it was the fact that Klein had been calm and collected all this
time, or perhaps he was her only ray of hope. Either way, Elizabeth
didn’t doubt him any more. She patted her chest and heaved a sigh of
relief.
“Thank you. You truly are a trustworthy gentleman. I was scared
senseless just now.
“How is Selena? Is she ﬁne now?”
“She might remain unconscious for the next few minutes, but she’s
completely ﬁne now. Oh, two to three days of weakness is to be
expected.” Klein suddenly had a stern expression on his face as he
asked, “Who taught her mysticism? Didn’t he tell her about the basic
taboos?”
Elizabeth straightened up a little more like a student who had just
been scolded by her teacher.
She thought for a moment before saying, “Selena once mentioned
that her teacher is Hanass Vincent. She met him a year ago at the
Divination Club on Howes Street.”
Hanass Vincent… On the surface, he didn’t seem to teach anything
questionable about magic mirror divination, but he secretly been teaching
dark divination… If I knew about this earlier, then I would have reported
it to Captain and have raided him earlier… Klein felt some regret as he
asked in a deep voice, “Was he also the one who taught Selena magic
mirror divination?”
Klein was left with a lingering sense of fear because this matter had
nearly aﬀected his sister — Melissa!
Elizabeth nodded cautiously.
“Yes, but Selena had tried magic mirror divination a few times
without any success. Oh, today she told me that she had a peek at her
teacher’s hidden incantations and that there would be no problems.”
She was basically an expert at courting death… Klein massaged his
temples to alleviate his headache.
“Do you still remember the incantations she recited?”
Well… Although Hanass Vincent had not voluntarily imparted the
dangerous knowledge to Selena, it’s obvious that he had been
experimenting with it to extend an invitation to a mysterious, unknown
entity. This would become a problem sooner or later. It has to be dealt
with quickly before it gets worse and becomes a problem for someone
else…
“I remember a part of it…” Elizabeth recalled. “She recited it in
Hermes. As you know, I was only exposed to Hermes just recently. All
I remember is her using the terms ‘revolve,’ ‘spirit,’ ‘Creator,’ and
‘grace.'”
Creator? The True Creator? Many underground mysticism enthusiasts
believe in this ancient entity revered by many secret organizations… Yes,
an entity that appeared 1000 years ago during the early stages of the Fifth
Epoch! Klein nodded amidst his thought and said, “Remember to ask
Selena about the entire incantation after she wakes up, then ﬁnd an
opportunity to tell me.”
“Alright,” Elizabeth replied without any reservations.
But she immediately asked, feeling a little confused, “Mr. Moretti,
why don’t you ask her yourself?”
“I don’t want to let Melissa know I enjoy mysticism. Can you help me
keep that a secret?” Klein asked in return.
Elizabeth bit her lips, her eyes sparkling.
“No problem. Melissa prefers machines to mystery. She likes logic
over instinct.”
Klein placed his hat in front of his chest and bowed gentlemanly.
“Thank you for your understanding. As for Selena, you do know that
she’s not someone who can keep a secret.”
“A more accurate description is that she likes to share secrets with
others,” Elizabeth agreed.
Klein put on his hat and thought for a moment before saying,
“Remember to tell Selena after she wakes up that she suddenly
fainted and shattered her mirror. I think her memory probably
stopped at the point when she began the magic mirror divination.”
Seeing Elizabeth nod, he put on a stern expression once again and
said, “Remember, be it divinations or trying other mysticism rituals,
do not pray to any other entities other than the seven orthodox
divinities! You should immediately burn those types of incantations
and stay far away from anyone distributing those materials!
“If I hadn’t noticed this in time, Selena would have turned into a
monster or an evil spirit in ten minutes, and everyone here would
have been killed, myself included!”
Thinking about the ice-cold Selena in the mirror, Elizabeth had no
doubts about what Klein had just said. She sighed with lingering fear
and said, “I understand and I’ll remember. I’ll also keep an eye on
Selena.”
“Alright, go and take care of Selena.” Klein raised his black cane and
walked toward the stairway.
As he walked, his eyes became darker. He took out a single penny
with his right hand and ﬂicked it into the air.
“Selena is alright now.
“Selena is alright now.”
…
Klein quickly repeated the description, then caught the falling coin.
He saw George III’s face facing upward.
This was not a simpliﬁcation of spirit dowsing. Instead, it was a
simpliﬁcation of dream divination. At that moment, Klein had forced
himself into a state of sleep with the aid of Cogitation in order to take
a tour through the spirit world. The heads and tails of the coin were a
symbolic manifestation.
Heads represented aﬃrmation, while tails indicated dissent!
Great, everything is ﬁne now… Klein twirled the bronze coin with his
ﬁngers happily.
That was a simpliﬁcation only a Seer could accomplish.
…
Elizabeth was staring at Klein’s back and saw the ﬂying coin before
he caught it.
Only when Klein vanished down the staircase did she turn to enter
the bedroom. She saw Selena asleep on the ﬂoor with shattered
pieces of the mirror beside her.
She held her breath and tiptoed into the room as she looked at the
fragments of the mirror. She made sure that the ice-cold Selena was
no longer present; instead, the fragments were reﬂecting the ceiling.
Phew. Put completely at ease, Melissa heaved a long sigh of relief.
But despite her eﬀorts, she couldn’t move Selena to the bed. Instead,
she nudged her awake.
“Elizabeth… What happened to me? Did I get drunk?” Selena asked
weakly, the glow in her eyes having turned considerably dull while
her eyes were ﬁlled with confusion.
Elizabeth thought for a moment and replied in a serious tone, “No,
Selena, something happened to you. Your magic mirror divination
invited a malicious entity.”
“Is that so?” Selena weakly made her way to the bed with Elizabeth’s
help. She rubbed her temple as she said, “All I remember is when I
started the magic mirror divination.”
Elizabeth told a half-truth, “You were a completely diﬀerent person
during the ritual. The you in the mirror was completely diﬀerent
from the you in real life… I was very scared. Using the excuse of
giving you a surprise, I brought you into the bedroom before I
snatched your mirror and shattered it onto the carpet. After that…
after that, you fainted.”
“Blessed be the Goddess, you’re okay now!”
“I-I don’t remember anything…” Selena muttered, her face pale.
The more Selena tried to remember, the emptier her mind became,
and the more afraid she felt.
Subconsciously, she glanced at her desk and noticed that the
placement of items was clearly diﬀerent.
Just what happened exactly… Selena tried hard to remember, but she
could only faintly remember a man in a black suit and hat. He was
not strong or tall, but he had a straight back.
“Selena,” Elizabeth said seriously, “I met a mysticism expert when I
went to the underground market to purchase the amulet. He said that
we shouldn’t pray to any entity other than the seven orthodox
divinities. Otherwise, we would be sure to invite disaster. Promise
me, don’t try this anymore. I didn’t even know if what I did could
save you just now!”
Selena was scared senseless. She nodded in a daze.
“No more, I’ll never try this again!”
“And, just what did the incantations of your mysticism mean? If I
have the chance to meet the mysticism expert again, I will ask him
for you,” Elizabeth asked, feigning nonchalance.
Selena rubbed her temple and said, “Spirit that revolves this world,
the grace of the True Creator, the eyes that look at fate.”
…
Tap! Tap! Tap!
Klein smoothed the creases and patted the dust oﬀ his clothes as he
walked down the stairs.
After that, he took oﬀ his hat and returned slowly to the long dining
table.
“Where did you go? It has been nearly 10 minutes,” Selena’s brother,
Chris, asked as he folded his hand.
Klein smiled and replied, “To the bathroom, then upstairs to acquaint
myself with the ladies.”
“I appreciate your honesty,” Chris praised in laughter.
He had the red hair and short build that ran in their family. He wore
gold-framed glasses and had quite the personality; he was an
exceptional lawyer.
You wouldn’t say that if you knew that I had knocked your sister
unconscious upstairs… Klein replied humbly, “We were merely
engaging in academic discussion.”
In the area of mysticism…
He put down his hat and returned to his seat. He received his two
cards as the new round started.
Flipping up the corner of his cards, he saw the King of Spades and the
Ace of Diamonds.
Looks like I became luckier… Is this payback for doing a good deed?
Klein took out a coin in preparation to place his bet.
Since Hanass didn’t intentionally reveal the incantation to Selena, there’s
no need for me to urgently report this to Captain…
He continued his cautious playstyle in the following rounds, only
betting when he had a good hand. He didn’t take any chances to bluﬀ
and didn’t win much. When the game ended at half past ten, he had
won six pence.
“I won two soli and eight pence.” Benson ﬁddled with the notes and
coins in his hand.
“I didn’t expect you to be an expert at poker,” Klein praised,
laughing.
“No, I don’t play often, but I know that this is the same as
negotiation. You have to hide your cards and ﬁgure out the hidden
cards that people have before using various means to scare or entice
them…” Benson hadn’t ﬁnished his sentence when he saw Melissa
and the rest coming down from the second ﬂoor.
“It’s time to go home,” said Klein as he glanced at his sister and her
friends while rubbing his temples.
The throbbing pain in his head remained.
After that, Klein went to the bathroom once more and took the
opportunity to walk past Elizabeth and obtained the complete
incantation.
Returning to his siblings, he smiled and said, “Oh right, I suddenly
remembered something. I need to head back to the company for a
while. Shall we go to Zouteland Street ﬁrst? It’ll be quick.”
Chapter 88: Report
“What is it?” Benson asked casually.
Melissa looked at her brother with a serious expression because she
felt that Klein’s behavior tonight was strange as well. In fact, it only
looked slightly more normal than Elizabeth’s behavior and, later,
Selena’s.
Klein chuckled as he had long thought of an excuse and said, “There
was a mistake in one of the document descriptions, and I already
informed my colleagues that I would hand it over to them when I
arrive early at the company tomorrow morning. So, I can either
amend it now since it’s on the way or wake up at least half an hour
earlier tomorrow morning. No doubt, I’ve chosen to do the former.”
“Ah, no wonder. I had a nagging feeling that your mind wasn’t in the
game, so you were actually thinking about work.” Benson smiled,
suddenly enlightened. “No, I apologize. I should say, the card game
helped you think.”
“Alright, we shall wait for you.” Melissa looked away and smoothed
out the ruﬄes of her engageantes.
As it was past the operation time for both track and trackless public
carriages, the three siblings bid their hosts farewell before hiring a
carriage nearby. It cost two soli for forty-ﬁve minutes.
“I’ve heard that every carriage driver that rents out their own
carriage adds ridiculous fees,” Benson complained in a low voice. He
had used most of the money that he won earlier to pay the driver.
Klein smiled and replied, “I think it’s very acceptable. After all, it is
almost eleven o’clock.”
“I was just joking. I thought that we could actually share the carriage
with other guests. Forty-ﬁve minutes can take us to many places.”
Benson looked out of the window at the other people who were
hiring carriages one after another.
I know, ride-sharing… Klein rubbed the top of his silver-inlaid cane
and said, “We don’t have a problem with that, but the other
customers might. Benson, did you notice that they care a lot about
their image and at looking respectable? I think that might be
common among the middle-class.”
“Hmm.” Benson nodded seriously and said, “The Wood family was
much more extravagant than I imagined. However, Wood’s weekly
salary is only four pounds per week… Heh, ‘looking respectable’
might be the biggest diﬀerence between the middle-class people and
curly-haired baboons.”
Do you have something against curly-haired baboons… Klein almost
burst out laughing.
Melissa didn’t join in on their discussion. She took a seat and sized up
Klein from time to time. Her gaze was sending chills down his spine.
The two-wheeled horse carriage was traveling quickly in the dark,
quiet street. They arrived at Zouteland Street in only twelve minutes.
“Wait for me here. Five minutes, it won’t be more than ﬁve minutes,”
Klein emphasized. He put on his top hat, grabbed his cane, and got
oﬀ the carriage.
As the carriage driver was charging based on time instead of distance,
the driver didn’t mind waiting.
Going up the stairs, Klein arrived at the Blackthorn Security Company
and knocked on the door.
Within ten seconds, the door was opened wide. Leonard Mitchell
appeared before him in a vest and shirt.
“You’re not on duty tonight,” Leonard pointed out, looking surprised
to see him.
Klein was only on guard duty once a week for the Chanis Gate. They
maintained a regular work schedule for the rest of the time. As for
emergencies that happened at night, they would be dealt with by the
Sleepless who enjoyed the night.
However, only getting two to three hours of sleep a day can cause
baldness and memory loss… Whenever he thought about this, Klein
couldn’t help but ridicule Captain Dunn Smith in his mind.
“I have something to report,” he answered simply.
“There’s a mission?” Leonard asked casually, moving aside.
When Klein entered the reception hall, he saw Dunn coming out in
his black windbreaker. His gray eyes were dark as usual.
“Captain, I came across an incident involving the supernatural.”
“Give me the details,” Dunn asked directly.
Klein recounted the whole story from earlier and reported the steps
that he took to deal with it.
“…So, I think there’s a need to investigate Hanass Vincent.”
Back then he believed that since the evil entity that was invited by
the magic mirror divination hadn’t caused a disaster, and there was
no indication that he was in extreme danger. That meant that the
entity probably still needed more time. It didn’t want to awaken or
possess Selena ahead of time; therefore, as long as its goals were not
exposed, the evil entity chose to observe the situation. Under such
circumstances, it wasn’t hard for Elizabeth to trick Selena to head to
the entrance of the bedroom.
“You’ve done well. You seized the opportunity before the evil spirit
fully materialized to possess her body completely.” Dunn lifted his
head lightly and said, “Let us take care of the follow-up
investigations. You can return home to rest.”
Klein heaved a sigh of relief and chortled.
“I thought you would make this my initiation mission and make me
complete it alone.”
From the incantation that Elizabeth provided him, Hanass Vincent
was certainly dangerous…
“That’s because there’s already an initiation mission for you.” The
desultory Leonard chuckled by the side.
“What?” Klein was shocked.
Dunn smirked and explained with his soothing voice, “At around
seven tonight, the police station referred us to a case. From our initial
assessments, there doesn’t seem to be any danger or urgency, so it
was decided that you would complete it on your own tomorrow.”
“Alright, don’t ask about the case. Rest well tonight and move your
day oﬀ to Tuesday or Wednesday.”
Captain, doing that only aﬀects my sleep… Plus, Monday afternoon is
when the Tarot Gathering takes place… Do I need to send a
postponement notiﬁcation to Justice and The Hanged Man? Klein
shook his head and smiled bitterly. He then bade farewell and left.
Exiting the stairway, he suddenly sensed something. He lifted his
head to look towards the carriage that they had hired. He only saw
Melissa looking at him silently through the window.
When they made eye contact, Melissa suddenly looked away and sat
properly.
The corner of Klein’s mouth twitched, and he got into the carriage,
pretending nothing had happened.
Under the crimson moon and pure night sky, the carriage moved
quickly down one street after the other.
When they returned home, Klein yielded the bathroom to Benson for
his shower while he went to Melissa’s bedroom and knocked twice.
Melissa, who was planning to use the other bathroom, opened the
door and looked at her brother suspiciously.
“Melissa, do you have any questions that you’d like to ask? I know
you do,” Klein asked straightforwardly.
Don’t just observe me in silence…
Melissa lips trembled and creased her eyebrows as she spoke.
“Klein, what did you do to Elizabeth? She seemed a bit oﬀ.”
“And, later on, Selena started acting very strange too.”
Klein had prepared his reply.
“Do you know that Elizabeth and Selena are mysticism enthusiasts?”
“…Yeah, but I don’t like it. I don’t think there’s anything that can’t be
explained in this world,” Melissa answered seriously after being
momentarily taken aback. “Anything that seems unexplainable is due
to the fact that the knowledge we have grasped is insuﬃcient.”
“Yeah, I think so too,” Klein echoed her sentiments guiltily.
I once thought so too, until I successfully courted death…
He coughed lightly and continued, “Mysticism involves Hermes, the
language used speciﬁcally for ancient worship ceremonies and
prayers. Elizabeth knew that I am good at it. Heh, it is within a
historian’s domain after all. So, she asked me about the
pronunciation of corresponding words and their actual meanings.”
Melissa nodded lightly, signifying her acceptance of her brother’s
explanation. It went according to her understanding of both parties.
“As for why Elizabeth and Selena became weird later on, I have no
idea about the actual reasons.” Klein removed himself from the
picture ﬁrst, then he said, “But, I can make a guess.”
“You managed to guess it?” Melissa blurted out in shock.
Klein lifted his hand and patted his lips.
“I could guess from the contents of what Elizabeth asked. The few
Hermes words were related to divination, as well as the worshiping
of evil entities. Yes, when Selena did the magic mirror divination, did
she recite in Hermes?”
He proactively brought that up in order to remind his sister to keep
her guard up against similar situations. It would be even better if she
could cut oﬀ contact with Selena and Elizabeth.
“Yes…” Melissa replied after a delay. “I think I understand why
Elizabeth and Selena were acting strange…”
Then, Klein asked deliberately, “As Selena’s magic mirror divination
involved a wicked, illegal belief, perhaps Elizabeth found an
opportunity to criticize and correct Selena’s mistake after she
clariﬁed with me the actual meaning of the Hermes that Selena had
used?”
“I think so,” Melissa didn’t doubt this conclusion because she had
made the same deduction herself.
Klein let out a breath of relief upon seeing that he had successfully
directed the ﬂow of the conversation.
“In the future, it’s best if you advised Selena to put her beliefs in the
orthodox.”
Then, he tapped four spots on his chest just like a priest.
“Yes, I will!” Melissa replied, sounding determined.
“And, don’t tell Elizabeth and Selena about our deduction or about
the things that I’ve said. I actually promised Elizabeth not to tell
you,” Klein emphasized.
“Okay.” Melissa nodded lightly.
…
On Monday morning at eight, in the Blackthorn Security Company.
Klein took oﬀ his hat and greeted Rozanne and Bredt. After
exchanging a few words, he entered Captain Dunn Smith’s oﬃce.
He pushed the door open and looked around. He suddenly had a
shock, because Dunn’s face was pretty pale and his gray eyes looked
clouded, without their usual darkness.
“What happened? Hanass Vincent?” Klein asked in concern and
shock.
Dunn rubbed his forehead, took a sip of coﬀee, and replied with a
bitter smile, “Hanass Vincent is dead.”
“Who killed him ahead of time?” Klein sat before Dunn with his cane
in hand.
Dunn didn’t answer immediately but sighed and said, “Leonard and I
went to look for Hanass Vincent last night. As his usual behavior
didn’t show any unusual signs and there was nothing odd about his
house, I decided to enter his dreams to look for clues.”
“In his dream, in his dream…”
His eyes showed fear as Dunn repeated himself twice, that was when
he said, “In his dream, I saw a cross, a huge cross, one that blotted
out the sky. On the huge cross there was a naked man nailed to it
with black nails. His arms and legs were pinned with his arms
extended outwards. He was hung upside down, his head hung low
like a chandelier. There was strips of blood stains on his body.”
“Upon seeing such a scene, I lost consciousness. I left Hanass
Vincent’s dream, and when I woke up, Leonard told me that Hanass
had died in his sleep.”
“Huge cross, hung upside down, the man covered in blood stains…
It’s similar to some of the stories of the True Creator that some of the
hidden organizations believe in, but there are considerable
diﬀerences too…” Klein made a deduction in suspicion.
The few hidden organizations that believed in the True Creator had
only appeared in the last two or three centuries, such as the Aurora
Order and the Iron and Blood Cross Order. However, similar such
depictions had never disappeared over the past thousand plus years.
Dunn rubbed his forehead again. “We’ll follow-up on this. As for you,
go ahead and complete your initiation mission ﬁrst.”
Chapter 89: A Simple Mission
Klein nodded and said, “Alright, but I still don’t know what my
mission is.”
“Nothing dangerous. I haven’t seen any signs of danger at the very
least,” Dunn emphasized. “This is a case which was referred to us by
Golden Indus’s police department. The famous philanthropist Sir
Deweyville has been experiencing unusual harassment over the past
month. Be it his bodyguards, the security guards he has employed, or
the police, none of them have been able to ﬁnd the culprit. Inspector
Tolle, who is in charge of this case, suspects that it involves Beyonder
powers and, thus, handed the case over to us.”
I saw Sir Deweyville at the library the other day and noticed that he
was feeling down and lethargic. So it was a result of being harassed…
Klein knitted his brows and asked, “What kind of harassment is it?”
There hasn’t been any physical harm inﬂicted yet; thus, the
harassment wouldn’t be considered dangerous.
“Sir Deweyville hears moans and cries every night, no matter where
he is, be it Tingen or not. This has aﬀected his sleep quality
negatively.” Dunn ﬂipped the notes in his hands. “He has seen a
psychiatrist and has asked his butlers and servants to conﬁrm that it
was not an illusion. Having conﬁrmed that it isn’t a hallucination,
thus, it is suspected that someone is harassing him.”
Closing the ﬁle, Dunn looked up at Klein.
“Change into your probationary inspector uniform in the break room,
then meet Inspector Tolle who is in charge of this case at the
Shooting Club. He’ll provide you with more details.”
“Probationary inspector uniform?” Klein asked instinctively.
Dunn rubbed his forehead and smiled.
“Half of our salary comes from the police department, and the title of
probationary inspector doesn’t merely belong in the records. When
you met Leonard and I for the ﬁrst time, we were also wearing
uniforms. This is a perk held by fully oﬃcial members. Yes, the
‘Perks’ as Emperor Roselle would call it.”
Unfortunately, I can’t wear it as a casual outﬁt. Otherwise, I’d be able
to have another spare outﬁt when my clothes are being washed…
Klein picked up his cane and bade farewell before leaving the
captain’s oﬃce.
He headed toward the break room and saw a black and white
checkered uniform, complete with leather boots, placed on the table.
The uniform’s peak cap was embroidered with the logo of the police
department—two crossed swords and a crown. Located on the
shoulder was a black and white epaulet with a shimmering silver
star.
“This is a probationary inspector uniform?” Klein glanced at the
uniform and noticed a string of numbers under the silver stars:
06-254.
He had some understanding of the police rank structure in the Loen
Kingdom. He knew that those at the top were the minister and the
chief secretary of the police force. Under them were the respective
commissioners, deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners of the
various police departments. Those in the middle were
superintendents and inspectors, while those at the very bottom were
the sergeants and constables.
After closing the door, Klein took oﬀ his suit and hat before changing
into the uniform.
He hung his suit up and left the room. He made his way into the
clerk’s oﬃce and looked at himself using the full-body mirror that
Rozanne brought to him.
The young man in the mirror had black hair with gentle brown eyes.
The uniform on his body accentuated him with a heroic spirit.
“Not bad.” Klein praised himself narcissistically. He left his cane in
the oﬃce and left the Blackthorn Security Company.
Inside his pockets were a full set of equipment, ranging from
weapons to his police badge.
…
At the hall of the Shooting Club.
Klein met Inspector Tolle immediately since he was the only one in a
police uniform.
Of course, there’s me too… Klein thought.
There were two silver stars on the epaulets of Inspector Tolle’s
uniform. His clothes were propped up by his stomach and he had a
thick blond mustache. His frame was tall but not imposing. Perhaps,
it was imposing in the past.
“Moretti? Klein Moretti?” Inspector Tolle noticed Klein and
welcomed him with a smile.
“Hello, Inspector Tolle, I believe that you have the right person,”
Klein replied amicably, then following his memories, he raised his
right arm, kept his ﬁngers straight and tight before saluting.
Tolle chuckled.
“I can tell that you’ll be a young man who’s easy to get along with.
That’s good. Shall we head to Sir Deweyville’s place now?”
Even though he was a higher rank than Klein, the tone in his query
was obviously friendly.
“No problem.” Klein thought for a moment before he said, “You can
ﬁll me in on the details of the case on the carriage.”
“Sure.” Tolle stroked his thick blond beard and guided Klein out of
the Shooting Club. They boarded a carriage which was stopped on
the other side of the road.
There was the “two crossed swords and a crown” police emblem on
the carriage, and it came with a personal carriage driver.
“Sir Deweyville is a believer of the Goddess, so we referred the case
to you,” Tolle said quickly as he sat down.
“I know. The ﬁne knight is a common ﬁgure on the covers of
newspapers and magazines.” Klein ﬂashed a friendly smile.
Tolle picked up the document docket beside him and removed the
seal before taking out the materials inside. As he ﬂipped through
them, he explained, “Regardless, even if you are aware of it, I need to
provide you with the detailed brieﬁng.
“Sir Deweyville is one of the richest tycoons of Tingen City. He built
his career beginning with a lead and porcelain factory. It has now
expanded to steel, coal, shipping, banking, and bonds. He is also a
great philanthropist that has been praised by the king, having set up
the Deweyville Charity Foundation, the Deweyville Trust, and the
Deweyville Library… He was also knighted ﬁve years ago… If he
were willing to run for mayor, I don’t think anyone in Tingen City
could contest with him.
“But Backlund is his goal; he wants to become a member of
parliament. We once suspected that the harassment might be related
to this, but we have no clues to this date.”
Klein nodded slightly and said, “We can’t rule out that possibility, but
there’s nothing to conﬁrm that suspicion as of now.”
Tolle didn’t dwell on this point. He continued, “From the sixth of last
month, Sir Deweyville has heard painful skin-numbing moans every
night when he sleeps, akin to a patient’s ﬁght for his life. He has
checked the surrounding rooms multiple times, but he hasn’t found
anything unusual. His butler and servants have also conﬁrmed that
they heard such sounds, but it is simply softer for them.
“In the beginning, Sir Deweyville believed that this matter would
pass quickly and didn’t pay too much attention to it. But the moans
became more and more frequent, to the point of occasionally
happening during the day. There was even the addition of heart-
wrenching cries.”
“This has made Sir Deweyville lose sleep, time and time again he had
no choice but to leave Tingen to his villa in the villages. But it was to
no avail. The moans and cries persisted. Similarly, the phenomenon
persisted even in Backlund, just that it wasn’t as serious.
“He employed security guards to check his surroundings, but they
didn’t ﬁnd any clues. Our preliminary investigations also came up
with nothing.
“Sir Deweyville, who has been tortured for more than a month, is on
the brink of collapse. He visited psychiatrists time and time again but
was unable to have his problems resolved. He told us that if this
problem was not solved within a month, he would leave Tingen and
head to Backlund. He believes that there would be people who can
help him there.”
After listening to Tolle’s explanation, Klein quickly analyzed and
came up with a few possibilities.
He oﬀended a Beyonder and is suﬀering from a curse?
No, if he was suﬀering from a curse, the butlers and servants in his
house wouldn’t hear the same things…
There’s a Beyonder with unknown motives hidden among his servants
and bodyguards?
But the problem stems from the point that there has been no requests
made of Sir Deweyville over the past month…
Perhaps Sir Deweyville accidentally came into contact with some
vengeful evil spirit?
That possibility cannot be ruled out…
The carriage entered the Golden Indus borough while Klein was still
deep in thought. It stopped at the door of Sir Deweyville’s house.
A steel fence surrounded a lush garden. There were two statues by
the side of the hollowed metal gates, a magniﬁcent fountain that
showered a marble sculpture with water, an expansive two-story
building, as well as a path wide enough to ﬁt three carriages.
“Even the knight’s house is only two stories high… The newspaper
reported that Backlund is experimenting with building ten-story
apartments…” Klein got oﬀ the carriage and saw a sergeant with
three chevron stripes walking over briskly.
He looked at Klein and saluted.
“Good morning, Sir!”
“Good morning.” Klein nodded with a smile.
Tolle smiled.
“This is Sergeant Gate, you can tell him if you need anything.
“This is Probationary inspector Moretti, a history and psychological
expert from the police department,” Tolle introduced Klein to Gate.
…I don’t deserve such a title… Klein felt a little embarrassed.
After the greetings, Gate pointed to the two-story building behind the
fountain and said, “Sir Deweyville is waiting for us.”
“Alright.” Klein caressed the revolver at his waist.
That was his best bet against an enemy.
Since he was in police uniform, he could put his revolver in a holster
at his hip, making it easier to draw it.
As they spoke, the trio made their way down the path, around the
fountain, and arrived outside the door.
By then, the door was already opened by a servant who was waiting
politely at the side.
As Klein pretended to adjust his hat, he tapped twice on his glabella
to activate his Spirit Vision before entering the house.
The square-faced Sir Deweyville was massaging his forehead in the
hall. He was clearly in low spirits. His blond hair and blue eyes were
either dry or dull as though he had aged considerably by at least ﬁve
years.
“Good morning, Sir Deweyville.” Klein, Tolle, and Gate bowed at the
same time.
Sir Deweyville stood up and forced out a smile.
“Good morning, Oﬃcers. I hope that you can resolve what has been
causing me distress.”
At that moment, Klein squinted and slightly knitted his brows.
Other than his low spirits, Klein couldn’t ﬁnd any other problems
with Sir Deweyville.
That’s odd… He thought for a moment before he said, “Sir, in which
room did you ﬁrst hear the moans?”
“My bedroom.” Sir Deweyville shook his head.
“Can we take a look?” inquired Klein.
“Haven’t you checked it many times?” the middle-aged butler
interrupted from the side.
It was clear that he didn’t notice that Klein was the partner of the
kind-hearted soul that had “not pocketed the money that he picked
up.”
Klein smiled, composed.
“Those were my colleagues, not me.”
“Sir, this is an expert sent by the police agency,” Tolle said, taking
the opportunity to introduce him.
Deweyville looked at the young expert and said, “Alright, Cullen,
take him to my room.”
“Sir, I hope that you will come with us,” Klein said seriously.
Deweyville hesitated for a few seconds before saying, “If that can
solve the problem…”
He grabbed his cane as he spoke. He made his way feebly toward the
staircase with the butler Cullen and several guards beside him, ready
to support him if needed.
Klein surveyed the surroundings as he followed behind them silently.
One step, two steps, three steps… They arrived at the second story
and entered the master bedroom.
Klein didn’t have the time to survey the surroundings when the hair
on his body stood on their ends.
This was feedback from his spiritual perception!
Chapter 90: Findings By Sight
Sir Deweyville’s bedroom was larger than the living room and dining
room of Klein’s house combined. It was partitioned into a place for a
bed, a living space, a changing room, a bathroom, and a study desk
and bookshelves. The furnishings were exquisite, and the details were
extravagant.
But to Klein, the light seemed dimmer and the temperature was
several degrees colder than the outside.
At the same time, he seemed to hear the sound of sobbing and
moaning, as though one was putting up a last-ditch struggle.
Klein was in a trance, and everything suddenly returned to normal.
The sunlight shone brightly through the window and poured over the
entire bedroom. The temperature was reasonable, neither too high
nor low. The surrounding policemen, bodyguards, and butler were
quiet. No one spoke.
This… He looked sideways at the classic yet luxurious bed. He felt
there were pairs of blurry eyes lingering in the shadow, like the
moths that fearlessly stayed around gas lamps.
Taking a few steps closer, Klein lost the earlier images from his Spirit
Vision.
Not a standard wraith or an evil spirit… What is it exactly? Klein
frowned and recalled the mysticism knowledge that he had been
learning all this time.
From what he had seen, the mission would have been easy if it was
passed to a Corpse Collector, Gravedigger, or Spirit Medium. It was
obviously not within his domain of expertise.
Holding back his urge to use divination as an investigative approach,
Klein looked around slowly to look for other traces to conﬁrm the
few guesses on his mind.
“Inspector.” Sir Deweyville hesitated and asked, “Did you discover
anything?”
“If it were that easy, I believe my colleagues wouldn’t have waited
until now,” Klein replied, glancing at the philanthropist
subconsciously.
Just as he planned to retract his gaze, he suddenly saw that there was
a faint white human ﬁgure reﬂected behind Sir Deweyville in the
mirror behind him.
No, there were many ﬁgures overlapping each other, resulting in a
white distorted ﬁgure!
The ﬁgure ﬂashed by and Klein seemed to hear faint sobbing.
Phew… He let out a breath to ease his nerves, having almost drawn
his gun out out of fright.
Heightened spiritual perception with Spirit Vision will one day scare
me senseless… Klein tried relaxing his tense nerves by joking around
before redirecting his focus back onto Sir Deweyville.
This time, he saw something diﬀerent.
Now that he was in the bedroom, Sir Deweyville had a faint and
twisted ﬁgure shimmering around him. It even dimmed the lighting
of that area.
Every ﬂash was accompanied by an illusionary cry and moan that
could hardly be detected by an ordinary person.
Hardly audible for an ordinary person under ordinary circumstances?
Is it because it’s daytime? Klein nodded as he thought.
He had an initial judgment for this case.
It was resentment that was haunting Sir Deweyville. It was the
remnant spirituality that resulted from unresolved emotions before a
human’s death!
If such feelings of resentment stayed in this world over a period of
time, they would become a terrifying wrathful spirit after becoming
stronger.
However, Sir Deweyville was a famous philanthropist. Even Benson,
who was a picky person, was in awe of him. Why would he be
bogged down with the resentment of the dead? Is he actually two-
faced? Could it be the means of a Beyonder with nefarious
intentions? Klein guessed the possibilities suspiciously.
After some thought, he looked towards Deweyville and asked,
“Honorable Sir, I have a few questions.”
“Please ask.” Deweyville sat down wearily.
Klein organized his thoughts and asked, “When you leave here to go
to a new place, such as the village or Backlund, do you temporarily
get at least half a night’s worth of peace before the situation resumes
and gradually worsens? Even when you sleep during the daytime, are
you able to hear moaning and sobbing sounds?”
Deweyville’s half-closed eyes suddenly widened as his deep blue eyes
were suddenly beaming with hope.
“Yes, did you ﬁnd the root of the problem?”
Only then did he realize that due to his extended period of insomnia
and his poor mental state, he had completely forgotten to inform the
police about such an important clue!
Seeing that Klein’s question had uncovered something useful,
Inspector Tolle relaxed. He knew that the Nighthawk had found a
clue.
Sergeant Gate was surprised and curious too. He couldn’t help but
look closely at the psychological expert, Klein.
It coincided with the traits of gradual entanglement and the feature
of accumulation… Having received the feedback, Klein had basically
conﬁrmed the cause.
Then, he had two ways of helping Sir Deweyville to shake oﬀ the
burden. One was to set up an altar directly around the man and
remove the resentment of the dead entirely using ritualistic magic.
The second option was to use other mysticism measures to ﬁnd the
root of the problem and solve it from there.
Taking into consideration the rule of preventing commoners from
learning of Beyonder powers to the best of his abilities, Klein planned
on ﬁrst attempting the second method. Only if it failed would he pray
to the Goddess.
“Sir, yours is a psychological illness, a mental problem,” he spoke
nonsense with absolute seriousness while looking at Deweyville.
Sir Deweyville knitted his brows and asked in reply, “Are you telling
me that I’m a mental patient, that I need to enter an asylum?”
“No, nothing that serious. Actually, most people have psychological
problems to one degree or another,” Klein casually comforted him.
“Please allow me to introduce myself again. I am a psychological
expert from the Awwa County Police.”
“Psychological expert?” Deweyville and his butler looked at Inspector
Tolle who they were familiar with.
Tolle nodded seriously and conﬁrmed that it was true.
“Alright, what do you need of me for my treatment? Besides, I don’t
understand why my butler, my bodyguards, and my servants will
hear the sobbing and moaning as well…” Deweyville held his
walking stick with both hands, looking confused.
Klein replied professionally, “I will explain it to you after it’s
resolved.”
“Please tell your butler, your servants, and your bodyguards to leave.
Inspector Tolle, Sergeant Gate, please leave as well. I need a quiet
environment to begin the initial treatment.”
A “treatment” with magic… Inspector Tolle added in his heart and
nodded at Sir Deweyville.
Deweyville fell silent for more than ten seconds before saying,
“Cullen, take them to the living room on the second ﬂoor.”
“Yes, Sir.” Butler Cullen didn’t retort since the request was made by a
police oﬃcer, a probationary inspector, and a psychological expert.
After watching them leave the room one after another and closing the
door behind them, Klein looked at Deweyville who had dark blond
hair and blue eyes, and said, “Sir, please lie down on your bed. Relax
and try to sleep.”
“…Alright.” Deweyville hung his coat and hat on the clothes rack
before walking slowly to the side of the bed and then laid down.
Klein drew all the curtains, turning the room dark.
He took oﬀ his pendant and quickly used spirit pendulum to
determine any dangers. Then, he sat on the rocking chair near the
end of the bed, traced a spherical light in his mind, and entered
Cogitation. He allowed the world of spirituality to extend before his
eyes.
Then, he leaned against the back of the chair and fell into a deep
sleep, allowing for his Astral Projection to make contact with the
external world.
He was using the technique of dream divination, to let himself be in
the spiritual environment like he was dreaming, so as to
communicate with each and every resentment that plagued Sir
Deweyville.
Only communication would be able to give him an answer and solve
the problem!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
A sad sob reverberated in Klein’s ear, and he “saw” that the white
translucent ﬁgures were ﬂoating around him.
A painful groan echoed as Klein, who barely regained his mental
processes, extended his right hand and touched one of them.
Suddenly, the ﬁgures swarmed at him like moths darting toward a
ﬁre.
The image before Klein’s eyes suddenly turned blurry and his brain
seemed to be cleaved into two. Half of his mind was calmly observing
while the other half saw a “mirror.”
In the “mirror,” there was a young girl dressed in worker garbs. She
looked strong and ﬁt as she walked in a dust-covered factory while
her head throbbed in pain.
Her eyesight occasionally turned blurry and her body became
skinnier by the day.
She seemed to hear someone calling her Charlotte, and the voice said
that she had a hysterical illness.
Hysterical illness? She looked towards the mirror and saw that she
had a faint blue line on her gum.
…
The “mirror’s view” switched and Klein saw another girl called Mary.
She too walked into the lead factory, young and lively.
Suddenly, half of her face started twitching, followed by her arm and
leg on the same side.
“You have epilepsy.” She heard someone say while her whole body
was convulsing.
As she twitched and fell, the intensity increased before she ﬁnally lost
consciousness.
…
There was another girl, and she was depressed. She was walking
around the street in a daze, to the point of having a speech
impediment.
She had a very bad headache, and she had a blue line on her gums.
She would also convulse from time to time.
She met a doctor, and the doctor said, “Lafayette, this is a result of
lead poisoning.”
The doctor looked at her with pity and saw her convulse again. She
twitched continuously, and the doctor saw that her eyes had lost all
their light.
…
Many images appeared before Klein, and he remained immersed
within them and calmly observed.
Suddenly, he understood the plight of the girls <sup>1</sup> .
The female workers had been in extended contact with white lead.
They had all died of lead poisoning as a result of long-term exposure
to the dust and powder.
Sir Deweyville had a lead factory under his name and also two
porcelain factories. All of them hired comparatively cheaper female
workers!
Klein “saw” all of that in silence, and felt that there was something
that still had not been clariﬁed.
Such “death resentment” was insigniﬁcant. They could not aﬀect
reality or have any eﬀect on Deweyville even when accumulated.
Unless— Unless there was a more powerful and stubborn resentment
that had united them all.
Just then, he “saw” another girl.
The girl was no more than 18 years old, but she was glazing the
porcelain in the factory.
“Hayley, how are you doing lately? Do you still have a headache? If
it gets too serious, remember to inform me. Sir Deweyville has
enforced a rule that people with severe headaches cannot continue
being in contact with lead and must leave the factory,” an elder lady
asked with concern.
Hayley touched her forehead and replied with a smile, “Just a little,
I’m okay.”
“Tell me tomorrow if it gets any worse,” the elderly lady exhorted.
Hayley agreed. When she returned home, she massaged her forehead
from time to time.
She saw that her parents and brothers had returned, but their faces
looked hopeless.
“Your father and brothers lost their jobs…” her mother said as she
wiped her tears.
Her father and brother hung their heads low and muttered, “We will
try to get some work at the harbor.”
“But we don’t even have bread money for the day after tomorrow…
Maybe we will need to move to Lower Street…” Hayley’s mother
looked at her with reddened eyes. “When are you getting your pay?
It’s ten soli, right?”
Hayley massaged her forehead again.
“Yeah, Saturday. Saturday.”
She didn’t say anything else and remained as quiet as usual. She
returned to the factory the next day and told her supervisor that her
headache recovered and she felt ﬁne.
She smiled and walked ﬁve kilometers back and fro to work daily.
She massaged her head more and more frequently.
“You haven’t found another job?” Hayley couldn’t help but ask her
father and brother while looking at the soup which was boiling with
black bread.
Her father said in frustration, “The economy is in a recession. Many
places are retrenching. Even the harbor jobs are sporadic. I could
only get three soli and seven pence a week.”
Hayley sighed and fell into her usual silence. However, she hid her
left hand that was twitching suddenly.
On the second day, she walked to work again. The sun was shining
brightly, and the street grew busier and busier with pedestrians.
Suddenly, she started convulsing all over.
She fell to the side of the road, foam spewing out of her mouth.
She looked up into the sky and her gaze turned into a blur. She saw
people walking past and others getting close. She saw a carriage pass
by with the Deweyville family emblem with a white dove with its
spread wings as if ready to take oﬀ.
She tried hard to open her mouth, but she couldn’t make a sound.
So, she didn’t say a thing, quiet as ever.
But the diﬀerence this time was that she was dead.
Chapter 91: Solution
The scenery started to distort, turning illusory and began to fade
away.
After Klein left his dreamlike state, his vision adapted to the darkness
in the room.
He knew that with one pound and ten soli, which was thirty soli a
week, Benson didn’t have an easy time supporting the family
according to the standards of an average family.
He had thought that the majority of workers earned twenty soli a
week.
He had once heard Melissa remark that Lower Street of Iron Cross
Street had ﬁve, seven, or even ten families squeezing into the same
room.
He also learned from Benson that as a result of the situation in the
Southern Continent, the kingdom’s economy was in a recession for
the past few months.
He knew that a maid, with board and lodging provided, could earn
between three soli and sixpence to six soli a week.
Klein extended his hand and pinched his glabella. He was silent for a
long time, until Sir Deweyville asked, “Oﬃcer, aren’t you going to
say anything? The psychiatrists I went to would always speak to me
and ask questions in such a situation.
“However, I must say that I feel at peace. I almost fell asleep. I
haven’t heard any moans or cries yet.
“How did you do it?”
Klein leaned back in the rocking chair. Instead of providing an
answer, he asked with a gentle tone, “Sir, do you know about lead
poisoning? Do you know about the dangers of lead?”
Deweyville fell silent for a few seconds. “I did not know about it in
the past, but I do now. Are you telling me that my psychological
illness stems from my guilt—my guilt toward the female lead and
porcelain factory workers?”
Without waiting for Klein to answer, he continued just like he always
had—in his position of power during a negotiation.
“Yes, I did feel guilty about this in the past, but I did compensate
them. At my lead and porcelain factories, the workers do not earn
less than other workers in the same industry. In Backlund, lead and
porcelain workers are paid no more than eight soli a week, but I pay
them ten, sometimes even more.
“Heh, many people criticize me for breaking ranks since it makes it
hard for them to recruit workers. If not for the Grain Act that made
many farmers bankrupt, sending them to the cities, they would have
had to raise their wages just like I did.
“Furthermore, I’ve also informed the supervisor of the factories to
make sure that those with repeated headaches and blurry vision are
to leave the areas where they are exposed to lead. If their illness is
really severe, then they can even ask for help at my charity
foundation.
“I think I have done enough.”
Klein spoke without a ripple of emotion in his voice, “Sir, at times,
you cannot imagine how important a salary is to a poor person.
Simply losing work for a week or two can result in an irreversible loss
to their family, a loss that would cause tremendous grief.”
He paused before saying, “I am curious, why wouldn’t a kind person
like you install equipment that can protect against dust and lead
poisoning in your factories?”
Deweyville looked at the ceiling and laughed ruefully.
“That would make my costs too high for me to bear. I would no
longer be able to compete with other lead and porcelain companies. I
no longer pay too much attention to my proﬁts in these areas of my
business. In fact, I am even willing to fork out some money. But
what’s the point of keeping the business if I have to keep doing that?
That can only help a number of workers and not become a standard
in the industry or eﬀect change on other factories.
“That would merely result in me forking out money to support the
workers. I heard that some factories even secretly hire slaves to
minimize costs.”
Klein crossed his hands and said after a moment of silence, “Sir, the
root of your psychological illness comes from the buildup of guilt,
despite you believing that the guilt has faded and disappeared over
time. It wouldn’t have any visible eﬀects under normal
circumstances, but there was something that triggered you and set oﬀ
all the problems at once.”
“Something that triggered me? I’m not aware of such a thing,”
Deweyville said puzzled, but with conviction.
Klein allowed the chair to rock gently as he explained with a gentle
tone, “You did fall asleep for a few minutes just now, and you told
me something.”
“Hypnosis?” Deweyville made a guess as he usually did.
Klein did not give a direct reply and instead said, “You once saw a
girl dying on her way to work while you were on your carriage. She
had died because of lead poisoning. She was one of your workers
who glazed porcelain while she was still alive.”
Deweyville rubbed his temples, speechless before saying somewhat
doubtful, “I think that happened once… but I can’t remember it
clearly…”
His prolonged insomnia had left him in a poor mental state. He could
only faintly recall seeing such a scene.
He thought for a moment, but gave up taxing his brain. Instead, he
asked, “What was that worker’s name?
“Well, what I meant was, what should I do to cure my psychological
illness?”
Klein replied immediately, “Two things.”
“First, the worker that died by the side of the road was called Hayley
Walker. That was what you told me. She was the most direct trigger,
so you have to ﬁnd her parents and give them more compensation.
“Second, spread information about the dangers of lead in the
newspapers and magazines. Allow your charity foundation to help
more workers who suﬀered from the damage. If you succeed in
becoming a member of parliament, push for enacting laws in this
domain.”
Deweyville sat up slowly and laughed in a self-deprecating manner.
“I will do all of the rest, but to enact a law, heh— I think it’s
impossible since there is still competition from nations beyond our
country. Setting up such a law would just slip the entire industry in
the country into a crisis. Factories would become bankrupt one by
one, and many workers would lose their jobs. Organizations that help
the poor cannot save that many people.”
He slowly got oﬀ the bed and adjusted his collar. He then looked at
Klein and said, “Hayley Walker, right? I’ll immediately get Cullen to
retrieve information about her from the porcelain company and ﬁnd
her parents. Oﬃcer, please wait with me and continuously evaluate
my mental state.”
“Alright.” Klein stood up slowly and smoothed his black-and-white
checkered police uniform.
…
At eleven in the morning in the living room of Deweyville.
Klein sat on the sofa in silence as he looked at the man and woman
being guided into the house by Butler Cullen.
The two guests had blemished skin, wrinkles already woven into their
faces. The man had a slight hunch while the woman had a mole
under her eyelid.
They looked nearly identical to what Klein had seen through Hayley,
just older and more haggard. They were so skinny that they were
almost all bone. Their clothes were old and ragged. Klein even
learned that they couldn’t continue living on Lower Street of Iron
Cross Streets any further.
Sob…
Klein sensed an icy wind start to spiral through his spiritual
perception.
He pinched his glabella and shot a glance toward Sir Deweyville. It
was unknown when a faint white, translucent, contorted ﬁgure had
appeared behind him.
“Good-good morning, Honorable Sir.” Hayley’s parents were
unusually polite.
Deweyville rubbed his forehead and asked, “Are the both of you
Hayley Walker’s parents? Doesn’t she also have a brother and a two-
year-old sister?”
Hayley’s mother answered in fear, “Her-her brother broke his leg at
the harbor sometime back. We got him to take care of his sister at
home.”
Deweyville remained silent for a few seconds before he sighed.
“My deepest condolences for what happened to Hayley.”
Upon hearing that, the eyes of Hayley’s parents immediately turned
red. They opened their mouths and said over each other, “Thank-
thank you for your goodwill.
“The police told us-told us, that Hayley died from lead poisoning.
That’s the term, right? Oh, my poor child, she was only seventeen.
She was always so quiet, so determined.
“You had sent someone to visit her before and sponsored her burial.
She is buried at the Raphael Cemetery.”
Deweyville glanced at Klein and changed his sitting posture. He
leaned forward and said with a serious tone, “That was actually an
oversight of ours. I have to apologize.”
“I have considered that I need to compensate you, to compensate
Hayley. Her weekly salary was ten soli, was it not? One year would
be ﬁve hundred and twenty soli, or twenty-six pounds. Let’s assume
that she could have worked for another ten years.
“Cullen, give Hayley’s parents three hundred pounds.”
“Three-three hundred pounds?” Hayley’s parents were dumbfounded.
They never had more than one pound of savings, even at their
richest!
It wasn’t only them who were dazed. Even the expressions of the
bodyguards and maids in the room were also all that of shock and
envy. Even Sergeant Gate couldn’t help but draw in a deep breath—
his weekly salary was only two pounds and among his subordinates,
only one chevroned constable earned one pound a week.
Amidst the silence, Butler Cullen walked out of the study and held a
bulging sack.
He opened the sack and revealed stacks of cash, some one pound,
some ﬁve pounds, but mostly made up of one or ﬁve soli.
It was clear that Deweyville had made his subordinates receive
“change” from the bank earlier.
“It’s an expression of Sir Deweyville’s goodwill,” Cullen handed the
sack over to Hayley’s parents after receiving conﬁrmation from his
master.
Hayley’s parents took the sack and rubbed their eyes, looking at it in
disbelief.
“No, this-this is too generous, we cannot accept this,” they said as
they held the sack tightly.
Deweyville said in a deep voice, “This is what Hayley deserves.”
“Y-you truly are a noble, charitable knight!” Hayley’s parents bowed
repeatedly in agitation.
They had smiles on their faces, smiles that they couldn’t repress.
They praised the knight repeatedly, repeating the same few adjectives
they knew. They kept insisting that Hayley would be grateful towards
him in heaven.
“Cullen, send them home. Oh, take them to the bank ﬁrst,”
Deweyville heaved a sigh of relief and instructed his butler.
Hayley’s parents hugged the sack tightly and walked toward the door
quickly without stopping.
Klein saw the faint translucent ﬁgure behind Sir Deweyville attempt
to extend its hands towards them, hoping to leave with them, but the
parents’ smiles were abnormally radiant. They didn’t turn back.
That ﬁgure turned fainter and, soon, vanished completely.
Klein also sensed that the icy feeling in the guest hall had instantly
returned to normal.
From beginning to end, all he did was sit there silently, not
expressing his opinion.
“Oﬃcer, I feel much better. Now can you tell me why my butler,
servants, and bodyguards could also hear the cries and moans? This
shouldn’t just be solely a psychological illness of mine, right?”
Deweyville looked at him curiously.
Inspector Tolle, who knew the underlying truth, instantly became
nervous.
Klein replied without much expression, “In psychology, we call this
phenomenon—mass hysteria.”
Chapter 92: Psychological
Expert
“Mass hysteria?” Sir Deweyville, who had met many psychiatrists
recently, ruminated over the term Klein had said.
Despite their curiosity, his butler, bodyguards, and servants didn’t
make a single sound since they had not been given permission by
him.
As for Sergeant Gate, he looked towards Klein doubtfully as if he had
never heard of that concept.
Klein controlled his habit of tapping the armrest with his ﬁngertips
and calmly explained, “Humans can be fooled easily by their sensory
organs. Mass hysteria is a kind of psychogenic illness that is a result
of tense nerves and other factors amongst a group of individuals as
they inﬂuence each other.”
The jargon he spewed out confused Sir Deweyville, Sergeant Gate,
and the rest, causing them to subconsciously opt to believe him.
“Let me give a simple example of this; this was one of the cases that I
previously dealt with, one man held a dinner banquet and invited 35
guests. Midway, he suddenly felt disgusted and puked. After that, he
even had severe diarrhea. After a couple times, he began to believe
that he had gotten food poisoning. He shared his speculation with the
other guests on the way to the hospital.
“In the next two hours, there were more than 30 guests that had
diarrhea amongst the 35 guests, with 26 of them experiencing
nausea. They ﬂooded the entire emergency room of the hospital.
“The doctors went through a detailed examination and performed
cross checks, and they concluded that the very ﬁrst man didn’t have
food poisoning at all. Instead, it was a result of stomach inﬂammation
caused by the change of weather and cold liquor.
“The most surprising fact was that none of the guests who went to
the hospital had food poisoning. In fact, not a single one of them was
sick.
“That is mass hysteria.”
Deweyville nodded slightly and marveled, “I understand now.
Humans do lie to themselves easily. It’s no wonder that Emperor
Roselle once said that a lie would become reality once it was
repeated a hundred times.
“Oﬃcer, how may I address you? You are the most professional
psychiatrist I have ever met.”
“Inspector Moretti.” Klein pointed at his epaulet and said, “Sir, your
troubles have been resolved temporarily for now. You can try to sleep
now while I determine if there are any other problems. If you are
able to sleep well, please allow us to bid farewell ahead of time
instead of waiting for you to wake up.”
“Alright.” Deweyville massaged his forehead, took his cane, and
walked upstairs to his bedroom.
Half an hour later, a police carriage left the fountain at the door of
Deweyville’s residence.
When Sergeant Gate got oﬀ on the way and returned to his police
station, Inspector Tolle looked towards Klein. He complimented in
jest, “Even I believed that you were a real psychological expert…”
Before he ﬁnished his sentence, he saw the young man in a black-
and-white checkered uniform looking expressionless. His eyes were
deep and serene as he forced a smirk on his face and said, “I only had
some experience with it in the past.”
Inspector Tolle fell silent until the carriage arrived outside 36
Zouteland Street.
“Thank you for your assistance, allowing Sir Deweyville to be ﬁnally
free from his problems and be able to ﬁnd sleep again.” He extended
his hand and shook Klein’s hand. “Thank Dunn on my behalf.”
Klein nodded slightly and said, “Alright.”
He went up the stairs and returned to the Blackthorn Security
Company. He knocked and entered the captain’s oﬃce.
“Done?” Dunn was waiting for his lunch.
“Done.” Klein massaged his forehead, and kept his reply short and
simple. “The root of the problem stemmed from the lead and
porcelain factory under Sir Deweyville. From the moment they were
established to this day, too many deaths have been caused by lead
poisoning. And every accident left Sir Deweyville with some resentful
spirituality.”
“Generally speaking, that wouldn’t bring too big of a problem. That
might cause nightmares, at the most.” Dunn had experienced similar
cases with his plethora of experience.
Klein nodded slightly and said, “Yes, that’s usually the case. But,
unfortunately, Sir Deweyville encountered a female worker who died
of lead poisoning on the streets. She collapsed by the side of the
street and happened to catch a glimpse of the Deweyville’s family
emblem. She also harbored intense indignation, worry, and desires. It
was only when Sir Deweyville gave her parents, brother, and sister a
compensation of three hundred pounds did her emotions dissipate.”
“This is a societal problem. It isn’t rare in the Age of Steam and
Machinery.” Dunn took out his smoking pipe, smelled the tobacco,
and sighed. “Workers that make linen work in damp environments,
and are generally diagnosed with bronchitis and joint related
ailments. As for factories with serious powder and dust issues, even if
the dust isn’t poisonous, it can still accumulate into lung problems…
Sigh… We don’t have to talk about this. As the kingdom develops, I
believe these problems will be resolved. Klein, let’s ﬁnd a restaurant
tonight to celebrate you becoming an oﬃcial member, alright?”
Klein thought for a moment before saying, “How about tomorrow…
Captain, I have used Spirit Vision for an extended period of time
today and also used dream divination to directly interact with those
resentments. I’m feeling especially drained. I want to return home in
the afternoon to get some rest. Would that be okay? Oh, then I’ll
head over to the Divination Club at about four or ﬁve in the
afternoon to see how the club members are reacting to news of
Hanass Vincent’s sudden death.”
“No problem, that’s only necessary.” Dunn chuckled. “Tomorrow
night it is. Let’s do it at Old Will’s Restaurant next door. I’ll get
Rozanne to make a reservation.”
Klein took oﬀ his police peak cap and stood up to salute him.
“Thank you, Captain. See you tomorrow.”
Dunn lifted his hand and said, “Hold on, did you mention that Sir
Deweyville gave the female worker’s parents a compensation of three
hundred pounds?”
“Yes.” Klein nodded and immediately understood the reason why the
captain had mentioned it. “You are worried that they will get into
trouble because of their wealth?”
Dunn sighed.
“I’ve seen many similar situations in the past. Pass me their address,
I’ll ask Kenley to arrange for them to leave Tingen for another city, to
start life anew.”
“Alright,” Klein replied in a deep voice.
With all of that done, he left Dunn’s oﬃce and entered the break
room diagonally opposite. He changed into his original suit and left
the police uniform in his locker.
Klein took the public carriage back to Daﬀodil Street in silence. He
took oﬀ his coat and top hat. He then heated up the leftovers from
last night and ate them with the last piece of wheat bread to ﬁll his
stomach.
Then, he went to the second ﬂoor, hung his clothes, and slumped into
bed.
When he woke up, the pocket watch showed that it was already ten
past two in the afternoon. The sun was hanging high up in the sky
and the sunlight shone through the clouds.
Underneath the golden splendor, Klein stood next to his desk and
looked out the oriel window. He watched the pedestrians in old
ragged clothing as they entered or left Iron Cross Street.
Phew… He let out a breath slowly, ﬁnally overcoming his low spirits.
Every journey had to be taken one step at a time. Likewise, his
Sequence needed to be advanced one level at a time. Everything
worked like that.
He shook his head and sat down. He started concluding and
reorganizing his encounter over the last week, so as to reinforce the
important points in his mind to prevent himself from forgetting them.
Five minutes before three in the afternoon.
Above a blurry, boundless, grayish-white, silent gray fog stood a lofty
palace. An ancient mottled bronze table sat there quietly.
On the seat of honor at the long table sat a man already engulfed by
the thick gray fog.
Klein leaned against the back of the chair and contemplated. He
suddenly extended his hand and tapped on the crimson stars that
represented Justice and The Hanged Man.
…
Backlund, Empress Borough.
Audrey lifted her dress as she quickly walked towards her bedroom.
Suddenly, she felt something and looked sideways at the shadow
sitting on the balcony. As expected, she saw her golden retriever,
Susie, who was sitting there in silence, observing her as always.
Audrey sighed and drew a crimson moon on her chest. She then got
closer and looked down at her golden retriever from a commanding
position.
“Susie, that’s not right. This is peeping. A Spectator has to observe in
an open manner.”
The golden retriever lifted its head to look at its owner and shook its
tail.
After nagging her dog, Audrey didn’t delay any further and continued
walking towards her bedroom again.
In the few seconds of opening and closing the door, she suddenly had
a weird idea.
“I wonder if Mr. Fool would allow Susie to enter that mysterious
space. Then, there would be four members in the Tarot Gathering!
And all of them would be Beyonders!
“No way, Susie can’t talk. If they were to let her express her opinion
and share her thoughts, what would she do? Woof woof woof? Howl
howl? Eww, why am I mimicking a dog’s bark here…
“Just imagining such a scene feels really strange. A mysterious and
solemn gathering with the sudden barking of a dog… Mr. Fool would
deﬁnitely kick us out of the Tarot Gathering directly…”
Audrey locked the door and sat by the side of her bed. She took out a
piece of old yellowish-brown paper from underneath her pillow.
She read it repeatedly and entered her Spectator state.
…
In a particular area of the Sonia Sea, an old sailboat which was in
pursuit of the Listener had already left the Rorsted Archipelago.
Seafarer Alger Wilson was worried that the wall clock’s machinery
would malfunction, so he entered the captain’s cabin about half an
hour earlier in case he had misjudged the time which would cause his
subordinates to see him getting pulled into the Tarot Gathering.
In front of him was a glass of nearly transparent liquor. The rich
aroma swirled strand after strand into his nostrils.
Alger trembled once again when he thought of the impending
Gathering, the boundless fog that presented itself in front of him in
the hotel’s corridor, and the mysterious Fool who sat in the middle of
the gray fog.
He lifted his glass and took a gulp, using the burning sensation in his
throat to ease the emotions that had stirred within him.
Very soon, he restored his calm. He was as calm and stoic as he
always was.
Chapter 93: New Diary Page
Above the gray fog, gigantic stone columns held up a majestic divine
hall.
Two dark red blobs extended out into faint human ﬁgures by the side
of the ancient mottled bronze table.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Fool.” Augmented with a blurry eﬀect, Audrey
greeted him with a bow and smiled. “It is unfortunate that there is no
wine here; otherwise, we could have a toast to your successful trial.”
She was referring to the ritualistic magic.
“You are more powerful than we imagined,” Alger Wilson praised as
well.
Klein was surrounded by the thick fog as usual. He pressed down
with his right arm and spoke with his normal tone, replying as
though it was natural.
“Great, this means that we are on the path of excellence. If you have
any matters to tend to that leave you unable to attend the gathering
on Mondays, conduct the ritual and inform me. All you have to do is
change the line in the incantation ‘I pray for a good dream’ with the
reason.”
“Alright,” Audrey quickly agreed. “Mr. Fool, I obtained another page
of Emperor Roselle’s diary. I believe I still owe you one page.”
“I was away from land this week and haven’t found any new pages.”
Alger placed his right hand near his chest and bowed in apology.
“No matter. I expected my request to take a long time.” Klein leaned
back into his chair and tapped the armrest with his index ﬁnger. He
looked at Miss Justice and said, “You can express the contents of the
diary now.”
Audrey bowed slightly and said, “As you wish.”
A pen suddenly appeared before her. She recalled the symbols that
she had memorized and tried her best to transcribe them.
In seconds, she saw that the goatskin was already ﬁlled with content.
The strange symbols neatly covered the entire page.
After checking the contents, she put down the fountain pen and said,
“It’s done.”
Klein raised his hand and the goatskin parchment appeared in his
palm.
Shifting his gaze down, he started reading without emotion.
“July 9th. I suddenly thought of an interesting question. Since the
Sequence pathways are also called the ‘Blessings of The Divinities’ or
‘Pathways of The Divinities’, then why would the stone slate that
records the completed twenty-two Sequence pathways be called the
‘Blasphemy Slate’. Blasphemy, what an interesting term… Just who is
the one blasphemed?
“And who created the Blasphemy Slate? How could that person hold
all of the Sequence pathways? Just what other information was on
the stone? I really want to see it…
“July 12th. I’ve realized another fact today. The Sealed Artifacts are
an important component of a church’s overall strength, even though
some of the sealed items are very, very dangerous. Among the seven
churches, the God of Craftsmanship wields the least number of Sealed
Artifacts which are also relatively less dangerous… Did I join an
organization without a future? No, I should think of it this way; only
a blank piece of paper can produce a good painting. A weak
organization is the best place for me to display my abilities!
“July 14th. I saw that mysterious Mr. Zaratul again. I never expected
him to be the leader of an ancient organization, the Secret Order!”
Klein’s pupils constricted when he read this. He nearly revealed an
unnatural expression.
The Zaratul family only had a certain connection with the Secret
Order in the notes of the Church of the Evernight Goddess. But now,
he learned from Emperor Roselle that the mysterious Mr. Zaratul was
further determined to be the leader of the Secret Order.
From the looks of it, it is an unquestionable fact that the Secret Order
holds the Seer Sequence pathway…
While Klein was reading the diary, Audrey looked over and began
observing him out of habit.
However, her ﬁeld of vision was completely obscured by the thick
fog.
Momentarily taken aback, Audrey snapped back to her senses and
turned her head frantically to look at the other illusory dark red star.
I was too reckless, too insolent, too foolish in trying to observe Mr. Fool…
I was lucky, lucky that he isn’t angry. Audrey stuck out her tongue
secretly and pretended to admire the scenery. She was just short of
humming a lively tune.
Alger sat silently, his gaze never leaving the long bronze table. He
knew his place, as if he was in the presence of a true god.
Klein collected himself and scanned the last portion of the diary.
“After learning that I had become a Savant, Mr. Zaratul mentioned
that I had chosen a diﬃcult, yet relatively safe path. I asked him why
that was the case, but all he did was smile before telling me that the
Sequence pathway contains secrets beyond my imagination. I
couldn’t help but ask him which Sequence pathway he selected. He
told me that his Sequence 9 was Seer.
“I intentionally mocked him and asked if every Seer only disclosed
half-truths, never explaining things more clearly. Furthermore, he
was clearly a powerful High-Sequence Beyonder. There was no need
for him to continue acting as a Seer!
“Mr. Zaratul told me that it was a habit he adopted from back when
he was a Seer, and that this was a method that could pique my
curiosity and make me cooperate with him. He hoped that I could
help him steal a dangerous sealed item from the Church of the God of
Craftsmanship, a relic of the Antigonus family.
“Clearly, this must wait until I become a core member of the Church
of the God of Craftsmanship. I asked Mr. Zaratul how long it would
take to digest the potion if I used the acting method, and what
standards I should use to determine if I had digested it completely.
“He told me that for the lower Sequences, it would only take half a
year to digest the potion as long as one strictly used the acting
method. In fact, in the fastest case, it might only take a month. And
standard measure for progress was simple; every Beyonder would
sense it immediately once the potion was completely digested. It is
what it is.
“I asked him for more details, but he merely smiled at me.
“To hell with his smiles, I’ll beat up every Seer I see when I become a
High-Sequence Beyonder!”
…Rest in peace, Emperor… Klein read the diary several times before
looking at Justice and The Hanged Man again.
“Sorry for the wait.”
“It is our honor.” Audrey was still shocked, forgetting that she was a
Spectator.
She looked at The Hanged Man and organized her words.
“Where can I ﬁnd the Psychology Alchemists?”
Psychology Alchemists… Klein suddenly recalled the man buying
supplementary ingredients for the Spectator potion at the Tingen
underground market.
Perhaps he was a member of the Psychology Alchemists?
Just as Klein was considering how to get closer to that man, The
Hanged Man, Alger Wilson shook his head and said, “Miss Justice,
ﬁrstly, I don’t have a clue. Secondly, I don’t think there’s any rush in
seeking out the Psychology Alchemists. What you should focus on
now is completely digesting the Spectator potion.”
Audrey glanced at The Fool and noticed that he didn’t have any
intention of adding to the conversation. She nodded in
disappointment and said, “All I want is to have plenty of time to
prepare so that I can approach them more naturally. Alright, then
when can I digest the Spectator potion and stop acting? Is there a
standard that indicates when I can? I’m almost at the point where I
no longer feel frustrated, nor do I hear the constant murmuring
anymore.”
Alger looked at The Fool in the fog but saw that he didn’t have any
intention of speaking. He then deliberated before saying, “If you
don’t use the acting method, the typical rule of thumb is to wait three
years and conﬁrm that you no longer feel restless or receive any
auditory or visual illusions. There is one simple test to determine
when you can. That method is to exhaust your body to its limit. If
you still don’t hear any maniacal murmurings or see any strange
things at that point, that would mean that you’re ready to advance.”
“With regards to the acting method, I have also just come into
contact with it. It feels good, so I don’t think it’ll take three years.”
That wasn’t useful at all… Three years, that’s too long… Audrey
criticized inwardly.
She had just thought about this when she heard an armrest being
tapped.
Audrey froze, then turned her head in joy. She saw The Fool tapping
on the edge of the long table.
Alger sat straighter, waiting for The Fool to speak.
Klein said in his normal tone, “For Low-Sequence Beyonders, as long
as you strictly stick to acting, you should be able to digest the
medicine in half a year. It’s even possible to do it in a month.”
He looked at Justice and added, “As for the signs of digestion, you’ll
know it when it comes. It doesn’t need to be taught.”
“One month… Great! Thank you, Mr. Fool!” Audrey exclaimed while
brimming with joy.
Miss Justice, don’t think that you are the chosen one. The key point is half
a year…Klein lifted his right hand and placed it beside his lips.
“Half a year…” Alger repeated softly.
Audrey sensed joy, relief, and intense doubt in his tone.
What is he suspicious about? Audrey thought as she asked, “Mr. Fool,
have you considered adding more members?”
Klein leaned back casually. He had long prepared an answer.
“This started as a trial, so I didn’t spend much time thinking about
extending our meetings.
“But now, as a regular gathering, we must choose our members
carefully. Secrecy is our motto.”
Audrey nodded gently and said, “That is to say that we have to
follow a process of observation, recommendation, and testing
process. Yes, a process.”
“You can interpret it that way,” Klein aﬃrmed.
In his mind he was thinking about how he could inquire about the
Secret Order and the Clown potion.
How can I ask questions in a way that beﬁts my status? Klein was placed
in a diﬃcult spot.
At that moment, realizing that Justice temporarily had nothing else
to say, Alger took the initiative to speak, “I’ve heard that a Listener
from the Aurora Order is searching for traces of the True Creator,
which is the holy residence they advocate.”
“True Creator?” Audrey asked, puzzled.
“It is an ancient entity worshiped by numerous secret organizations
and cults. They believe that the Creator hasn’t completely perished.
The Core he left behind is the True Creator.” Alger gave a rough
explanation. “Since the Fifth Epoch, the True Creator has appeared in
many forms, such as The Hanged Giant or the Eye behind the Shadow
Curtains. Heh heh, many people believe that Emperor Roselle
referenced the imagery of the True Creator when he was creating the
tarot cards; hence, there exists the card of The Hanged Man.”
At this point, he looked at Klein and said, “Mr. Fool, there’s nothing
with what I said, right?”
Is he trying to probe for my views on the True Creator? Klein thought
about the bloody man on the cross that the Captain saw in Hanass
Vincent’s dream and immediately had an idea.
Doesn’t both the hanging and the shadows imply evil connotations?
Therefore, he chuckled and said, “I am more inclined to call him, the
Fallen Creator.”
Chapter 94: Hidden Sage
“The Fallen Creator… Fallen…” Alger ruminated over The Fool’s
words and fell deep in thought.
However, what struck Alger the most was The Fool’s relaxed, natural,
and nonchalant attitude.
He acted as if they were equal!
If he hadn’t experienced their previous ritual, Alger might have
thought The Fool was merely bluﬃng, and building himself up to
intimidate him and Justice. But now, he was of the opinion that even
if The Fool was inferior to the True Creator, he was at least close to
that level.
It’s dangerous. It’s also an opportunity… Alger muttered softly. He then
spoke with a smile, “Mr. Fool, your description is indeed more
appropriate. According to our observations, Beyonders who believed
in the True Creator, no—the Fallen Creator, have a higher probability
of losing control. The rest of them are mostly psychopaths.”
That’s something that the Nighthawks’ intelligence mentioned as well…
And the so-called ‘psychopaths’ didn’t lose their sanity; instead, their
ideologies become twisted… Klein maintained his seated posture but
didn’t continue with the conversation.
He was still considering how to inquire about the Secret Order and
Clown potion, but he couldn’t ﬁgure out a way of asking the
questions in a way that ﬁt with his persona.
It’s such a pity that the Gathering is still so diﬀerent from an Internet
forum. Otherwise, I could create another smurf account to join the
Gathering, and that account would be in charge of asking questions that
are inconvenient for me to ask… Perhaps, one day, I’ll learn mirror-
related magic and give it a try. For example, I can make half the members
here my smurf accounts…
There are twenty-two chairs here, and there are twenty-two cards in the
tarot deck. That matches up perfectly. But when I ‘created’ this divine
hall, I didn’t even name myself ‘The Fool’ or have any intention of
forming a ‘Tarot Club’. Hmm, do these symbolize the twenty-two diﬀerent
Sequence pathways?
I wanted a divine hall, so a divine hall appeared. If I wanted a smurf
account, would I get a smurf account…
Upon seeing The Fool remain silently engulfed in the thick gray fog,
Audrey asked both wistfully and curiously, “That sounds scary. Mr.
Hanged Man, could you share, in detail, information about each, and
every mysterious organization? And also the matters regarding each
secret cult? It’s hard for me to come into contact with them during
my daily life. I can only understand them through the both of you.
I’m willing to pay for it. May I know what you’d like in return?”
That’s a great question! Miss Justice, you’re playing the role of my smurf
account to a certain extent… This way, The Hanged Man will deﬁnitely
bring up the Secret Order… You’re the best! Klein’s mind stirred when
he heard that, but he didn’t let his emotions show through his
expression or movements.
Alger thought for a moment before saying, “I need money—a
thousand pounds. It’d be best if they weren’t bills marked by a serial
number. Or maybe gemstones that have just been unearthed. Price
them according to the Backlund Jewelry Exchange’s monthly average
price.”
A thousand pounds? That’s a huge sum of money. It could be used to buy
a house in a high-class street in Tingen City! Not everyone would have
that available immediately… Captain might have an annual salary like
that, I guess? Hayley’s death compensation was only three hundred
pounds… Although Miss Justice is a noble, she obviously hasn’t inherited
her family’s wealth yet, and she’ll only be receiving some sort of annual
allowance… Hmm, it’s no wonder that The Hanged Man stated that it
could be paid via gemstones… Klein was very sensitive towards
monetary ﬁgures. Luckily, he was blanketed in thick fog.
For a single lady or madam, two thousand pounds could let her live a
decent life!
If two thousand pounds were invested, the investment could reliably
produce an annual return of about a hundred pounds.
“A thousand pounds?” Audrey said, sounding shocked. She then
replied happily, “No problem, do I send it to the previous address?”
Judging by Miss Justice’s tone, she ﬁnds it very cheap? Klein didn’t look
over.
Alger was quiet for a good twenty seconds before he said, “Yes, send
it to the Warrior & Sea Bar at Pelican Street, in the White Rose
Borough of Pritz Harbor. Tell the boss, Williams, that it’s what the
‘Captain’ wants.
“Alright.” Audrey leaned back and posed in a Spectator-like manner.
“Mr. Hanged Man, you can start now.”
Alger looked at The Fool, deliberated for a moment before saying
slowly, “Let’s start from the Moses Ascetic Order. It is the earliest
hidden organization. Of course, many think that the earliest hidden
organizations are the Church of the Evernight Goddess, the Church of
Mother Earth, and the Church of the God of Combat.
“These people must be from the Church of Lord of Storms, the
Church of Eternal Blazing Sun, or the Church of the God of
Knowledge and Wisdom,” Audrey refuted sulkily.
The Church of the Goddess is the earliest hidden organization? That was
the ﬁrst time Klein had heard of such a claim.
What exactly happened in the Fourth Epoch or the Third Epoch?
Alger smiled and said, “The truth is buried in ancient history. Only
one thing is certain: no one has ever said that the Church of Lord of
Storms, the Church of Eternal Blazing Sun, or the Church of the God
of Knowledge and Wisdom were once hidden organizations.
“Alright, let’s save some time and return to main topic. The Moses
Ascetic Order was ﬁrst established by a few humans that had read the
Blasphemy Slate. They believed in an non-anthropomorphic god,
called ‘the Hidden Sage’.”
“The description is that of a god, but it is more of an ideology, a
natural law. For example, all objects are numeric. The Hidden Sage is
an embodiment of Spirit Numerology. Or that knowledge is supreme,
and the Hidden Sage is knowledge itself. Hence, the original Moses
Ascetic Order was a very respectable organization, and it maintained
a good relationship with the other major churches.
“The members of the organization led ascetic lives to resist losing
control and to resolve the eﬀects of the Remnant potion. They strictly
kept their order’s secrets, and they upheld moral and religious
precepts. They believe that humans continuously reincarnate after
death…
“The Sequence 9 that they grasp is called Mystery Pryer… The word
‘Warlock’ was also spread from that organization.”
Audrey listened to The Hanged Man’s description carefully and asked
sharply, “You said that the Moses Ascetic Order used to be a
respectable organization. Are they not one anymore?”
Alger nodded his head indiscernibly.
“Yes, they have fallen into corruption and are now an evil
organization.”
“Why? I ﬁnd their beliefs very good and very normal,” Audrey
expressed her confusion.
That was Klein’s confusion too. The information that he could get at
his security clearance didn’t provide the reason for the Moses Ascetic
Order’s fall from grace.
Alger looked at the unfathomable Fool and tersely agreed.
“I am not sure of the real reason. It might be because it has been
buried by history. However, I have heard one terrifying explanation.
“In that story, the main reason why the Moses Ascetic Order fell into
corruption was because the god that they believed in, the Hidden
Sage, had come to life!
“He became the personiﬁcation of an evil god!”
“Came to life? This… how?” Audrey found it unimaginable as she
replied with an incredulous tone.
Without realizing it, she had exited from her Spectator state.
It’s like a horror story, but the ghost is even a god… Klein’s heart stirred
with a surge of emotions as well.
“I’m sorry, no one knows the answer.” Alger had originally wanted to
casually say, “Maybe Mr. Fool would know,” but he held back the
urge.
He had already teetered on the borders of danger once.
In the The Book of Storms 5:7, there was a saying that Alger
remembered clearly, which was: “Do not test God!”
Audrey calmed herself down and didn’t press for more answers. She
gestured for him to continue.
Klein maintained his seated posture and his silence, validating The
Hanged Man’s descriptions with his own understanding.
Finally, he realized that there were four points that he needed to take
note of.
First, the Demoness Sect was also known as the Demoness Family in
the Fourth Epoch. Back then, they had very few members, and their
beliefs were passed down through their bloodlines. Plus, they would
kill the fathers of their children and abandon the baby boys. Hence,
all the members were female. Of course, that was all from Alger’s
description, and there was no way to verify it at the moment.
Second, the Numinous Episcopate that believed in Death and the
Rose School of Thought that liked bloody sacriﬁcial worship
ceremonies both originated in the Southern Continent. After the
colonial era came, they almost vanished under attacks by the seven
churches. But as such, they began spreading to the Northern
Continent.
Third, the current Psychology Alchemists was similar to the earlier
Moses Ascetic Order. They believed in an non-anthropomorphic
existence and believed that the human spirit could change
everything.
Fourth, the Secret Order had the lowest activity level among all the
other hidden organizations. Thus, they were the most unknown.
Every time they appeared, they seem to be after something or looking
for something.
What are they after or looking for? Klein suddenly recalled the diary
which he had read earlier: The leader of the Secret Order, Zaratul,
cooperated with the Roselle. His goal was to get something left
behind by the Antigonus Family.
Their appearance that time was to look for the lost notebook, the
Antigonus family notebook… Klein narrowed his eyes slightly and
felt that he had apparently found the key reason for the Secret
Order’s actions.
They are after the things that the Antigonus family left behind!
Klein suppressed his urge to tap the edge of the table as his thoughts
appeared one after another.
Oh, they were looking for remnant traces the Antigonus family left
behind?
Then must I direct my focus onto these areas to obtain the Clown potion
formula from the Secret Order?
After a further exchange of information, Klein announced the end of
the Gathering.
“By your will.” Audrey and Alger stood up together.
Cutting oﬀ the connections, he saw both their ﬁgures shatter and
disappear. Klein rubbed his glabella and attempted conjuring a smurf
account with his mind.
As he thought, a ﬁgure appeared at the furthest end of the long
bronze table. That ﬁgure was wearing a black tuxedo, a silk top hat,
and a dull expression. His actions were clumsy and inarticulate. Even
though he was engulfed in gray fog, it was obvious that something
was wrong with him.
That won’t do… Klein experimented a few more times before sighing
and dismissing the idea of creating a smurf account.
He attempted other things too. He continued to sit above the gray fog
in the seat of honor at the long bronze table. He considered what
Audrey had said, and he cast his gaze curiously at the illusory
crimson stars.
After a moment of silence, Klein started to pray as a form of feedback
instead of establishing contact with those stars.
Amidst the tranquility and silence, he didn’t receive any feedback
from the ten plus crimson stars nearby.
In order to receive feedback, I need to pull someone above the gray fog
before I can reply? Klein nodded as he thought, feeling somewhat
disappointed.
He didn’t want to violate someone else’s will and forcefully pull them
into this mysterious space.
Hmm… Klein was just getting ready to leave, but he habitually
touched a nearby illusory crimson star.
Just then, he suddenly felt that there was a faint and insigniﬁcant
prayer deep inside the crimson star!
Chapter 95: The Supplicant
“A prayer?”
Klein’s mind stirred as he used the same method he used back when
he spied on The Hanged Man. He allowed his spirituality to spread
outward and touch the crimson blob.
A hazy and contorted image appeared within his sight. He could
faintly see a blond teen kneeling on the ground, facing a pure crystal
ball.
That teenager was dressed in a tight-ﬁtting black outﬁt, with a style
very diﬀerent from the contemporary styles of the Loen Kingdom. It
was more congruent with the traditional clothing of the Feysac
Empire and the Intis Republic that Klein had seen from reading
magazines.
The area surrounding the teenager was dark and had old furniture.
From time to time, the room would be illuminated, but Klein couldn’t
hear the roaring thunder or the pattering of rain.
In the image, the teenager had his hands on his forehead, ﬁngers
crossed. He bowed forward, continually praying for something. His
thick accent buzzed in Klein’s ears.
Klein listened attentively but discovered an awkward fact.
He couldn’t understand what the other party was saying. It was a
language that he had never come across in his life!
…To think that I cannot understand a foreign language even though I am
the mysterious ruler of this world above the gray fog… Klein gave a self-
deprecating laugh. He indignantly tried listening in once again in a
manner more attentive than when he had to do English listening
comprehension tests back on Earth.
As he was listening to the prayers, he gradually discovered
something.
Even though he had never learned the language the young man was
speaking, he found that it had similarities to Ancient Feysac!
Father… Mother… Those are likely the meanings of those two terms,
right? It is quite similar to Ancient Feysac, but not without its
diﬀerences… Klein creased his brows and slipped into deep thought.
Ancient Feysac was a common language in the Fourth Epoch. It is also the
root language of all the contemporary languages of this era. Furthermore,
it is still evolving… I cannot conﬁrm it right now…
He listened to it over and over again, eliminating the possibility of
the language being a modern language like Loen, Feysac, or Intis.
Could it be a dialect of Ancient Feysac? Like the language used in the
Antigonus family’s diary? Klein tapped his ﬁnger on the edge of the
bronze table and nodded indiscernibly. There was another possibility.
Ancient Feysac didn’t spring into existence out of nothing, it was an
evolution of Jotun, the language of the Giants… The Feysac Empire in the
north has always claimed that its people possesses the bloodline of the
Giants. Perhaps, this is ancient Jotun.
At this point, Klein, who lacked knowledge, could only stop. He
retracted his spirituality, without looking or listening in to that scene.
He had no intention of pulling the praying teen up above the fog
immediately. He wanted to know what the young man was talking
about ﬁrst.
Of course, before that, he had to observe him frequently and conduct
basic ‘tests’.
Phew. Klein exhaled as he leaned back in his chair.
He enveloped himself with his spirituality and simulated the feeling
of falling.
…
After “revising” Roselle’s diary, Klein changed into his formal wear
and left for the Divination Club.
He took the public transport despite his pay rise, but he did splurge
to support Mrs. Wendy’s business. He spent 1.5 pence on sweet iced
tea to combat the afternoon heat.
When he arrived at Howes Street, Klein tossed the empty cup into the
trash can and walked up to the second ﬂoor.
Before entering the building, he pinched his glabella and activated
his Spirit Vision.
Klein had just entered the hall when he felt a faint, lingering grief.
The pretty receptionist Angelica was sitting there; her slightly red
eyes looked unfocused.
“The grief will pass in time,” Klein said with a gentle and ﬁrm tone as
he walked toward Angelica.
Angelica looked up abruptly and muttered, clearly confused, “Mr.
Moretti…”
She quickly came to her senses and asked, perturbed, “Y-you already
know about Mr. Vincent?
“Oh right, I forgot that you’re an exceptional fortune-teller.”
Klein sighed appropriately.
“I only managed to divine a very rough outline of what transpired…
Just what exactly happened to Mr. Vincent?”
“The boss told us that Mr. Vincent had a heart attack in his sleep and
left this world peacefully.” Angelica cried as she said, “He was so
friendly, so polite, a true gentleman. He was the spiritual mentor of
so many of our members. H-he was still so young…”
“I am sorry for bringing up this sad topic.” Klein didn’t console her
any further. He walked toward the meeting room slowly.
Angelica took out a handkerchief and wiped her eyes and nose. She
then looked at Klein’s back and asked loudly, “Mr. Moretti, what
would you like to drink?”
“Black tea.” Klein preferred black tea to coﬀee, even though he found
the black tea average.
In comparison, he preferred ginger beer and sweet iced tea. But as a
gentleman, it was not right for him to act like a child in a formal
setting…
As it was a Monday, there were only ﬁve or six members in the
meeting room. Using his Spirit Vision, Klein saw that they each had
diﬀerent colors of emotion. Some were grieving, some more dull,
some relatively unaﬀected.
They’re all rather normal… normal reactions. Klein nodded slightly. He
picked up his cane and found a spot in the room.
He was about to deactivate his Spirit Vision when he saw Angelica
walk in and walk towards him.
“Mr. Moretti, a customer is looking for you. Well, it’s the person from
last time,” the beautiful lady said with a hushed tone.
“You still remember him?” Klein asked with a smile.
Hmm, I wonder if he bought the magical medicine as I instructed… I
wonder if he still needs surgery…
Angelica covered her mouth and said, “He was the only person who
was willing to wait an entire afternoon in the club for a divination.”
Klein grabbed his cane and stood up. He walked outside without
saying anything.
In the reception area, he found the person who had sought his
services the other day. He also noticed that the aura near his liver
had regained its normal color. His overall health had also improved.
“Congratulations, the feeling of being healthy is wonderful indeed.”
Klein smiled as he extended a hand.
Bogda was ﬁrst taken aback before he immediately extended both
hands. He grabbed Klein’s right palm tightly.
“Mr. Moretti, you truly can ‘see’ my condition!
“Yes, I have fully recovered! The doctors asked me questions over
and over again, ran repeated tests on me, but they cannot believe
that I recovered just like that!”
Upon hearing Bogda’s ecstatic description, Klein calmly conﬁrmed
one thing—the apothecary at Lawson’s Folk Herb Store was deﬁnitely
a Beyonder!
He had seen how severe the man’s liver disease had been. Fully
healing him in the span of a few days was beyond the capability of
herbs and medical ability. The only possible explanation was that of a
Beyonder!
Coupled with the incident with Glacis, there could only be one
answer.
“I have to repent to God. To think that I would suspect you, suspect
that miraculous doctor.” Bogda refused to let go of Klein’s hand. He
continued on about his shame and gratitude, “…those ten pounds
were truly money well spent. It bought my life back!”
What? Ten pounds? You spent ten pounds on the miraculous medicine?
And you only gave me eight pence for my divination… Just eight pence…
eight pence… pence…Klein was dazed just hearing about it.
At this moment, Bogda released his hands as he took a step back
while beaming. He bowed reverently and said, “I am here today to
express my gratitude. Thank you, Master Moretti. You showed me the
way and saved my life.
“This was the outcome of you paying to have something divined. You
need not thank anybody.” Klein lifted his head slightly and looked at
the divide between the wall and the ceiling. His answer fully
expressed the vibes of a charlatan.
“You are a true seer,” Bogda praised. “Next, I’ll be heading to Vlad
Street to thank that apothecary and buy the medicine he
recommended.”
“Haven’t you already recovered?” Klein expertly hid the shock in his
voice.
Bogda looked around, and laughed when he conﬁrmed that the
receptionist was not paying attention to them. He chuckled softly and
said, “The doctor mentioned a concoction of herbs that includes
mummy powder. It is a prescription that would satisfy both men and
women… I didn’t believe the doctor back then, but I have no more
doubts now.”
…There’s a prescription like that? Klein suddenly felt that the
apothecary was a cheat, and suspected if he had pushed the person in
front of him into a ﬁery pit of doom.
He observed Bogda and conﬁrmed that there was no problem with
his aura.
“Mummy powder?” Klein cautiously asked.
“Yes, mummy powder. I have asked a friend, he said that even the
nobles of Backlund are maniacally looking for such an item. It’s a
powder made by grinding mummies which gives men peak
performance in bed. Even though it’s disgusting and sounds dirty, it
truly is a material used by the aristocrats…” Bogda gave a detailed
description. He had an eager desire in his eyes.
Mummies? Mummies made from corpses? Then grinding them to powder?
Klein was dumbfounded. He nearly retched in front of Bogda.
Those nobles sure are hardcore… Just as he was about to advise Bogda
against doing so, Glacis, who had suﬀered from a lung disease
previously, stepped into the door and heard Bogda’s description.
“Yes, it’s very eﬀective. I would recommend that you head to
Lawson’s Folk Herb Store at Vlad Street. Mr. Lawson’s secret recipe is
very eﬀective!” Glacis took oﬀ his spectacles and leaned over with
interest. He recommended with a hushed tone, “My experience was
very, very, very perfect.”
“You know of it too? I was just about to head to Mr. Lawson’s Folk
Herb Store.” Bogda’s worries vanished completely.
After a short conversation, he left the Divination Club in a hurry.
Up until then, Klein was still a little dumbfounded.
He waited till twenty past ﬁve in the afternoon before putting on his
hat and picking up his black cane. He took a carriage down to Vlad
Street, intending to observe the apothecary named Lawson Darkweed
before deciding if he should notify the captain or not.
…
18 Vlad Street.
Klein stood outside the herb store and saw the closed door, as well as
a subletting notice.
…Quite a wary man… he muttered silently.
Since this had happened, he no longer had to be troubled or perform
any observations.
Chapter 96: Daly's Guess
By the afternoon of the next day, Klein had fully recovered from any
signs of exhaustion. He walked into the Blackthorn Security Company
with steady footsteps.
“Good morning, Klein. The weather is so cool and beautiful today,
I’m looking forward to tonight’s feast.” Rozanne who was wearing a
light green dress greeted him with a smile from behind the reception
desk.
Klein deliberately touched his stomach and said, “Miss Rozanne, you
shouldn’t be talking about that so early in the morning! I’m already
sick of today’s mission that has yet to arrive. I only hope for the
evening to arrive sooner.”
“Me too.” Rozanne chuckled.
She looked to the left and right, then she beckoned for Klein to come
closer. She lowered her voice and said, “I met Madam Daly earlier.”
“Spirit Medium Madam Daly?” Klein asked in surprise.
The most famous Spirit Medium from Awwa County had been living
at Enmat Harbor all this time, and it wasn’t a short distance from
Tingen.
“Yes.” Rozanne gave a ﬁrm nod and said, “But, she has already left.
Ah, she is my ideal Beyonder. If I were to become a Spirit Medium, I
would leave Tingen and travel all around the world by myself. To
Intis, to Feysac, to Feynapotter, to the Southern Continent; to the vast
prairies, primitive forests, and snow-covered plains!”
Lady, be aware of the Nighthawks’ rules… Klein shook his head in
amusement.
“Even Madam Daly has to apply and obtain permission to leave
Enmat Harbor.”
“I know that, but you can’t just remind me about it now and shatter
my dreams!” Rozanne said peeved. “The truth is, I would never
become a Beyonder. It’s too dangerous. I know when I’ll die from
sudden gunﬁre. From what I’ve seen, Beyonders are basically people
who turn themselves into monsters to ﬁght against monsters.”
“Archbishop Chanis said that we are guardians, but also a bunch of
miserable wretches that are constantly ﬁghting against threats and
madness,” Klein replied, sighing. The quote had left a deep
impression on him.
To ﬁght against the abyss, we have to endure the corruption of the abyss.
The two of them fell silent in unison. Rozanne was the ﬁrst to break
the silence as she pursed her lips towards the partition and said,
“Captain wanted you to meet him when you arrived.”
“Alright.” With his hat and cane in hand, Klein passed through the
partition and entered Dunn’s oﬃce after knocking on the door.
A middle-aged gentleman with deep and serene gray eyes and a high
hairline put down his coﬀee cup and said with a smile.
“Daly was here.”
“Can’t say that I’m surprised; Rozanne had just informed me,” Klein
replied with a smile.
Dunn didn’t mind his humor but sighed.
“Daly was just transferred to the Backlund diocese, which is the
world’s busiest and most crowded city. They have the highest
population of Beyonders and the most opportunities… She has a
higher chance of becoming an archbishop or a senior deacon than
me.”
“Why?” Klein asked curiously as he took a seat.
Dunn thought for nearly twenty seconds before answering, “She has a
unique talent in mastering and exploiting Sequence potions… I’ve
mentioned the internal rule of the Nighthawks before. If you want to
consume the next potion in the Sequence, you’ll have to wait three
years and go through a strict examination to prevent any loss of
control. But typically, three years is far from suﬃcient. I spent three
years going from a Sleepless to a Midnight Poet. It took me nine years
to go from a Midnight Poet to Nightmare—a full nine years. And to
go from Nightmare to Sequence 6, I’ve already spent three years. I
have no idea how many more years I need.
“When our bodies age and our energy starts to decline, even if we
overcome the latent dangers, we shouldn’t attempt advancing
anymore. This is because the risk of losing control at that point is so
high that no one is willing to risk it.
“As for Daly and I, we are diﬀerent from most Beyonders. After she
became a Corpse Collector, she handed in a special application after
only a year. She hoped to consume the follow-up potion immediately.
What surprised everyone was that she actually passed through the
stricter examination and obtained the Gravedigger potion.
“It only took her one more year to go from Gravedigger to Spirit
Medium. Heh, this year will be her ﬁfth year as a Beyonder. She is
only twenty-four this year, young enough to have many opportunities
ahead of her.”
On the surface, she’s the most famous spirit medium in Awwa County, but
she truly is an actual Spirit Medium… Isn’t that acting? Old Neil had
apparently mentioned that Madam Daly had similar tendencies… Klein
felt that he had grasped the key reason for Madam Daly’s quick
ascension through the ranks.
“Captain, you’re young enough as well. You’re only in your thirties,”
Klein comforted Dunn, but added in his heart, It’s just that your
memory isn’t that great…
Dunn drank a sip of his coﬀee. He shook his head and smiled bitterly.
“Why didn’t you ask Madam Daly about her method of mastering and
exploiting Sequence potions?” Klein purposely asked.
Dunn put down his coﬀee cup and massaged his temples as he spoke.
“She told me to become a true Nightmare… I don’t know what that
means.”
Play the role of a Nightmare. Man, a Nightmare sounds sinister… Klein
creased his eyebrows and temporarily fell silent.
Then, Dunn took out his smoking pipe and sniﬀed at it.
“Daly and I discussed the possibility of Seer’s follow-up potion being
Clown. Assuming that the member of the Seers didn’t lie to you, she
brought up an interesting hypothesis.”
“What hypothesis?” Klein asked hurriedly, his eyes turning bright.
He had once used a divination method to determine if Clown was the
follow-up potion of Seer. The answer he received had been vague, but
it seemed close to being a conﬁrmation.
Dunn’s deep and serene gray eyes swept his gaze at him while he said
in thought, “A normal Sequence pathway proceeds in a stepped
manner. They advance according to a particular similarity. For
instance, Sleepless, Midnight Poet, and Nightmare are all obviously
related to the darkness of the night, as well as the peaceful sleep and
tranquility that is generated from sleep. It can be imagined that every
subsequent Sequence would have identical traits, only with more
power and a wider scope. They might be linked to secrets, disaster,
horror, the crimson moon, etc…
“Certain Sequence pathways appear unrelated, but when we analyze
them in detail, we can still ﬁnd similarities, such as Assassin and
Instigator. Their implied similarity is to bring people calamities, pain,
sorrow, and despair. Hence, the follow-up Sequences should abide by
this pattern.”
Klein paid close attention and asked proactively, “But Seer and Clown
doesn’t have such a connection?”
“Yeah.” Dunn nodded and said, “Daly believes that there might be
Sequence pathways that share another kind of relationship. After all,
there’s a lot we do not know.”
He paused for a moment before saying, “Daly said that, in this sort of
pathway, the low to mid Sequence potions would respectively
provide the Beyonder an ability that seems brand new and unrelated
to the others. When the Beyonder reaches a point of qualitative
change, these abilities will mix into an abnormally powerful ‘job’ that
includes them all.”
“In other words, the pathway doesn’t advance step by step, but
instead it’s a relationship of dissection and combination.”
Klein listened intently, but he felt lost. Dunn lifted his right hand and
said, “A normal Sequence pathway advances a bit at a time, just like
a child growing up. A growing child becomes taller, stronger,
heavier, and more mature from a young age.”
“While special Sequence pathways are more like…”
Having said this, Dunn lifted up his thumb.
“This is Sequence 9.”
Then, he lifted up his index ﬁnger.
“This is Sequence 8.”
Then, he gradually lifted up the rest of his ﬁngers.
“Each and every ﬁnger is independent, and doesn’t seem to be related
to the others. But in the end…”
When he said the word ‘end,’ Dunn clenched his ﬁngers into a tight
ﬁst!
“I understand now.” Klein was suddenly enlightened. He agreed with
Lady Daly’s guess and the Captain’s metaphor.
Maybe that’s how it is? He nodded in deep thought.
Sequence 8 Clown and Sequence 9 Seer are completely diﬀerent and have
brand new abilities. And according to the description from the
Nighthawks’ intelligence, the corresponding Sequence 7 and Sequence 8
Clown don’t share any similarities either…
Klein fell silent for a while before curiously pressing on, “At which
stage would the diﬀerent abilities combine to form a qualitative
change?”
Dunn took another sip of coﬀee and chuckled.
“Daly and I guessed Sequence 4!”
“Why?” Klein blurted out.
“Because according to the way the churches categorize Sequences,
Sequence 4 is the beginning point of the higher Sequences. It is said
that merely achieving such a level brings about qualitative changes in
vitality and energy. In ancient times, Sequence 4 Beyonders were
qualiﬁed to be called demigods in the Fourth Epoch. It’s a pity that
such Beyonders are very rare in this era,” Dunn said wistfully.
“If Sequence 4 to Sequence 1 are High-Sequence Beyonders, then who
are the Low-Sequence Beyonders?” Klein asked with interest.
“Sequences 9 through 7 were considered as Low-Sequences a
thousand years ago. But, in recent centuries, Beyonders are few in
number and each church has listed Sequence 7 as a Mid-Sequence.”
Dunn laughed in a self-deprecating manner.
Sequence 9 and Sequence 8 are Low-Sequences. Then, Sequences 7
through 5 are Mid-Sequences. Finally, those Sequence 4 and above
are High-Sequences… Klein repeated in his head and inevitably felt a
yearning for that.
Emperor Roselle was a High-Sequence Beyonder!
However, the higher the Sequence, the greater the risk of losing
control… Klein thought to himself in fear.
He asked as though in a seemingly casual manner, “What is the
Sequence 4 potion for the Church of the Goddess called?”
“In actual fact, I’m not sure. My security clearance isn’t high enough
for me to be privy to that information. I’ll be able to read them when
I become a diocese bishop or Nighthawks deacon.” Dunn shook his
head and smiled. “In fact, at least half of the Church’s thirteen
archbishops and nine senior deacons at the top of the Church’s
hierarchy are below Sequence 4. Hmm, that’s just me being
optimistic. The archbishop Ince Zangwill, who became wanted, lost
control when he tried to advance to Sequence 4.”
The one who stole Sealed Artifact ‘0-08?’ His potion was apparently
called Gatekeeper… Klein thought and probed, “Is Sleepless Sequence
5 Gatekeeper?”
“No, that’s in Spirit Medium’s pathway. You’ll be allowed to access
that information when you reach Sequence 7 and become a bishop or
a Captain of a Nighthawks team.”
Gatekeeper is Sequence 5 of the Spirit Medium pathway? Does it mean
that it’s keeping watch over the gates to Hell? Or keeping watch over the
gates to the Spirit World? Klein guessed.
“Alright, go to Old Neil and continue with your studies.” Dunn smiled
and said, “Don’t forget about dinner tonight, at Old Will’s Restaurant.
Reservations have been made. I’ll introduce you to the rest of the
Nighthawks oﬃcially.”
“Alright, I’ve already prepared the money.” Klein forced a smile.
“No, there’s no need. Have you forgotten that we have additional
bonuses? The part about you completing an assigned mission.” Dunn
waved.
Klein was momentarily taken aback before replying with a beaming
smile, “Alright, Captain.”
He turned around and walked towards the door, while counting
inwardly,Three, two, one… Eh, why didn’t Captain call me back?
Klein dragged out “one” for a very long time, only to be surprised
that Captain Dunn Smith hadn’t forgotten add anything.
A miracle…
…
In the armory, Old Neil stole a glance at Klein, who was in a good
mood.
“Don’t be obsessed with tonight’s dinner. You still have a lot of things
to learn, such as more ritualistic magic, ancient Hermes, Dragonish,
Elvish, and many more.”
“Yeah, every afternoon besides your day oﬀ, you have to have at
least two hours of combat training with an instructor.”
“Combat training? Captain didn’t mention it…” Klein was shocked.
Old Neil nodded and didn’t hesitate to answer, “He forgot.”
Chapter 97: Combat Teacher
At two in the afternoon, outside of a simple two-storied building that
was in disrepair at the outskirts of the North Borough.
Klein, who was in his probationary inspector uniform, looked at the
weed-ﬁlled garden and the vines that had crept up the walls. He
turned his head in surprise.
“My combat instructor lives here?”
Shouldn’t a combat artist who was selected by the Nighthawks be
exceptional…
Leonard Mitchell, who had guided Klein there, snickered and said,
“Don’t underestimate Mr. Gawain because of his residence’s
surroundings. Although he was never conferred an aristocratic title,
he was a true knight back in the day.”
Having said that, the poetic Nighthawk, who was dressed in a white
shirt, black trousers, and buttonless leather boots suddenly felt
melancholic.
“He was active during the waning era of the knights. The warriors
donning their armors would storm through enemy ranks despite the
gunﬁre and cannon ﬁre, destroying their enemies and redeﬁning the
battle lines. But alas, they were quickly met with the invention of the
high-pressure steam guns and six-barrel machine guns. From then on,
the knights had to gradually step down.
“Mr. Gawain met the same fate. More than twenty years ago, the
Awwa Knights’ Order of Chivalry faced the most advanced weaponry
of the Intis Republic army… Sigh, every time I recall this, it seems
like I’m touching the dust heaps of history. The poet in me stirs when
thinking of this irreversible and fated destiny, but alas, I do not know
how to compose the poem.”
…Then what’s the point in saying so much? Klein acted oblivious to
Leonard’s self-deprecation and gave a serious suggestion, “My
university schoolmate once told me that the composing of poems
requires a certain degree of talent. It’s best you start by reading the
Classical Poems Anthology of the Loen Kingdom.”
Leonard’s mood changed on a whim. He replied with a light-hearted
tone, “I purchased that book a long time ago, as well as other titles,
such as the Selected Poems of Emperor Roselle. I will work hard to
become a true Midnight Poet, Mr. Seer”
Is he hinting at the… acting method? Klein replied, as though he
couldn’t understand him, “You would still need books on grammar.”
“Alright, let’s enter.” Leonard extended his hand and pushed open the
half-closed metallic gates. The two of them then followed the path
towards the house.
They were still a distance away from the house when Klein saw a tall
man walking out from behind the main door.
He had short blond hair, his brows already laced with white hairs.
His facial features looked like they had been ravaged through age, his
wrinkles were etched deep across his face.
“What are you doing here?” the aged man asked in a deep voice.
“Mr. Gawain, as per your contract with the police department, this
probationary inspector will be learning the art of combat under your
guidance,” Leonard explained with a smile.
“Combat? There’s no need to study combat in this era.” Gawain
looked at Klein with turbid eyes and said in a dead voice, “You
should learn how to draw your gun and shoot. You should master the
most advanced weaponry.”
Was this the psychological trauma caused by the six-barrel machine guns
and high-pressure steam guns? Klein didn’t give a reckless reply;
instead, he smiled and looked at Leonard.
“The art of combat is still a skill a policeman has to master. Most of
the criminals we face are not those who must be executed on the
spot. Some might not even have weapons. In that case, we have to
rely on combat techniques,” Leonard said, obviously prepared for the
situation.
With a dark expression, Gawain fell silent for more than ten seconds
before saying, “Throw a punch.”
He was speaking to Klein.
Klein, who was not holding his cane, remembered the boxing
matches he had seen in his previous life. He raised his arm and threw
it forward.
Gawain’s lips twitched indiscernibly. He thought for a moment and
said, “Kick.”
Tilting to the side slightly and twisting his hips, Klein tightened his
thigh muscles and kicked forward with his right foot.
Cough… Gawain covered his mouth and cleared his throat. He looked
at Leonard and said, “I will honor my contract. But based on his
foundation, he needs to come here four times a week, three hours
each time, for the ﬁrst month.”
“You’re the combat expert. It’s up to you.” Leonard nodded without
hesitation. He smiled and said to Klein, “See you at dinner.”
After Leonard walked out the metallic gates, Klein asked out of
curiosity, “Instructor, how should I begin practicing? Punching, or
footwork?”
As a qualiﬁed keyboard warrior, he understood the importance of
footwork in combat.
Gawain stood akimbo as he shook his head lethargically.
“What you need now is strength training.
“See those? Those are two dumbbells made of steel. They shall be
your partners for today.
“Other than that, you also have to practice deep squats, running, and
rope-skipping. Let us take those one set at a time.”
While Klein was still in a daze, Gawain suddenly raised his voice and
said sternly, “Understood?”
“Understood!” At this moment, Klein felt as though he had returned
to military training and was facing an inhumane instructor.
“Change out of your clothes. There’s a set of knight’s training clothes
on the sofa.” Gawain suddenly sighed. He turned around and walked
toward the black steel dumbbells.
…
Six in the evening, at a corner table of the Old Will Restaurant.
Other than Frye, who was guarding Chanis Gate, all the members of
the Blackthorn Security Company were present. There were six
Nighthawks and ﬁve civilian staﬀ.
A white tablecloth was draped over the long table. Waiters carried
over plates of food, portioned them before serving them to each
individual guest.
Klein saw steaks drenched in black pepper sauce. He saw bacon,
sausages paired with mashed potatoes, egg puddings, asparagus, and
specialty cheeses. He even saw rose-colored champagne. However, he
had no appetite. The training in the afternoon had nearly made him
vomit.
Noticing the pale, newly-inducted Nighthawk with turbid eyes, Dunn
raised the glass of red wine in front of him and laughed.
“Let us welcome our newest oﬃcial member, Klein Moretti, cheers!”
The cold and introverted black-haired lady, Royale Reideen, the
Sleepless Kenley White, the sloppy Leonard Mitchell, as well as the
white-haired, black-eyed Midnight Poet Seeka Tron all raised their
cups and looked at the new member of their team.
Klein fought back the discomfort of the training and raised his glass
of amber champagne. He stood and said, “Thank you.”
He clinked glasses with every Nighthawk, tilted his head back, and
ﬁnished the small amount of champagne.
“Is our Miss Author not going to say something on this occasion?”
Dunn smiled as he looked at Seeka Tron.
Seeka Tron was a lady in her thirties. She had average looks, but had
an exceptional demeanor, one that was quiet and serene. Coupled
with her few strands of graying hair, it added a unique charm to her.
Klein had heard Old Neil mention that this Midnight Poet had taken
on a side job as an author and had attempted to submit her works to
newspapers and magazines. Unfortunately, only a few smaller
newspapers had accepted them.
Seeka smiled and looked at Dunn.
“In order to make the term ‘Miss Author’ into a reality, Captain, I
think you should give me some funds to self-publish my work.”
Dunn laughed.
“You should learn from Old Neil and give me a more suitable
reason.”
“I’m most impressed with Mr. Neil in this department!” Rozanne
echoed in-between her mouthfuls of roast mutton.
Amidst the chatter and laughter, Leonard looked at Klein and said
with a chuckle, “Are you so tired that you have no appetite to eat?”
“Yeah.” Klein sighed.
“If you haven’t touched your food yet, I can be of assistance.”
Leonard acted as though he didn’t want to waste any food.
Klein didn’t mind. He nodded and said, “That wouldn’t be an issue.”
And with that, a good portion of the food in front of him was eaten
by Leonard and the rest.
Nearing the end of the dinner, the waiters served plates of beef
pudding and ice-cream.
Klein tasted ice-cream and found it cold and sweet. It was
particularly appetizing.
Before he realized it, he had ﬁnished the ice-cream drizzled with a
blueberry sauce.
And as a result of this, he started to feel the hunger pangs. It was a
hunger which demanded recharging food that came after intense
exertion.
Swallowing his saliva, Klein looked to the front, only to see that all
the plates were empty. There were no leftovers.
“Let’s end the dinner here, and give Klein a ﬁnal toast,” Dunn
suggested.
Before ﬁnishing his sentence, Klein asked, “Captain, may I order
another plate of food?”
The group fell silent after hearing such a request, only to break out
into chuckles moments later.
“Haha, you’ve ﬁnally recovered. No problem, order two plates if you
want to.” Dunn shook his head and laughed.
While patiently waiting an unbearable amount of time, Klein heard
his stomach growling.
Finally, a freshly prepared black pepper steak was served before him.
His fork and knife danced as Klein ﬁnished the medium-done steak in
ninety seconds, tears nearly falling from his eyes. The meat juices and
the fragrance of the sauce lingered in his mouth.
Sometime later, Klein let out a satisﬁed sigh as he looked at his
empty plate. He put down his knife and fork and took a sip of his
champagne.
“Waiter, the bill please.” Dunn turned around and called for the
waiter.
The waiter went to the counter, then returned with the check. He
gave a thorough breakdown,
“You opened ﬁve bottles of Desi Champagne, each bottle being
twelve soli and three pence, a small glass of Southville Red Wine for
ten pence… Each black pepper beef steak was one soli two pence…
Each serving of beef pudding was six pence, the servings of ice cream
was one soli each… The total would be ﬁve pounds, nine soli, and six
pence.”
Five pounds, nine soli, and six pence? That’s nearly my weekly salary! A
restaurant is indeed much more expensive than eating at home! Klein
clicked his tongue upon hearing that. He felt lucky that the Captain
had said that he didn’t need to pay out of his own pocket. They had
some petty cash from bonus earnings!
He calculated the cost carefully and noticed that the most expensive
portion of the meal was the alcohol. Five bottles of champagne had
cost more than three pounds!
This is no diﬀerent from Earth… Klein secretly rubbed his stomach and
forced down the last of his champagne.
…
The next morning, Klein felt bloated. He tried to get oﬀ the bed in his
sleepy stupor.
Just as he exerted strength, he was instantly awakened by his aching
muscles. He felt as though his body wasn’t under his control.
“What a familiar feeling… It’s the same as that day after we got
punished with frog jumps. Today is a rest day, but I still have to pay
a visit to my mentor and see if I can borrow the monograph on the
Hornacis main peak from the library at the University…” Klein’s lips
twitched as he made his way outside with some eﬀort.
He wanted to draw a gasp with every step.
“Klein, what happened to you?” Melissa, who had just come out of
the bathroom, sized up her brother suspiciously for his odd posture
and slow movement.
Chapter 98: Mr. Azik
Faced with his sister’s question, all Klein could do was reply with a
regretful smile, “Sore muscles.”
He originally believed that by consuming the Sequence potion, his
constitution would be enhanced as a Beyonder, but the harsh reality
told him that a Seer’s stats points were all allocated to his spirituality,
mind, intuition, and interpretation. It didn’t aid him in adjusting to
combat training quickly.
As for the original Klein, he had focused on his studies early on and
had suﬀered from malnutrition. That led him to possess a below-
average physical condition. The fact that he was having ‘after eﬀects’
from working out was to be expected.
“Sore muscles? I remember you returning after dinner last night and
you didn’t do anything else… Does alcohol cause sore muscles?”
Melissa inquired with an inquisitive look.
Does alcohol cause sore muscles… Sis, that question… can’t help but
make me have inappropriate thoughts… Klein laughed dryly and said,
“No, this has nothing to do with alcohol. It was from yesterday
afternoon. I joined the company’s combat training.”
“Combat?” Melissa was even more astonished.
Klein organized his thoughts and said, “Well, this is what happened. I
considered it and believe that as a historical and relic consultant of a
security company, it’s impossible for me to stay in the oﬃce or port
warehouse forever. Perhaps there will come a day when I have to
accompany them to the villages or an ancient castle, to the site of
some relic. That might require me to hike, to cross rivers, and to walk
a lot. I’ll have to endure all sorts of tests posed by nature, so I have to
possess a suﬃciently healthy body.”
“So you joined combat training to enhance your stamina?” Melissa
seemed to understand her brother’s intention.
“That’s right,” Klein answered with great aﬃrmation.
Melissa said with a frown, “But that isn’t gentlemanly… Don’t you
always keep yourself to the standards of a professor? A professor only
requires the ability to read historical documents, ponder over diﬃcult
questions, and maintain a polite and gentlemanly demeanor.
“Of course, I’m not saying that those aren’t all good things. I prefer
men who can solve problems on their own, regardless of whether that
solution requires brawn or brain.”
Melissa smiled.
Klein smiled and said, “No, no, no, Melissa. Your deﬁnition of a
professor contains a misconception. A true professor can
communicate with people gently and politely, but he can also
educate the other person using the principles of physics by raising a
cane to convince someone when there is an obstacle in
communication.”
“Principles of physics…” Melissa was momentarily at a loss, but she
quickly understood what her brother was saying. She was suddenly
unable to retort him.
Klein didn’t say anything more but widened his pace with great
diﬃculty as he headed for the bathroom.
Melissa stood there and looked for a few seconds. She suddenly shook
her head and caught up to Klein.
“Do you need my help?”
She posed as if she was supporting someone.
“No, there’s no need to. I was hamming it up a bit earlier.” Klein felt
humiliated. He suddenly stood straight and walked normally.
Watching her brother walk steadily to the washroom and close the
door, Melissa pursed her lips and muttered, “Klein is getting more
and more pretentious… I even believed that his muscle soreness was
really that serious…”
In the bathroom, Klein stood behind the tightly shut door, his face
suddenly contorting in pain.
Ouch, ouch, ouch… He held his breath, tensed his body, and stood
there for a good seven or eight seconds.
When he ﬁnally went downstairs with great eﬀort, had breakfast, and
saw Benson and Melissa oﬀ, his soreness ﬁnally began to ease.
After resting for a little while, Klein took his cane, donned his top
hat, and left the house, strolling towards the public carriage stop.
…
During the summer, Khoy University had trees with shade-providing
foliage, ﬂourishing with birds and luxuriant ﬂowers. It was peaceful
and calm.
Walking along the river, Klein took a turn towards the history
department. Then, he found the three-story building which showed
its age and located his mentor’s, Cohen Quentin’s, oﬃce.
He knocked and entered the room, but he was shocked to see that the
man sitting at his mentor’s seat was the academic, Azik.
“Good morning, Mr. Azik, Where’s my mentor? We made an
appointment by letter to meet here at ten,” Klein asked, puzzled.
Azik, who was Cohen Quentin’s best friend and often debated with
his mentor regarding academic topics, smiled and said, “Cohen had a
last minute meeting and went to Tingen University. He asked me to
wait for you here.”
He had bronze skin, an average height and build, black hair, brown
eyes, and gentle facial features. Being in his presence brought on an
indescribable feeling, as though you could see in the man’s eyes that
he had been through the vicissitudes of life. Under his right ear was a
tiny mole that one wouldn’t notice unless closely examined.
Having said the reason, Azik suddenly frowned as he carefully
observed Klein.
Feeling confused by the sudden scrutiny, Klein looked at his attire.
“Have I committed some breach of etiquette?”
Tuxedo, black vest, white shirt, black bow tie, dark colored trousers,
leather boots with no buttons… Everything seems normal…
Azik’s brows eased and he chuckled softly.
“Don’t mind me. I suddenly noticed that you are way more energetic
than before. You look even more like a gentleman now.”
“Thank you for your compliment.” Klein accepted it calmly and
asked, “Mr. Azik, did my mentor manage to ﬁnd the book ‘Research
of the Hornacis Main Peak’s Relics’ in the school library?”
“He found it with my assistance,” Azik said, smiling gently. He then
pulled open the drawer and took out a gray-covered book. “You are
no longer a Khoy University student anymore. You can read it here,
but you cannot take it home.”
“Alright.” Klein delightfully took the academic monograph, and with
a hint of fear.
The book’s design was fully in-line with the current trends; it used
hard paper as a hardcover and it was printed with an image like an
abstract version of the main peak of Hornacis mountain range.
Klein took a glance and found a seat. He ﬂipped open the book and
started reading carefully, line by line.
As he became engrossed in the book, he suddenly realized that there
was a cup of rich and fragrant coﬀee by his side.
“Help yourself to the sugar and milk.” Azik put down the silver
saucer and pointed at the milk jar and sugar container.
“Thank you.” Klein nodded with gratitude.
He added three cubes of sugar and a teaspoon of milk before
continuing to read his book.
The book, Research of the Hornacis Main Peak’s Relics, was not a
very thick book. Klein ﬁnished reading it when it was almost noon.
He took note of a few noteworthy points.
First, the settlement on the main peak of Hornacis Mountain and its
surrounding area was obviously an advanced civilization, which existed as
part of an ancient nation.
Second, from their wall murals, their perspective on life appears similar to
that of humans. I can assume for now that they were human.
Third, they revered yet feared the darkness of the night. Hence, they called
their god the Ruler of the Evernight, Mother of the Sky.
Fourth, the weirdest part is that researchers haven’t found any graves in
the entire area, which initially seems to indicate that the people didn’t
need to be buried, because they didn’t die. However, that would be
contradictory to the contents of the wall murals. In the wall murals, the
people in the nation believed that death is not the end. They believed that
their deceased family would protect them in the night. Hence, they would
keep their deceased family members at home, on the bed, by their side, for
a full three days.
There is nothing beyond that for the wall murals as it doesn’t involve
burials.
Klein took another sip of coﬀee and continued to write down his
‘afterthoughts’ in his notebook.
Mother of the Sky, Skymother is such a grand title, while the Ruler of the
Evernight obviously overlaps with the Evernight Goddess… Is this a
contradiction at its roots?
In the ancient remains on the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range
and its surrounding area, every arrangement and decoration was well-
preserved. Even the wall murals didn’t have any signs of damage. Before it
was discovered, there seemed to be no disturbance at all… The table was
arranged with cutlery, and there were dried stains of rot on the dining
plates… In some rooms, there were half-ﬁlled bottles of alcohol that had
almost turned into plain water…
What happened to the nation’s people? They seemed to have left their
homes in a hurry, without taking anything with them, and they never
returned.
Considering how there are no burial grounds, this only makes it weirder.
The author, Mr. Joseph, also mentioned that when he ﬁrst discovered the
remains, he even had the belief that the people residing there had just
vanished all of a sudden.
Klein stopped writing and cast his gaze at an illustration.
On John Joseph’s third visit to the main peak of the Hornacis
mountain range, he had used a new camera model to shoot a
monochrome photograph.
In the photo, the lofty palace had a collapsed wall and was
overgrown with weeds. It followed a grandeur style for its design.
When he ﬂipped to the photograph, Klein’s ﬁrst thought was that of
the palace he had seen in his dream.
The two styles were identical. The only diﬀerence was that the one
he had dreamed of was on a peak and it was way more magniﬁcent.
It also had a huge chair—a seat of honor—that looked like it didn’t
seat a human. Countless translucent maggots clustered together and
squirmed slowly beneath the chair.
I can conﬁrm that my dream is related to the ancient remains on the main
peak of the Hornacis mountain range… That should be the Nation of the
Evernight which was referenced in the Antigonus family’s notebook…
Klein nodded slightly and closed the book.
At that moment, Azik, who was sitting opposite him touched the
inconspicuous mole under his right ear and said, “How was it? Found
anything?”
“Quite a bit. Take a look, I’ve written so many pages of notes.” Klein
pointed at the table and smiled.
“I don’t understand why you’re suddenly so interested in this matter.”
Azik sighed and said, “Klein, when I was studying at the Backlund
University, I had dabbled with some divination and did quite a bit of
research on that. Well, I discovered that there is disharmony… in
your fate.”
What? Divination? Are you talking to me about divination? As a Seer,
Klein looked at Azik the academic in amusement.
“How is it disharmonious?”
Azik thought for a moment.
“Have you encountered many strange coincidences in the past two
months?”
“Coincidences?” As he was indebted to Mr. Azik, Klein didn’t dispute
his question as he subconsciously began thinking.
If we are talking about coincidences, the most obvious matter was when
we were after kidnappers. We actually managed to ﬁnd clues of the
Antigonus family’s notebook that was lost for days in the room opposite
the kidnappers.
Also, Ray Bieber didn’t ﬂee from Tingen in a hurry; instead, he found a
place to digest the power bestowed by the notebook, allowing for Sealed
Artifact 2-049 to track him down easily. That seemed to be against
common sense. Although Aiur Harson gave a reasonable explanation, I
always had a nagging feeling that it was somewhat coincidental…
Oh, Selena had stolen a glance at Hanass Vincent’s secret incantations,
but she held back till her birthday dinner banquet to try it out, and I
happened to discover it, which is quite a coincidence too. Otherwise,
Hanass Vincent wouldn’t have been the only one to die so suddenly…
Klein thought about it seriously for a few minutes and said, “There
are three. Neither too many, nor too frequent. Furthermore, there
was nothing that indicated someone’s involvement and guidance.”
Azik nodded slightly.
“As Emperor Roselle once said, a single coincidence is encountered
by anyone. Twice is still normal. Thrice is when one should consider
what internal factors are inﬂuencing those coincidences.”
“Can you tell me anything else?” Klein probed.
Azik laughed and shook his head.
“I can only tell that there’s some disharmony, but nothing else. You
have to understand that I’m not a real seer.”
Isn’t that basically equal to saying nothing… Mr. Azik is quite odd… He’s
playing a charlatan in front of a charlatan like me… Klein let out a
breath, seizing the moment when Azik stood up, he pinched his
glabella and activated his Spirit Vision.
When he looked over, Azik’s aura fully appeared before his eyes and
everything seemed fairly normal.
Unfortunately, I can only see the Ether Body and Astral Projection of a
person above the gray fog… Klein thought carefreely as he tapped his
glabella again whilst standing up.
Chapter 99: Red Chimney
Late in the afternoon, Klein returned home and drew the curtains,
allowing his room to slip into darkness.
He took out his pen and paper and thought for a long time, ﬁnally
writing down a sentence: “The kidnapping of Elliott was due to
extraordinary elements.”
As a Seer, Klein had tried to divine if those coincidences were a
consequence of unnatural developments, but the results showed
otherwise.
This time, he was inﬂuenced by Azik to look into these events again.
He also drew lessons from the suited clown. He seriously designed an
appropriate divination statement, eliminating any descriptions that
might be vague or cause confusion.
“Yes, I should break down the three coincidences and divine them
separately…” Klein nodded in thought as he slowly removed the
topaz from his wrist.
He held the spirit pendulum with his left hand and allowed it to hang
close over the divination statement on the paper.
He collected himself and entered a state of Cogitation. With his eyes
closed, Klein started chanting repeatedly, “The kidnapping of Elliott
was due to extraordinary elements.”
…
As he recited the statement over and over again, Klein opened his
eyes and looked at the pendulum, only to see the topaz turning
counterclockwise slowly.
“It’s still a negative…” Klein muttered to himself. He designed several
other divination statements, but the results persisted—there was
nothing strange about that incident.
He then separately divined the “event of Ray Bieber’s stay in Tingen”
and “Selena’s magic mirror divination incident,” but the answers for
both events were normal.
Heh, was I, a real Seer, frightened by the charlatan Mr. Azik? Besides,
Captain and the others didn’t feel that anything was oﬀ… Klein
laughed and shook his head. But he remained cautious. He planned
on using the dream divination technique to get a ﬁnal conﬁrmation.
After some thought, he changed the divination statement to ﬁt the
change in method.
“The true reason for Elliott’s kidnapping.” As he scribbled with the
fountain pen, Klein paused and pondered over his words.
After reading it over and over again, he tore the slip of paper and
walked toward his bed. He relaxed and laid down.
With the divination statement in hand, Klein quickly fell asleep with
the help of Cogitation.
He found himself in a contorted, broken world. Regaining his senses,
he began swimming through the blur.
Gradually, he saw the few kidnappers. He saw them lose their ﬁnal
chip at a gambling table, saw them obtain guns from underground
sources, and saw them survey the area. They even rented the
apartment across Ray Bieber’s apartment as their hideout…
These didn’t form a continuous scene, instead, they were presented in
the form of ﬂashing pictures. Klein couldn’t ﬁnd anything that was
abnormal.
Furthermore, it had also aligned with the statements given by the
kidnappers.
After exiting the dream, Klein separately divined the other two
incidents but had the same result. Their developments followed logic.
The coincidences were really coincidences.
“I was indeed overthinking things. Mr. Azik is merely a divination
enthusiast…” Klein stabilized his pendulum and shook his head with
a bitter smile.
He was about to draw the curtains and allow sunlight into the room
when he froze.
“From the original Klein’s impression of Mr. Azikc, he is a
dependable and trustworthy person. He had never once said anything
baseless. Even if he was always quarreling with Mentor, it was
limited to academic topics, and each of them had their reasons… If
he was truly a mere divination enthusiast, he wouldn’t have
interacted with me like that… And the memories of original Klein has
nothing about him liking divination… Of course, this could be due to
the loss of a corresponding memories…” Klein frowned and couldn’t
ease his worries. He needed a way to conﬁrm this.
He suspected that Mr. Azik had unwittingly come across some insider
information and was trying to remind him by using divination as an
excuse.
“How should I conﬁrm this?” Klein paced back and forth across the
dark room, trying to recall the other divination techniques he knew.
One step, two steps, three steps. He suddenly halted as an idea came
to him.
“Let’s assume that these coincidences are dubious. I’m unable to
divine a result either because my Sequence isn’t high enough or I’m
being aﬀected by outside interference, but I can change my
environment! I can change my environment to someplace that is even
more mysterious and even harder to understand.” Klein felt pumped.
He pulled open his drawer and took out a silver dagger.
He concentrated and allowed his spirituality to ﬂow out from the tip
of the dagger, becoming one with his surroundings.
With each step he took, the wall of spirituality sealed oﬀ the entire
room.
Klein planned on doing the divination above the gray fog, to do the
divination in that mysterious world!
…
In the magniﬁcent ancient divine hall above the endless gray fog.
Klein sat at the seat of honor on one end of the bronze table. Before
him was a piece of goatskin he willed into existence.
He lifted a pen and tried writing the divination statement as he had
previously.
“The kidnapping of Elliott was due to extraordinary elements.”
He held the spirit pendulum and hung it low. Klein quickly composed
himself as he turned silent and ethereal.
Half-closing his eyes, he recited the statement seven times, using his
spirituality to interact with the spiritual world that stood above all.
Feeling the tug of the silver chain, Klein opened his eyes to look at
the pendulum.
The sight made him freeze immediately.
The pendulum was spinning clockwise!
This meant that there was an extraordinary element behind Elliott’s
kidnapping!
This was completely diﬀerent from the result he had gotten in the
outside world!
There were no traces of any interference… Such power or means is
terrifying… What’s the motive of the person behind this? Is my fate
intertwined with the Antigonus family’s diary? Klein was immensely
shocked. He lost his calm and the rotation of the pendulum slipped
into chaos.
He put down the topaz and rubbed his glabella. His expression was
abnormally grave.
After contemplating for a few seconds, he didn’t attempt to divine the
other two events. Instead, he wrote a new divination statement: “The
true reason for Elliott’s kidnapping.”
He held the paper in his hand and recited the statement seven times.
Klein leaned back and fell into sleep above the fog.
Soon, he saw a boundless, illusory grayish-white fog.
The fog dissipated slowly, revealing a colorful grass plain ﬁlled with
ﬂowers.
The space behind the ﬂowers and the plains was folding into itself,
like a monster that had come alive.
Klein tried his best to look forward, barely making out an image of a
dark red chimney.
At this point, the scene before him shattered, putting an end to his
dream.
Klein abruptly straightened his back in the majestic divine hall. His
heart was beating wildly without reason.
Phew… It felt like I had just spied on a terrifying thing… He took in
two deep breaths to stabilize his chaotic emotions.
Tap. Tap. Tap. Klein tapped on the side of the table sometime later
and slipped into deep thought.
Red chimney… garden… grass plains… How is this related to the
person behind all of this? I cannot determine his motive from the
coincidences, nor can I conclude that there is any evil intent…
In the midst of this thinking, Klein felt alarmed, for himself, Captain,
Frye, and the others.
We are like puppets dancing on a string. What’s even scarier is that
we thought so highly of ourselves…
Sigh… I don’t know how to raise this matter to Captain. Old Neil’s
divination produced the same results as mine in the outside world…
If they asked me to conﬁrm it in front of them, I have no way of
doing that… Klein rubbed his temples as if he had a headache.
After nearly twenty seconds of calm, he began divining the “event of
Ray Bieber’s stay in Tingen.” Similarly, he ﬁrst used spirit dowsing.
This time, Klein was shocked to see his topaz hang motionless. It was
neither a conﬁrmation or rejection of the statement.
“Strange…” he muttered. He started to guess the reasons for this
phenomenon, “The person behind this has sensed my divinations and
engaged in countermeasures?”
Following this, he tried the dream divination technique, but all he
saw were fragmented pieces of fog. He no longer made any new
discoveries.
The results of “Selena’s magic mirror divination incident” were the
same.
Klein could almost conﬁrm his conjecture at this point. Since he had
no way of notifying Captain Dunn Smith for the time being, he had
an unprecedented motivation to improve his abilities.
“I must head to the Divination Club later and quickly succeed in my
‘acting’ to digest the Seer potion… Also, I have to conﬁrm whether
the Clown potion is indeed the subsequent Sequence of Seer, as well
as gather clues about it… In addition, I have to interact more with
Mr. Azik and see if I can dig up whatever inside information he
holds…” Klein held his forehead with his right palm and quickly
drew up a plan, and determined his focal point.
After some thought, a goatskin appeared in front of him again. He
picked up his pen and wrote:
“The corresponding Sequence 8 of Sequence 9 Seer is Clown.”
From his prior experience, the present Klein was completely
convinced that his divination abilities were augmented and enhanced
above the gray fog.
“Just like how raids are usually successful… is this the result of
having good luck?” he muttered and picked up his spirit pendulum.
Sometime later, Klein received a deﬁnitive answer:
The corresponding Sequence 8 of Sequence 9 Seer was Clown!
He then wrote on the paper once again.
“The corresponding Sequences 8, 7, 6, and 5 of Seer would grant at
least one brand new, unrelated power.”
Klein exhaled as he tried spirit dowsing again.
However, he saw the topaz hang motionlessly without any rotations.
“There isn’t enough information to complete the divination and
receive a revelation?” he muttered to himself while seemingly deep
in thought. Then, he set down the silver chain and began considering
the required statement for a dream divination.
Nearly twenty seconds later, he picked up his fountain pen and wrote
seriously: “Clues to the Clown potion.”
Chapter 100: Interpreting
Symbols
“Clues to the Clown potion.”
…
On the seat of honor at the ancient bronze table, Klein repeated the
divination statement a few times before leaning back and entering a
deep sleep.
His surroundings quickly became peaceful and quiet. He saw a hazy
view, with countless distorted and blurry scenes ﬂashing past, just
like drops of morning dew on tender ﬂower petals.
Gradually, Klein grasped his spirituality and came to his senses.
He saw a ﬁreplace before him with a rocking chair in front of it.
Sitting on it was an old woman dressed in black and white.
Although he couldn’t see her face since she was hanging her head
low, Klein’s gut feeling told him that she was an old lady. And he was
pretty certain about it.
The old lady was facing a desk directly. There were newspapers and
tin cans inlaid with silver on the desk.
“This is…” Klein found the scene before his eyes very familiar, and
he quickly recognized what he saw.
This was where Ray Bieber and his mother stayed!
This was where he saw a bloated cadaver for the ﬁrst time!
“There are clues that point to the Clown potion here?” Just as Klein’s
thoughts ﬂashed past, the scene around him transformed.
It was a grayish-white warehouse, hidden among identical buildings.
There were white bones scattered all around, and a few balls of ﬂesh
that looked like they had been squashed by a boulder.
In the middle of the warehouse was a grayish-white object that was
the size of a ﬁst. Its surface was ﬁlled with ditches and it looked soft
but ductile. It looked like a brain that had been extracted out of a
living being.
Just as Klein recognized the scene and recalled something, the scene
before him distorted like rippling water before transforming into
another new blurry scene.
A naked body was laid on a long table covered with a white cloth.
There were some bluish, discolored patches on the corpse’s skin.
Klein suddenly knitted his eyebrows and muttered, “It was ﬁrst the
images of Ray Bieber’s hiding place and his remains, and now, it’s
related to the brand on the suited clown’s wrist?”
Just as he attempted to speculate what the scenes meant, the scene
suddenly changed again.
A marble coﬀee table, a set of two leather couches, and a chandelier
that hung high on the ceiling.
There were three people—Klein Moretti, who had black hair, brown
eyes, and a scholarly temperament; a wealthy man with a chubby
body and pale skin; and a beautiful young lady with ﬁshnet gloves.
Following that, it was another three people and an object—a middle-
aged man in a black robe who had thick spiky brown hair; a wealthy
man with a chubby body and pale skin; a half-century-old elder with
messy eyebrows, thin brown hair, and gray-blue eyes; and a black
notebook on the round table in-between all of them, a notebook that
exuded an ancient and distant air.
The Antigonus family’s notebook!
Klein suddenly sat up straight and the dream vanished.
Looking outside the divine hall where there was boundless gray fog
and crimson stars, he thought in both shock and confusion.
I was divining for clues to the Clown potion… Why would the Antigonus
family’s notebook show up?
Let me think, let me think, that chubby guy was Welch. Yes, Welch, an
unfortunate fella who bought the Antigonus family’s notebook and
triggered a sequence of incidents… The beautiful young lady wearing
ﬁshnet gloves was Naya…
I remember, the marble coﬀee table and leather couch combination is a
hallmark of Welch’s place. I saw Spirit Medium Daly there.
In other words, what I saw was Welch’s living room. It was a scene where
the original Klein and his two classmates were discussing the notebook.
Klein calmed himself down and tapped on the edge of the long
bronze table rhythmically.
Then, what does the last scene represent? The notebook appeared, Welch
appeared. Could it be the scene where he bought the ancient item?
There were another two people, and one of them looked very familiar. I
feel like I’ve seen the middle-aged man in the classic black robe
somewhere before… That spiky brown hair, severe dark eye circles… Yes,
I know who is he now. Hanass Vincent from the Divination Club, the
Hanass Vincent who ‘died peacefully’ after Captain snuck into his dream,
having learned that Selena secretly obtained the secret incantation from
him!
No way, he was the one that sold the notebook to Welch?
Everything appears to be coming full circle. The world sure is small, no—
Tingen is really small! On careful thought, it really is a possibility that
Hanass Vincent wasn’t an ordinary fortune-teller. He was obviously deep
into mysticism and obtained the attention of an ancient evil god. He had
the channels, ability, and opportunity to acquire the notebook that was
accidentally released by the Secret Order…
It’s no wonder Captain and company never ﬁgured out where Welch
bought the notebook. Their investigative approach was entirely wrong.
They had attempted to investigate via the antique market… But when the
actual whereabouts of the notebook was found, they gave up on that lead.
What a pity, Hanass Vincent just passed away not too long ago.
Otherwise, we deﬁnitely could’ve found out something regarding the
notebook… Since he was involved in mysticism, he should’ve researched
the notebook… His death was way too coincidental!
However, there was another person at the scene, a man in his ﬁfties. He
might know quite a bit of what happened.
Klein stopped tapping his ﬁngers on the edge of the table and looked
through every scene of his dream divination once more.
Ray Bieber’s house, Ray Bieber’s hideout spot, the remains of Ray Bieber,
the brand on the suited clown’s wrist, Welch’s house; Welch, Naya, and
original Klein’s exchange; Welch, Hanass Vincent, and the Antigonus
family notebook’s ‘group photo’. Hehe, besides the brand on the suited
clown, everything else is directly related to the Antigonus family’s
notebook!
But I had divined for clues to the Clown potion… This isn’t scientiﬁc, nor
does it make mystical sense!
After becoming a Seer, Klein once tried to divine where Welch had
bought the Antigonus family’s notebook, but he never considered
using the unique qualities that the area above the gray fog possessed.
As such, he had failed to receive any revelations, but now, he had
chanced upon the truth by divining something separate.
After spending nearly twenty seconds to calm down, Klein
summarized the context provided by Roselle’s diary and attempted to
interpret his dream divination.
The ﬁrst possibility: Zaratul or should I say, the Secret Order, was
searching and pursuing the relics of the Antigonus family. So, the symbolic
meaning of the dream is to use matters related to the Antigonus family to
lure the Secret Order into appearing, so as to obtain the Clown potion’s
formula.
The second possibility: the Clown potion’s formula is directly recorded in
the Antigonus family’s notebook… The fact that the Zaratul family is
seeking the relics of the Antigonus family implies that they share very deep
connections. They could’ve been allies or enemies. Hence, it seems fairly
natural that the Antigonus family possessed parts of their Sequence.
Things would be obvious if they were allies, but enemies are the ones who
would know each other the best…
But the second explanation wouldn’t be able to link it to the brand on the
suited clown. Sigh, I do wish that the second explanation were true
though. When the Holy Cathedral ﬁnds an expert to interpret the
notebook, I would be able to obtain the Clown potion without any risk.
It seems that the ﬁrst explanation is the most plausible. My gut feeling as a
Seer tells me that there might be a deeper symbolic meaning.
Having thought of this, Klein massaged his forehead and suddenly
realized the limitations of a Seer.
Unless it was a very simple and straightforward sign, a Seer had to be
extremely careful when making interpretations. It was just like
walking on the edge of the abyss or walking on a thin layer of ice
over a lake’s surface. The suited clown’s outcome was an actual and
bloody example of what a single mistake in interpretation or failure
to grasp a key point could result in!
In that instant, Klein had an illusion of himself mastering the true
essence of a Seer. He seemed to be just one step away from digesting
the potion completely.
“Thank you for enlightening me with your life… Praise the Lady!” he
muttered and drew a crimson moon before his chest.
Then he divined whether Azik had good intentions or if he was an
amazing Beyonder. He received conﬁrmations for both of them.
Eventually, the continuous divinations exhausted Klein. He had no
choice but to stop churning through his thoughts and decide on the
crucial matters that he needed to attend to.
I have to ﬁnd the man that appeared in the same scene with Welch,
Hanass Vincent, and the Antigonus family’s notebook as soon as possible!
I can begin my search with the Divination Club.
I can’t just confront Mr. Azik. Yes, he might be a Mid-Sequence Beyonder
of the Life School of Thought, but there’s a lack of information, making it
impossible for me to divine…
Phew. Klein let out a breath and conjured the portrait of the half-
century-old elder with messy eyebrows, thin brown hair, and gray-
blue eyes on the goatskin that appeared before him.
This was the third person present when the Antigonus family’s
notebook was traded between Welch and Hanass Vincent!
Looking at the portrait, Klein suddenly fell into a dilemma.
I can’t draw. During art class in primary school, I was always the one
receiving the greatest criticism from the teachers.
Should I use ritualistic magic like Old Neil? This was done by praying to
the Goddess… If I were to use the uniqueness of the area above the gray
fog… I would be in trouble if the divinities noticed something amiss!
Hold on a second, perhaps I can pray to myself! Transmitting images and
transmitting voices are similar… Although I’m temporarily unable to
access the mysterious power above the gray fog, accomplishing such a
minor matter shouldn’t be a problem!
Having thought of this, Klein immediately emanated his spirituality
to envelop himself to stimulate the feeling of falling.
Back in his bedroom, he lit the gas lamp and ‘prayed.’
“The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era;
“You are the mysterious ruler above the gray fog;
“You are the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck;
“I pray for your revelation and pray that you allow me to draw what
I’ve seen.”
After reciting the incantation, Klein didn’t splash essential oils or
burn any herbs to gain the help of their powers.
It was just that informal when praying to oneself!
There were suddenly murmurs in his ears as he saw the four black
dots that formed a square surface on the back of his hand.
He walked four steps counterclockwise and recited the incantation
before penetrating the maniacal chaos to return to the area above the
gray fog.
This time he didn’t see any of the crimson stars shrinking or
expanding. But behind the seat of honor at the long bronze table, the
strange symbol formed by a partial Pupil-less Eye and partial
contorted lines shimmered weakly as it produced illusory prayers.
Klein held his ear to it and listened. After making sure that there
were no mistakes, he conjured the portrait of the ‘third person’, and
cast it towards the ﬂowing light in accordance to the prayer’s format.
After everything was done, he immediately left the mysterious world
above the gray fog and returned to his bedroom.
Just as he found his footing, a portrait surfaced immediately in front
of Klein’s eyes. Furthermore, he sensed a weak and illusory power
augmenting him.
He picked up a fountain pen and found a piece of white paper and
expressed his intent.
Klein was surprised to ﬁnd his right hand moving uncontrollably as it
quickly drew lines.
Before long, he saw a lifelike portrait of the ‘third person’.
After writing down the hair and eye colors, as well as other unique
characteristics, Klein heaved a sigh of relief despite the spasms of his
right hand.
The illusion before his eyes rapidly dissipated.
Chapter 101: Unexpected Clue
Howes Street, Divination Club.
Klein pressed down on his half top hat and walked along the stairway
towards the main door.
He wasn’t dressed in his usual formal wear. Today, he was wearing a
white shirt and a light-colored vest, paired with a thin black
windbreaker, making him look more spirited than he had before.
This set of clothing was more suitable for combat and had only cost
him one pound, including the fee for the small pocket that he had
sewn into the vest. Compared to the suit he had purchased, it was so
cheap that it brought tears to his eyes.
He stroked the revolver in his holster, as well as the metal bottles in
his tiny inner pocket. Klein then took out the portrait and entered the
Divination Club.
Without any surprise, he met the beautiful attendant, Angelica.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Moretti. I thought you would come only a few
days later.” Angelica was taken aback at ﬁrst before she immediately
revealed a brilliant smile.
Klein took oﬀ his hat and sighed.
“Good afternoon, Miss Angelica. I had a dream at noon. I dreamed
about Mr. Hanass Vincent and matters regarding him. You know that,
as a fortune-teller, I absolutely cannot overlook any dream. It could
be a revelation from the divine.”
Confused by his charlatan-like words, Angelica nodded in thought
and asked out of curiosity, “What did you dream of?”
“I saw Hanass Vincent arguing with someone.” Klein passed her the
folded piece of paper in his hand.
As Angelica unfolded the portrait, he pinched his glabella and
observed the color of her emotions.
“This person…” Angelica looked at the realistic portrait and slipped
into deep thought.
Klein saw her emotions turn into a ‘thinking blue’, a normal reaction.
“This person…” Angelica muttered once again. She slowly looked up
and said, “I’ve met him before.”
Klein’s mind whirled as he immediately asked, “When was it?”
“I can’t remember the exact date. Maybe a month ago? I saw him
send Mr. Vincent to the door and they were softly discussing
something. I have a deep impression of him because of his thick and
messy eyebrows, as well as Mr. Vincent’s rare smile,” Angelica
described as she recalled. “Yes, he had a pair of grayish-blue eyes
and, like most men his age, had little hair on his head.”
“Did you meet him again before or after that?” asked Klein gently.
Angelica shook her head.
“No, I am certain of that. I don’t even know his name. To be honest,
if it wasn’t you, I would have suspected that any person showing me
a portrait like this is a policeman investigating Mr. Vincent’s death.
Heh, I don’t ﬁnd it odd no matter what revelation you receive, for
you are a true Seer.”
My apologies, I am a policeman… Klein retorted silently as he sighed
and said, “A true Seer would understand how minuscule he truly is
compared to the vastness of fate. We can only see a hazy corner,
forever receiving revelations, but never answers. We must reﬂect
upon them constantly and keep up our respect and fear. We must
decipher these hints with caution and not see ourselves as the
intelligent ones who have taken control of fate.”
By summarizing what he had ﬁgured out over the past few weeks,
Klein suddenly realized that his Spirit Vision turned clearer. He could
even faintly make out the details within Angelica’s aura.
At that instant, he felt like a shortsighted man who was wearing
glasses that suited him.
This… has my Seer potion begun to produce clear signs of digestion?
Klein was stunned in disbelief.
“I never imagined that a Seer like you can still maintain such fear
and respect towards fate. It’s truly admirable,” said Angelica
earnestly.
She had seen too many people in the Divination Club who claimed to
see through the truth and change fate after learning a few divination
methods.
Klein retracted his gaze and chuckled.
“The more you know, the better you can understand how small we
truly are.”
As he was saying this, he checked his body’s condition and reﬂected
on his past experiences. He could basically narrow the essence of the
‘acting’ technique to ‘actions corresponding to the name of the
potion, understanding the hidden laws governing the role, as well as
strictly abiding by these laws’.
Only by doing so could he change the state of his body, heart, and
soul, making them closer to the remnant psyche in the potion, so as
to gradually digest it.
The acknowledgment of a Seer’s identity was only a factor on the
surface. The reason why it made one’s spirituality feel light had to do
with how the feedback strengthened one’s aﬃrmation of particular
divination actions. And these actions collectively formed the rules for
digesting the Seer potion.
To help others interpret revelations and guide them in a better
direction; yet constantly maintain one’s fear and respect towards fate.
One cannot be too egoistical, too proud, or blindly believe one’s
interpretations… These are the laws I can think of for the time being,
as well as the essence of the ‘acting’ technique that will guide me
towards the future. If it continues to be this successful, I won’t need
half a year. Perhaps in two or three months, or even two to three
weeks time, I’ll be ready to completely digest the potion.
… That sign was extremely obvious. It’s no wonder the mysterious Mr.
Zaratul said that the Beyonder will clearly sense it when the potion is fully
digested. There’s no need for anyone to teach them. It is what it is… Just
like now, although my Spirit Vision has been enhanced a little, I know
very well that this is only a pit stop in the digestion process and not the
ﬁnal destination.
With this in mind, Klein couldn’t help but thank the suited clown for
teaching him with his life!
If it wasn’t for him, he would probably spend months at the
Divination Club, summarizing the rules of a Seer through numerous
attempts—for better or for worse—before he began ‘acting’ strictly.
“Mr. Moretti, I sometimes even think of you as a philosopher,”
Angelica said with a sigh upon hearing Klein’s reply.
“In my circle of friends, the term ‘philosopher’ is used to scold
somebody.” Klein was in a good mood.
With that said, he bowed, wore his hat, and left after bidding
farewell.
Although Angelica was unaware of the gentleman’s name or identity,
Klein was in no way depressed. What he learned was suﬃcient
enough for him to engage in the next phase of his plan.
…
36 Zouteland Street. Inside Blackthorn Security Company.
Dunn looked at the portrait in his hands with his deep gray eyes.
“You wish to carry out a search for this person?”
“Yes.” Klein had long prepared a reason for this. “Captain, didn’t I
mention that I would head to the Divination Club to observe the
reactions of its members on Hanass Vincent’s sudden death? I didn’t
discover anything yesterday, but I accidentally found out today that
the person in the portrait had appeared with Hanass Vincent once
and was secretly discussing something with him. I ﬂipped through
our team’s investigation report just now, but I didn’t discover any
person resembling him in the report.”
There were no loopholes in his description. Even if Dunn Smith were
to take this portrait to the Divination Club, he would get the same
answer from Angelica.
Dunn cast his gaze away from the portrait and laughed.
“From the looks of it, the compensation funds weren’t a waste.”
… Captain, isn’t your memory bad? Why would you mention the
compensation at this point in time… Klein maintained a smile and
didn’t say a word.
“Was this drawn by you?” Dunn asked in passing.
“Yes. I drew it with the help of ritualistic magic,” Klein replied,
completely honest.
Of course, speaking the truth and revealing the whole truth were two
diﬀerent matters.
Dunn nodded slightly and said, “Get Old Neil to make a few more
sets. I’ll get Kenley and Royale to investigate and seek the
cooperation of the police department. If this clue is of any use, you
would’ve contributed greatly once again.”
“May Goddess bless us.” Klein tapped four spots on his chest as he
appeared abnormally devout.
For him, all he needed from Dunn and company was to ﬁgure out the
name and identity of the man in the portrait. He could divine his
location above the gray fog!
…
Despite it being his day oﬀ, Klein didn’t immediately return home
after leaving the Blackthorn Security Company. Instead, he took the
public carriage to the harbor and arrived in front of the Evil Dragon
Bar’s entrance.
In his considerations, although a Seer lacked the means to directly
engage in combat with an enemy or the means to cast spells quickly,
combat could be classiﬁed in many ways. Not all battles were chance
encounters. As long as he had suﬃcient time to prepare, a Seer could
similarly deal with an enemy using ritualistic magic. It was exactly
how he resolved the magic mirror divination incident at Selena’s
house.
And this also meant that it was best if a Seer brought along the
essential oils, herbs, and tiny candles to avoid being in a situation
where they were unavailable when they were needed most, thus,
resulting in a helpless death. After all, not everyone was like Selena
who had an entire assortment of mysticism items which could be
used.
As for the ones he applied for, as Klein had practiced frequently, he
had used up most of them. He kept what was left in his tiny inner
pocket.
He patted the cash note in his pocket and pushed open Evil Dragon
Bar’s door and strode in.
It was noon and there weren’t many customers in the bar. Nor were
there any rat-baiting or boxing matches. It was quiet and not lively
enough.
Klein observed the guests drinking beer and playing cards as he
walked toward the billiard room that led to the underground market.
At that moment, he saw a muscular old man walk out with a torn
Admiral’s jacket draped over his shoulders.
“Were you the friend Old Neil brought last time?” Reeking with the
smell of alcohol, the blue-eyed, messy brown-haired elder sized up
Klein and laughed.
Klein guessed at his identity and took oﬀ his hat and bowed.
“Yes, how might I address you?”
“Old Neil often mentions you. I’m the boss here, Swain.” The blue-
eyed elder’s arms were thick and brawny. He had ﬁrm muscles and
had the bearing of a military oﬃcer.
Former Tingen Mandated Punisher Captain… Rumor has it that he was
once part of the Royal Navy… Klein replied politely, “Yes.”
“If you’re in need of money, feel free to approach me.” Swain
laughed as he mentioned before walking towards the bar counter.
At that moment, Klein’s heart stirred as he immediately shouted,
“Wait a moment, Mr. Swain. I have something I would like to ask of
you.”
Swain halted in his steps, turned halfway around, and said with a
chuckle, “You look, well—very similar.”
No, I’m not having memory issues… The corner of Klein’s lips twitched
as he pointed at the portrait he drew and asked, “Have you met this
gentleman before?”
He suddenly realized that Selena had likely been brought by Hanass
Vincent to the underground market. This resulted in Elizabeth’s
knowledge of the Evil Dragon Bar as well. Then, could the man in the
portrait who had some relationship with Hanass Vincent have come
here before?
Swain took a careful look and replied aﬃrmatively, “I remember him.
He had asked me if I had documents or items related to the main
peak of the Hornacis mountain range.”
Documents and items related to the main peak of the Hornacis mountain
range?Klein was taken aback as he suddenly connected that to
another matter.
Back when he was borrowing the journal issue related to the main
peak of the Hornacis mountain range at Deweyville Library, the
librarian had casually mentioned that someone had just returned it.
Therefore, he still remembered very cleverly and didn’t need to ﬂip
through his name cards to determine if the man existed.
Could the gentleman who borrowed the journal issue before me be the one
in the portrait?
The gentleman that had witnessed the exchange of the Antigonus
family’s notebook.
Chapter 102: Cloth Merchant
The more Klein thought about it, the more likely it seemed.
Otherwise, who would have borrowed those random journal issues
for no reason?
Yes, research regarding the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range is
quite an unpopular ﬁeld. Other than the corresponding lecturers and
associate professors, the common hobbyist would’ve never heard of it.
Even the original Klein, who was a history graduate, only knew about it
from the Antigonus family’s notebook… Although Tingen is a city of
universities, there wouldn’t be that many people who would interested in
the topic. And even if there is anyone interested, most of them would
remain within the university’s compounds. There would be no need to
borrow the book from the Deweyville Library.
The most important point is that the book happened to be borrowed only
recently…
By analyzing it this way, there really is a problem. I wasn’t sharp enough
and failed to realize it… Sigh, it looks like I have no talent at being a
detective or acting like Sherlock Holmes…
While these thoughts raced through his mind, the boss of Evil Dragon
Bar, Swain asked in puzzlement, “Is there a problem?”
Since there were customers and bartenders around, he could only ask
indirectly.
“Nothing at all. I’m just wondering how I can investigate this
gentleman. As you know, Hanass Vincent died at his home.” Klein
had long prepared his excuse.
He didn’t want to make the Mandated Punishers become interested in
the ancient relics from the main peak of the Hornacis mountain
range.
“Vincent was one of the rather famous fortune-tellers in Tingen City.
He often came here.” Swain had indeed given a perfunctory answer,
but as he recalled, he said, “Now that I think about it, the gentleman
in the portrait did come together with Vincent at the very
beginning…”
“That is exactly what I wanted to know. Do you remember his
name?” Klein pressed immediately.
Swain shook his head and chuckled.
“I won’t ask for my customers’ names or identities unless I knew
them to begin with, like Old Neil.”
“Alright then.” Klein deliberately revealed a saddened look.
To him, it didn’t matter if Swain knew, because he could check the
Deweyville Library.
To borrow books from a privately-funded library, he had to leave
personal information, and his identiﬁcation must have had suﬃcient
credibility!
After all, Klein had relied on an introduction letter from a Senior
Associate Professor before he obtained a library card.
Even if the gentleman had forged his information, it is very likely that he
left some clues which can be helpful to my divination… Klein watched
Swain as he returned to the bar counter before entering the billiard
room in deep thought.
He wasn’t in a hurry to head to the Deweyville Library for his
investigations. He planned on completing his purchases ﬁrst. After
all, it was unknown if he would encounter danger and be required to
use ritualistic magic for subsequent developments.
After passing through a few rooms, Klein arrived at the underground
market. There were a few stalls and customers, a clear indication that
it wasn’t peak hour yet.
Just as he took a step forward, he suddenly saw the monster,
Ademisaul, who could smell the scent of death, standing in a corner.
The young man was pale, and his eyes gave oﬀ a hint of terror and
madness. He had also noticed Klein as he looked over.
As they made eye contact, Ademisaul suddenly extended his hands to
cover his face. He moved toward the corner of the wall in a panicked
state.
Soon, he moved to a side door beside him and staggered as he ran
out.
Is that necessary? I just nearly blinded you the last time… But I didn’t do
anything… Seriously, it’s as if I’m the devil. Klein’s facial expression was
somewhat stiﬀ.
He shook his head and smiled. He stopped thinking about the
monster and came to a stall. He started shopping with a goal in mind.
After about half an hour, Klein spent a few pounds which was most of
his secret stash of money.
He counted the three pounds and seventeen soli he had left, and he
felt his heart ache. However, he touched the small metal bottle in the
inner pocket of his black windbreaker.
“This is the ﬂoral essence, Amantha, which Madam Daly used
previously.
“This is powder mixed with drago tree bark and leaves.
“Essential oil which is extracted from slumber ﬂowers.
“Dried chamomile petals.
“This is Holy Night Powder which I previously produced myself.”
…
Klein recalled the items stored in every tiny pocket of his and
repeated them. He did it to prevent himself from failing to ﬁnd the
ingredient that he would need at a crucial moment.
Relying on his unique traits in mysticism, he quickly ﬁnished
memorizing them and walked toward the door.
Suddenly, he saw a somewhat familiar ﬁgure in the corner of his
eyes.
It was a young lady in a casual green dress. Her smooth black hair
was soft and glistening. She had a round face with long eyes. They
gave her a sweet look and a reﬁned bearing.
It’s the girl who was shivering strangely on the public carriage? She does
seem ﬁne… I never expected her to be a mysticism enthusiast… Klein
slowed down and thought for a few seconds before ﬁnally recalling
who she was.
He had to admit that, other than Justice who he had never seen
clearly, the young lady was the most beautiful girl he had seen ever
since he transmigrated into this world.
The sweet and reﬁned girl stood before a stall that sold mysticism
books and, in a breach of etiquette, kneeled to rub her ﬁngers against
an ancient book.
The ancient book was bound with a black hardcover. The book cover
had the words “Book of Witches” in Hermes.
“It records the black magic of witches. Although I haven’t dared to
try them, someone I know did, and it really worked.” The vendor
seized the opportunity to promote the book.
The beautiful lady thought and asked, “In your mind, what does a
witch look like?”
“A witch? A wicked person who brings calamities, disease, and pain,”
the vendor answered after some thought.
Klein didn’t hear their conversation because he had already quickly
walked out the front entrance. He was rushing to the Deweyville
Library in a hurry to settle everything before returning home to cook
dinner for his brother and sister. Tomato Oxtail Soup was on the
menu.
…
Backlund. Crown Turf Club.
Audrey Hall wore a long white dress with engageantes and ruﬄed
edges, as well as lace around her chest. She stood in a VIP room and
watched the horses gallop.
She wore a veiled hat decorated with blue ribbons and silk ﬂowers,
and a pair of light colored ﬁshnet gloves. Her cold and distant gaze
seemed out of place in the bustling venue.
Just as the racehorse breasted the tape, her friend Viscount Glaint
came closer and said with a suppressed voice, “Audrey, every time I
see you, you look beautiful from a diﬀerent angle.”
“How can I help you?” In the past, Audrey might have basked in the
young man’s compliment, but now she could see Glaint’s ulterior
motives through his speech and attitude.
Due to the early passing of Glaint’s father, he had inherited his title
of nobility at the age of twenty. He was a slightly skinny young man.
He looked to the left and right, then chuckled softly as he said,
“Audrey, I know a real Beyonder, a Beyonder that doesn’t belong to
the royal family.”
You’ve disappointed me every time you said that… Audrey looked
forward and replied elegantly, “Really?”
“I swear on my father’s name. I have seen his Beyonder powers,”
Glaint replied with whisper.
Audrey was no longer the same as before in which should be excited
over the news. She was now a Beyonder, but to prevent Glaint from
turning suspicious, she widened her eyes and faked a surprised smile.
She asked with her voice trembling, “When can I see him?”
Yes, it’d be great to meet other Beyonders. I can’t just solve every triviality
through the Tarot Club… Besides, I must gather my own resources to
exchange them with Mr. Fool and Mr. Hanged Man… Not everything can
be solved with money… Sigh, now that I’ve sent out the thousand pounds,
I’ll have to be more frugal…
Glaint was very satisﬁed with Audrey’s response. He looked towards
the racecourse and said, “Tomorrow afternoon, there will be a
literature and music salon at my place.”
…
Inside Deweyville Library.
Klein took out his identity card and badge from his pocket and
showed them to the few librarians.
“I am a probationary inspector from the Special Operations
Department of the Awwa County Police. I need your cooperation in
an investigation,” he said in a deep voice, recalling the police ﬁlms
that he used to watch.
The librarians looked at the identity card and badge before
exchanging looks and nodding at each other.
“Go ahead and ask, Oﬃcer.”
Klein recited the names of the journals like New Archeology and
upon ﬁnishing, he said, “I want the borrowing records of the journal
for the last two months.”
He realized that one of the librarians had attended to him before, but
it was obvious that the man didn’t recognize him.
“Alright. Hold on a second.” The librarians started searching and
quickly found the recent borrowing records.
Klein ﬂipped through the records seriously, looking for the man who
had borrowed the same journal as he did.
There weren’t many names since there was only one. He had
borrowed the journal several times, including the issue that Klein
knew of. The earliest entry was at the end of May, and the most
recent one was last Saturday, a day before Hanass Vincent’s death.
Klein ran his ﬁnger over the borrower’s information and memorized
it.
Sirius Arapis, cloth merchant, residing at 19 Howes Street…
Chapter 103: Doing As the Heart
Willed
He resides at 19 Howes Street?
Whilst memorizing the information, Klein keenly noticed a piece of
information.
Yes, Welch stayed on Howes Street. The Divination Club is on Howes
Street. This cloth merchant named Sirius Arapis also lives on Howes
Street… From the looks of it, it’s nothing strange for Welch to know
Hanass Vincent either. They might have even gotten to know each through
Sirius Arapis…
Suddenly, Klein felt that he had linked the clues together as his
thoughts turned clear.
He was originally confused as to how Welch would be acquainted
with Hanass Vincent since this son of a banker wasn’t particularly
interested in mysticism. To him, money was more important than
divinations. But now, Klein felt that he had an inkling as to how they
became acquainted.
According to the descriptions of several magazines, middle-class and
wealthy residents would gladly pay a visit to their neighbors from the
same social class in order to form a social circle which is beneﬁcial to
them. Similarly, Welch and the cloth merchant, Sirius, absolutely have the
motivation and opportunity to become friends since they both lived in the
Howes Street vicinity…
It isn’t hard to understand how Sirius knew Hanass Vincent, who regularly
went to the Divination Club on Howes Street. Perhaps it was a
coincidental meeting, or perhaps Hanass had helped him out before.
Regardless, this made it possible for the two of them, who frequently ran
into each other within the same area, to become closer to one another….
Hanass Vincent wanted to sell his ancient books, and thus, Sirius
introduced him to Welch, who was an undergraduate of the History
department…
In Hanass’ dream, there was the ﬁgure of the suspected evil god, the “True
Creator.” He also knew of the proper incantation format. This proves that
he was very deep into the realm of mysticism. The possibility that he might
have even been a member of some secret organization cannot be
dismissed.
I cannot rule out the possibility of him joining some secret organization
under Sirius’s inﬂuence.
…
With ideas coming to him so easily, Klein could tell that the
information the man had left behind had a certain level of credibility
without even using divination methods.
Even if he isn’t called Sirius Arapis, nor work as a cloth merchant, and
doesn’t live at 19 Howes Street, he deﬁnitely resides at Howes Street or, at
the very least, somewhere nearby!
While these ideas ran through his mind, Klein viewed the borrowing
records once again with this new train of thought.
The last time he came to Deweyville Library was last Saturday, a day
before Selena’s birthday party, which was also a day before Hanass
Vincent died. Several days have already passed since then, but he hasn’t
returned the issues that he borrowed.
According to past records, if he only borrowed two issues, he would
usually return them the next day.
Could this mean that he knows of Hanass’ death and was scared to the
point that he no longer dares to come to the Deweyville Library again?
Yes, he started by borrowing several unrelated history books and journals
until he narrowed down what he needed, which is very similar to what I
had read…
This means that there was no one teaching him. There was no Senior
Associate Professor from the history department of a university. He did
this completely through trial and error.
What would a shocked target do? Two choices. One, if he had all the
necessary information, he would head straight to the main peak of the
Hornacis mountain range. Two, if he still lacks information, he would lay
low and observe the situation. He would only show himself again if he’s
certain that Hanass’ death wouldn’t implicate him.
Having made this conclusion, Klein closed the borrowing records and
returned them to the librarians. He then took out the portrait and
asked if anyone had seen the man. Unfortunately, many people came
to borrow books every day, and the librarians didn’t have any
impression of the average person.
“Alright, thank you for your time.” Klein put away his identiﬁcation
documents and his badge.
He had no intention of continuing the investigation alone. This
wasn’t only dangerous, but also troublesome. He planned to head to
Zouteland Street once again and hand the case over to Captain and
his teammates. He then planned to go home and prepare his Tomato
Oxtail Soup for his siblings before heading to the world above the
gray fog to divine the target’s whereabouts and condition.
“Oﬃcer, is there anything else?” a librarian asked sincerely as he
heaved a sigh of relief.
Klein nodded slightly and asked, “No, I will come back if there are
new clues.”
He held his black cane with his left hand and made his way to the
door.
At this moment, he saw a man enter the library with his head hung
low. He was dressed in a double-breasted coat, its collars standing
tall.
When they walked past each other, Klein caught a glance of his thick,
messy brows, and his pair of grayish-blue eyes!
These were things the tall collar couldn’t hide!
Sirius? Sirius Arapis? A coincidence? Klein froze. He didn’t expect to meet
his target here!
What kind of luck was this!
Wasn’t this too much of a coincidence?
He evaluated his physical condition and felt his aching sore muscles.
Thus, he acted as though nothing had happened and continued
walking towards the door.
Well, we have to follow what our heart tells us! Safety matters!
It doesn’t matter if I missed this opportunity as long as Sirius is still in
Tingen!
At this moment, the man in the double-breasted coat arrived before
the counter and was handing the journals to one of the librarians.
“It’s a return,” he said with a soft, muﬄed tone.
The librarian received the journals causally and when he saw it, he
suddenly froze.
He subconsciously looked up and diﬀerently as his body couldn’t help
but tremble.
“Is there a problem?” the man asked in a deep voice.
His question seemed like a spark that ignited a fuse, causing the
librarian to instantly lose his self-control. He sprinted to the side and
shouted,
“Oﬃcer!”
“The criminal is here!”
At this moment, Klein, who hadn’t left the building, cursed madly in
his heart.
He instinctively reached for his holster with his right hand and drew
his revolver.
That man froze for a moment before turning and breaking into a
sprint.
But he didn’t head for the door. Instead, he escaped in the direction
of the oriel window to the side, as if he wanted to smash through the
glass and jump out onto the street.
Klein, who was ﬂustered, turned his head to see the scene when he
felt a sudden calm.
He realized that even though he was afraid of the target, his target
was more afraid of him!
The man must be unable to determine my abilities in such an abrupt
meeting. He isn’t clear on what I am adept in, and so, he will instinctively
avoid a direct confrontation and look for other ways to escape! Conﬁdent
of his analysis, Klein lifted his revolver and pulled the trigger.
At that moment, the man in the double-breasted coat abruptly rolled
onto the ground in an attempt to avoid the bullet.
Following up on that, he pressed down on the ground with his right
hand and propelled himself into the air towards the oriel window.
Click! Klein’s ﬁrst shot was empty.
But this was something he had expected. He took advantage of
Sirius’s inability to dodge while in midair to aim at his torso and
pulled the trigger.
Bang!
The silver demon hunting bullets tore through the air and penetrated
straight through Sirius’s back.
Crash! The glass shattered and Sirius ﬂew out the window, leaving
drops of crimson blood on the crystalline glass fragments and
windowsill.
Klein was no longer afraid now that the target was injured. He ran
over and jumped out the window with the help of a chair.
This was the area lining the back of Deweyville Library’s ground
ﬂoor. A row of trees isolated a lush green ﬁeld.
The injured Sirius was running to the side, in an attempt to enter a
small alley between two buildings. Having not practiced shooting at
moving targets, Klein didn’t dare to ﬁre blindly. He could only carry
his cane in one hand and his gun in the other as he pursued the man
in a black coat.
Tap! Tap! Tap!
He followed the trail of blood on the ﬂoor and tried to close the
distance.
With a corner coming up, the injured Sirius’s speed became slower
and slower. Klein, who had been waiting for an opportunity to
capture him, suddenly felt a little afraid. He felt as though the man in
front of him wasn’t human, but a wolf or a tiger, one that harbored
terrifying dangers.
This was an instinct he had as a Seer, and also a warning given to
him by his spirituality!
Klein immediately slowed down, his eyes scanning the blood on the
ground.
Compared to the blood he had seen earlier, Sirius’s blood was now
black!
At this moment, a violent wind overwhelmed him. Sirius’s face was
reﬂected in Klein’s eyes.
Thick, messy brows. Grayish blue eyes. Multiple protruding warts. An
open mouth with two rows of white teeth.
Sirius was launching a counterattack at this moment!
This made the face reﬂected in Klein’s eyes more visible. He could
even smell a particularly putrid stench!
Sirius pounced a distance of seven or eight meters, far more than any
normal human being could jump. But as Klein had stopped chasing
him just in time, there was still a distance of nearly ten meters
between them.
When the distance was shortened to two meters, the sticky saliva
caused by drool and the disgusting dense warts formed a harrowing
scene that made Klein’s nerves tense up.
Without thinking, he seized the opportunity of the temporary
immobility caused by Sirius’s pounce to raise his right hand. He ﬁred
without stopping, allowing the bullets to rain down on the target’s
head.
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Shooting from such a close distance allowed the silver demon hunting
bullets to drill through Sirius’s head. Blood splattered everywhere as
his face became more and more mangled, until he staggered
backwards.
Klein had emptied the bullets in his revolver in an instant. He
subconsciously wanted to take a few steps back in order to conﬁrm
the results of this battle.
But at this moment, Sirius gave Klein the shock of his life by trying
his hardest to stand up straight. Klein abruptly lifted the cane in his
left hand.
Smack! The sturdy silver-inlaid black cane struck Sirius’s neck,
leaving a dark red mark.
Smack! Smack! Smack!
Klein acted on instinct, raining blows on his opponent until Sirius
collapsed stumbling onto the ground.
Huﬀ! Puﬀ! Huﬀ! Klein supported himself with his cane and took deep
breaths. His eyes were trained intently on his target, afraid that Sirius
would suddenly jump back to life.
At that moment, Sirius’ head had basically been smashed into a pulp,
and the warts gradually receded. His body stopped moving after a
few convulsions.
Klein was in no hurry to examine the corpse. Instead, he tossed his
cane to the side and took out the demon hunting bullets he had on
him and reloaded his revolver.
After doing this, he collected himself and fought back his disgust,
kneeling down to search the pockets of Sirius’s double-breasted coat.
Chapter 104: Mr. Z
One pocket, two pockets, three pockets… Klein soon found a
bloodstained wallet, a Deweyville Library card, two pairs of brass
keys, an unstuﬀed smoking pipe, a sheathed dagger, and a few letters
that were folded neatly.
Laying everything onto the ground except for the letters, he stood up
straight and looked at the wallet. He conﬁrmed that there were only
ten plus soli and some copper pennies.
The craftsmanship of the wallet is quite exquisite. It’s such a pity…
Klein sighed, feeling a little distracted.
If I didn’t spend so much of my private stash of money, buying a
wallet would’ve been on my schedule today.
After shaking his head, Klein opened the letters and quickly scanned
through them.
“Dear Mr. Z,”
“Please allow me to defend myself. When Hanass and I sold oﬀ the
Antigonus family’s notebook, it wasn’t stupidity or betrayal. It didn’t
appear special in any way when it was in our hands.”
“I suspect that it’s alive and that it’s a wicked item armed with a
certain life and wisdom. It was something dangerous that needed to
be sealed.”
“At diﬀerent stages and before diﬀerent people, it shows diﬀerent
contents!”
“This is a proven fact that I’ve learnt from the lamb in the police
station.”
“Although the notebook shows content that is suﬃciently true each
time with plenty of evidence, I believe that it would only reveal the
completed content in the hands of a descendant of the Antigonus
family.”
“When Hanass and I received it, we could only see some trivial
matters of the Antigonus family, the general situation of the Nation
of the Evernight on the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range,
and also the three Sequence potion formulas we handed in to you
previously.”
“As you know, the Secret Order has the Seer pathway in its grasp and
possesses powerful tracking abilities, so Hanass and I believed that it
would be a risky move to continue keeping the notebook. The value
it had presented to us wasn’t suﬃcient for us to take the risk.”
“Since we couldn’t wait for your reply, we agreed amongst ourselves
to sell the notebook to Welch, who was living on the same street . He
enjoyed collecting relics and ancient books, and he could aﬀord to
pay a high price for it. As for the subsequent developments, you are
already aware of it.”
“This is the ﬁrst thing that I’d like to explain. As I am writing these
words, Hanass is dead. He died due to a heart attack during his sleep.
That must be a blessing from God, to prevent him from suﬀering the
outcome of falling into the hands of heretics.”
“I had no choice but to move to somewhere safer, more hidden. I
didn’t even dare to leave the house. Luckily, the lamb told me that
the reason Hanass was being eyed by the heretics wasn’t because of
the Antigonus family’s notebook, nor was his identity exposed. It was
just that he had taken in a silly female disciple in the hopes of slowly
developing her into one of us.”
“His female disciple had stolen a glance at his secret incantation and
tried the magic divination while a Nighthawk heretic was watching. I
believe you can pretty much guess the rest of the story, so there is no
need for me to describe it.”
“It’s a pity that the position of the lamb isn’t high enough, so the
actual details cannot be determined.”
“From various feedback, it seems the heretics have yet to suspect me.
Their investigations came to a halt due to Hanass’ sudden death.”
“Therefore, I will return to the streets and plan to borrow a few more
journal issues from the Deweyville Library to seek out more clues.”
“As a faction that also had the Seer pathway in its grasp, the
Antigonus family must have had some divinations regarding its
decimation. They must have left behind secret treasures that would
allow for the revival of the family!”
“There’s suﬃcient reason to believe that the treasure is hidden on the
main peak of the Hornacis mountain range, which is in one of the
relics in the Nation of the Evernight!”
Having read that, Klein’s pupils constricted rapidly. He nearly
dropped the letter.
The pathway that the Antigonus family had in its grasp was the Seer
pathway?
What a coincidence!
…
Thunder seemed to boom in Klein’s head again and again that left
him in a daze. He felt as though it was destiny.
The notebook that led to the original Klein’s death and indirectly
helped me transmigrate, originated from the Antigonus family that
has the Seer pathway in its grasp. The one that eventually made me
choose the Seer potion was the Emperor Roselle’s diary, while
Emperor Roselle was biased towards the Seer Sequence because of
the mysterious Mr. Zaratul who was the leader of the Secret Order,
which also has the Seer pathway in its grasp!
… This is like a suﬀocating net sewn by Fate.
What exactly is lurking behind all of this?
Klein held the letter and paced back and forth. He needed to verify
the contents with other sources.
Yes, the Secret Order that the Zaratul family controls is pursuing and
searching for the belongings left behind by the Antigonus family. If
both parties shared the same Beyonder Sequence, there would be a
suﬃcient reason and motive. Perhaps, it is to bridge any missing
Sequences, obtain rare ingredients for a higher Sequence
advancement, or covet the other party’s accumulated experiences in
avoiding the loss of control…
Going by this line of thought, it is rather reasonable that the
Antigonus family has at least part of the Seer Sequence chain.
Yes, when I was divining for clues pertaining to the Clown potion,
the images that emerged were mostly related to the Antigonus family.
The only exception was the suited clown from the Secret Order…
Therefore, the true meaning behind the symbolism is that each scene
carries the possibility of obtaining the Clown potion and a clue.
However, I didn’t understand the crux of the issue and regrettably
missed it.
With the two corroborating evidence, Klein nearly believed the
matters that Sirius had brought up in the letter. He also understood
why he constantly heard the word ‘Hornacis’ in the murmurs he
shouldn’t be hearing.
The earliest occurrence of this happening was when I ﬁrst consumed
the Seer potion!
He wore a serious expression as he thought to himself.
Meanwhile, he guessed that ‘being a survivor of those that made
contact with a relic of the Antigonus family’ and ‘becoming a
Beyonder of the Seer pathway’ were two necessary conditions to hear
the murmurs saying ‘Hornacis.’
Is there really a secret treasure buried within the ancient ruins on the
main peak of the Hornacis mountain range by the Antigonus family?
No, I can’t think about this! Just the notebook alone has killed so
many people. Any complete treasure would be even more terrifying!
Klein shook his head subconsciously and cast his gaze onto the third
piece of paper, which was the last of the letters.
“Honorable Mr. Z, I hope I can gain your assistance. I believe that
you should be suﬃciently interested in the treasure too.”
“Until then, I will make myself look like a normal person, a normal
lover of history.”
“When the end of days arrives, I will oﬀer all of Tingen’s lambs as a
sacriﬁce to God.”
“Humbly, Sirius Arapis.”
When he ﬁnished reading Sirius’s letter, Klein had the urge to laugh.
Heh, why do I feel like I saved Tingen? What was this guy trying to
do? Heretics are truly unbelievable…
Who is this Mr. Z? He seems like someone in a high position… At the
very least, he should be at the same sequence as Captain.
Where was Sirius sending the letter to? He didn’t write down the
address… It seems like that’s the cautiousness of a heretic. They
wouldn’t put the address on until the moment before they sent it
out…
Right, if the Antigonus family had the potion of the Seer pathway in
its grasp, then would the Clown potion be among the three formulas
inside the Antigonus family’s notebook that Sirius sent?”
Highly likely!
In that instant, Klein seemed to have found clues to the Clown
potion.
Although Sirius didn’t bring the formula along with him, it was
possible that he had left some form of record at his hideout. He must
have also had it in his head, in his memories!
Klein looked at the corpse before him and considered the problem of
making a dead person speak.
It required almost zero consideration, as an idea immediately popped
into his head.
“Mediumship!”
Spirit Mediums could directly communicate with spirits that had yet
to disperse. Seers, Mystery Pryers, and others could roughly
accomplish the same thing using ritualistic magic.
Previously, when he was dealing with the corpse of the suited clown,
there were three things that had kept Klein from using mediumship.
Firstly, he was in a hurry to save the rest. Secondly, he didn’t have
the ingredients with him, and lastly, he lacked conﬁdence. Thus, he
didn’t consider the option of mediumship and missed his best chance.
When they returned to Blackthorn Security Company, the spirit was
mostly gone. Even a Spirit Medium could only get superﬁcial
information.
But now, Klein happened to have all the ingredients and tools, and he
happened to have the experience of communicating with lingering
resentment through the help of dream divination.
My only concern about contacting the spirit of a heretic would be
being placed in the same situation as Captain’s entry into Hanass’
dream where he saw a horrifying existence… However, Captain only
remained frail for two days, and he wasn’t considered severely
injured. Yes, I could give it a try! He hesitated for less than twenty
seconds before making a decision. He didn’t want to miss out on this
opportunity.
He raised his head, turned around, and cast his gaze toward the spot
where the window had shattered. There was a crowd gathered there
watching.
He took out his identiﬁcation card and badge before returning to the
broken window. He then told the onlookers through the shattered
oriel window,
“I am a probationary inspector from the Special Operations
Department of the Awwa County Police. I have shot the criminal to
death. Please take this badge to the nearest police station and tell
them to send backup to deal with the follow-up.”
“The rest are to help me cordon oﬀ this area. Do not allow anyone to
come close for they might contaminate the scene.”
“Yes, Oﬃcer!” The librarian that caused Klein the trouble quickly
took the badge.
When the entire scene was cordoned oﬀ and no one could enter the
grass patch, Klein returned to the corner and stood by the side of the
corpse.
He was glad that the innocent crowd couldn’t see the dead body,
which looked more like a monster than a human. He put down his
cane and revolver, then reached into the inner pocket of his
windbreaker to take out a metal bottle.
He was going to use the techniques of a mediumship ritual with
dream divination to make the dead man speak!
Chapter 105: Spirit Channeling
Klein twisted open the golden bottle’s cap and brought it to his nose.
He took a whiﬀ of the stimulating scent that energized him.
This was Holy Night Powder made using Slumber ﬂowers, Dragon
Blood grass, deep red sandalwood, mint, and other herbs. Since it
was simple to concoct, Klein had made a batch the moment he got
the ingredients from the underground market. It was going to be of
use now.
He poured a little of the Holy Night Powder on his palm and
collected himself. His irises turned dark.
Next, Klein put away the metal bottle and scattered the powder onto
the ground after infusing his spirituality into it.
He scattered the powder as he walked, forming a circle around
Sirius’s corpse.
A formless barrier rose, separating them from the outside world.
Klein ﬂicked away the remaining Holy Night Powder on his hand and
took out the other metal bottles. He sprinkled the Amantha pure dew
and other liquids in the surrounding area.
The ritual he set up was diﬀerent from the one Old Neil used at Ray
Bieber’s house since the aim of the ritual was diﬀerent.
For example, Old Neil poured the liquids before using the Holy Night
Powder. That could create a serene and holy state second only to an
actual altar. Klein had used the Holy Night Powder ﬁrst before
pouring the liquids to prevent Sirius’s remnant spirituality from being
disturbed by the surrounding objects while still barely managing to
have an environment that satisﬁed the requirements of the ritual.
If he had used Old Neil’s method, the rest of Sirius’s spirituality
would’ve been purged, making it impossible to establish a
connection.
After ﬁnishing his preparations, Klein put away the materials and
entered a state of Cogitation. He recited the Hermes incantations
softly, “I pray for the power of the dark night.
“I pray for the power of the mystery.
“I pray for the Goddess’ loving grace.
“I pray that you’ll allow me to communicate with the heretic’s
spirituality inside this altar.”
…
As the incantations reverberated throughout the sealed space, Klein
suddenly felt a massive, terrifying, and mysterious energy descend
upon him.
His eyes turned completely black as though he had lost his pupils and
the whites of his eyes.
Seizing the opportunity, Klein recited a divination statement in his
heart, “The formula to the Clown potion.
“The formula to the Clown potion.”
…
As he was reciting the statement, he used Cogitation to temporarily
enter a dreamlike state.
It was a hazy gray world without a sky or ground. Klein was
unusually alert as he observed a transparent, ethereal ﬁgure.
He extended his right hand and touched the remnants of Sirius’s
spirit.
The scene in front of him changed with a rumble.
It was a study table painted with dark red paint. There were three
candles on a silver candle stand, as well as a blank piece of paper.
Sirius had a pen in his hand. He wrote in Loen language, “This is the
second formula, its name in the notebook is ‘Clown.'”
“80 milliliters of pure water, 5 drops of tornapple juice, 7 grams of
black-rimmed sunﬂower powder, 10 grams of golden cloak grass
powder, 3 drops of poison hemlock. These are the supplementary
ingredients.”
“The main supernatural ingredients are: one crystal of the single horn
of a matured Hornacis gray mountain goat and a complete stalk of a
human-faced rose.”
Sirius seemed to have the Clown potion’s formula memorized as he
quickly ﬁnished writing it.
He paused for a moment and took a sip of coﬀee, then he unwound
the silver pendulum around his wrist.
He held the pendulum and closed his eyes, muttering terms to
himself such as “the end of days”, “peace of mind”, “hope for the
Lord’s blessings”, and “confess”.
After Sirius ﬁnished his prayer, Klein ﬁnally saw the pendulum
clearly.
Under the wound silver chain was a thumb-sized human ﬁgurine.
The ﬁgurine had a single eye, a trait unique to giants. It was facing
down, its legs bound by chains that connected upwards.
At that moment, the single eye of the giant suddenly had a faint red
glow.
Crack!
The scene Klein witnessed shattered as his legs buckled, almost
causing him to kneel to the ground.
Klein felt pain in his head as though he had been struck ruthlessly in
the head with a bat. His vision turned blood-red as his hands
involuntarily reached out to protect his knees.
He recovered several seconds later and stood back up. He felt that his
spirituality was unusually weak, as if he had heard the murmurings
that penetrated his mind once again.
But due to his progress in ‘digesting’ the magic medicine, the adverse
reaction calmed down quickly.
The Hanged Giant, the True Creator… Sirius and Hanass were both
members of the Aurora Order? But the Captain saw a huge cross in
Hanass’ dream. The terrifying being cruciﬁed on the cross wasn’t the
Aurora Order’s Hanged Giant… Klein took two deep breaths and
waited for his spirituality to slowly recover.
The Aurora Order was a secret organization that sprang into
existence about two to three hundred years ago. They worshiped the
True Creator and symbolized him with The Hanged Giant. They
believed that every human being had divine qualities, and as long as
they persevered and made it through the countless trials, they would
be able to accumulate enough divine qualities to become angels.
According to the internal records of the Nighthawks, the Sequence 9
of the Aurora Order was Secrets Suppliant. These Beyonders could
sense the existence of mysterious and horrifying beings and were
armed with a decent amount of knowledge regarding sacriﬁces and
some knowledge on ritualistic magic. There was enough evidence to
claim that senior Secrets Suppliants experienced distortions of their
worldview and lost control easily.
Little was known about the Sequence 7 which the Aurora Order had
grasped. Sequence 8 was Listener. This was considered quite a
terrifying ‘job’ for a Beyonder.
Every Listener could listen directly to the whispers of the secret
entities; thus, they frequently came into contact with powerful,
distorted, unique abilities. But consequently, if they were unable to
advance, it was diﬃcult for them to survive the next ﬁve years after
becoming a Listener. Furthermore, the comments the Nighthawks had
in the reports were that every Listener was a lunatic. Even if they
looked normal on the surface, they were always crazy on the inside.
The details of the report regarding the Aurora Order ﬂashed through
Klein’s mind. His initial theory was that Sirius was a Secrets
Suppliant.
From the description, Secrets Suppliant are as hopeless as Seers in battle.
That does ﬁt Sirius’s actions just now. What happened later was a loss of
control brought about by the injury? Yes, Frye once said that every
Beyonder would more or less undergo some weird changes after they die…
Klein thought as he tapped four points on his chest to praise the
Goddess.
After his spirituality recovered slightly, he concluded the ritual with
the appropriate procedure and dismantled the wall of spirituality.
With a whoosh, a gust of wind blew as Klein forced himself to look at
Sirius’s corpse.
He noticed that there was still an obvious wart on Sirius’s mangled
face. It was a dark purple wart, almost black. There seemed to be
liquid and a light gleaming within.
“What kind of transformation was that?” Klein rubbed his temples,
not daring to touch it.
He bent over and retrieved his cane, allowing it to bear his weight.
After what had just happened, he knew that Sirius’s spirituality had
been completely destroyed. Even the Spirit Medium Daly would be
unable to communicate with him.
After a while, Klein saw Captain Dunn and his partners, Leonard and
Kenley.
“It seems like your fate is tied to Beyonders and evil forces. In just a
few weeks, you have come across more supernatural incidents than
what we usually see in months,” Leonard joked, looking at the corpse
on the ground.
“It might not be a coincidence,” Klein added, as he suddenly thought
about the red chimney he had seen in his dream divination, as well as
the majestic palace on the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range
and the formless focus on him. He took the opportunity to mention it
in passing.
Dunn surveyed the surroundings and, with his gray eyes trained on
Klein, asked, “You tried channeling his spirit?”
There were still traces of Holy Night Powder and the scent of the
essential oils.
“Yes,” Klein replied truthfully. “I was worried that you would arrive
late and that the remains of his spirituality would scatter.”
“You don’t look well. Are you alright?” the short Kenley asked in
concern.
Klein passed Sirius’s undelivered letter to the captain and began from
the beginning.
“When I went to the underground market to purchase materials for
the rituals, I suddenly remembered that Selena had also once gone to
the Evil Dragon Bar and that it was Hanass Vincent that brought her
there. This meant that Hanass was a regular there. Thus, I suspected
that the person in the portrait, someone who’s deﬁnitely connected to
Hanass, might have gone to the underground market too.
“I asked the boss Swain about the portrait, and he gave me
conﬁrmation. He told me that the man had once tried to buy
documents and items related to the Hornacis Mountains. That
reminded me of the library. I recalled that the librarian had
mentioned that someone had just returned the journal issue I wanted
to borrow…”
Leonard stood to the side, listening with a smile. He suddenly
interrupted, “And so you brought your identiﬁcation documents and
badge here to ﬂip through the borrowing records? Actually, I am very
curious; why would you come into conﬂict with this man here? Even
if it was a direct encounter, with your style of doing things, you
would’ve pretended that you didn’t know him and would just leave
the library. Then you would come to Zouteland Street to ask for our
help.”
“Yes, there was no need for you to take the risk. As long as you
conﬁrm the target and that he hasn’t left Tingen, there would always
be a way to ﬁnd him,” Dunn added as he reviewed the letter.
Klein immediately said in embarrassment, “The librarian recognized
him and shouted for the police to help.
“There’s no way I could have pretended not to hear that…”
Leonard and Kenley looked at each other. One tried to cover his
amusement, while the other turned his head to the side.
Dunn nodded, his gaze leaving the letters.
“Did you get anything from channeling his spirit?”
“I saw a pendulum that took the shape of a Hanged Giant. I saw a
blood-red glow ﬂash in the giant’s only eye before I was forced out of
the ritual,” Klein described honestly.
He didn’t want to talk about the Clown potion for the time being as
he had two considerations.
First, if Dunn and the rest were able to ﬁnd Sirius’s hideout and the
corresponding records, then it would make no diﬀerence if he told
them or not, as there would be no additional contributions attributed
to him.
Second, if Dunn and the rest were unable to ﬁnd it, he could report it
in the future. This way, he would be awarded with another
contribution, allowing him to acquire the ingredients needed to
concoct a potion. This was a way to obtain double the rewards for a
single task, a technique that stemmed from Old Neil’s recent
teachings.
“Aurora Order?” Dunn muttered to himself before he asked some
relevant questions.
After Klein answered all his questions, he saw the fatigue in Klein’s
eyes and waved his cane.
“Not bad. You foiled a scheme that was targeting Tingen. You can go
back and rest. Kenley, bring Old Neil over.”
After giving out instructions, Dunn smiled bitterly and shook his
head.
“Before Sequence 6, Beyonders of the Sleepless pathway lack many
supplemental abilities. We can only conduct the simplest of ritualistic
magic.”
“Captain, you mean that from Sequence 6 onwards, a Sleepless
pathway Beyonder would gain improvements in the corresponding
aspects?” Klein asked out of curiosity.
“Yes,” Dunn conﬁrmed.
…
After leaving the Daﬀodil Street Library, Klein nearly fell asleep in
the carriage on multiple occasions on his way back to Daﬀodil Street.
He lumbered into the house, he then removed his hat and jacket
before falling asleep on the sofa.
Sometime later, he woke up abruptly, took out his pocket watch, and
snapped it open.
“Melissa will be back in half an hour, Benson in forty-ﬁve minutes…
If I don’t get up, I’ll have to make them wait an hour before we can
have dinner…” Klein rubbed his forehead as he entered the kitchen.
He washed his face with cold water, then took out the oxtail,
tomatoes, carrots, and onions he had bought that afternoon.
After he prepared the ingredients, he suddenly froze. He had the
feeling that his actions just now formed a strange juxtaposition with
the incident that afternoon.
“I am a man who just saved Tingen…” Klein mumbled in amusement.
He put on a white apron and got to making dinner.
Chapter 106: Artist Klein
After eight in the evening, in the Moretti family’s dining room.
As he looked at the shallow soup left in the bowl, Benson raised his
hand to cover his mouth to give a satisﬁed burp.
“Although that was our third time eating it, I still ﬁnd it delicious.
The sourness and sweetness of the tomato and the chewy texture of
the oxtail blends into a perfect and unique ﬂavor. Klein, I’m sorry
that the Blackthorn Security Company caused Tingen City to lose
such an outstanding chef.”
Melissa leaned backwards in her chair and nodded in agreement
silently.
“This is because you have yet to try real cooking.” Klein smiled
humbly. “If we have a chance in the future, let’s head to Bonaparte
Restaurant on Howes Street for some authentic Intis cuisine, and also
to Coastline Restaurant in the Golden Indus borough for some
southern delicacies.”
These were restaurants that were always covered in the newspapers,
where the average cost per person was around a pound and a half.
“I like your cooking more,” Melissa answered without hesitation.
Benson chuckled and changed the topic.
“But I ultimately feel that there’s something lacking from the tomato
oxtail soup. Perhaps, it shouldn’t be eaten with bread?”
Klein nodded in agreement.
“It’s best complemented with rice.”
“Rice…” Melissa muttered with an expression of yearning.
Tingen, which was located north, wasn’t considered a big city.
Besides a few particular restaurants, it was diﬃcult to have any
chance of eating rice.
To Benson and Melissa, this kind of food only existed in the
descriptions of newspapers and textbooks.
Looking at his sister’s expression, Klein laughed.
“Wait till we save another six month’s salary, and we will ﬁnd a
chance to go on vacation in Desi Bay and try the delicacies there.”
Desi Bay was located in the far south of the Loen Kingdom, and a
third of it belonged to Feynapotter Kingdom. It had plenty of sunlight
and beautiful scenery, and the paella there was very famous.
Before Melissa could share her opinion on saving money, Klein said,
“In another three months, I should get another raise. By then, we
could totally fulﬁll our desire to travel as well as save money for
necessities.”
“Why?” Benson and Melissa’s attention was redirected as expected.
Klein coughed lightly and smiled while explaining, “Due to my
professionalism, the police department which always collaborates
with our company intends to hire me as their part-time history
consultant. They would pay me extra, at least two pounds a week. If
you see me in a police uniform in the future and showing the
corresponding police documentation, please don’t be shocked.
“Of course, as you know, the work eﬃciency in governmental
departments is as slow as a ninety-year-old lady’s footsteps. They still
have to go through a lengthy procedure, and they’re required to do a
thorough inspection of me. Hence, on my oﬀ days for the next two
months, I’ll be heading to Khoy University quite often to see my
mentor and the teaching staﬀ I know to learn more.”
Seeing the shocked look in his brother and sister’s eyes, he paused
and said with a strange expression, “Just like Emperor Roselle said,
‘One is never too old to learn.'”
Benson maintained a few seconds of silence before saying in a half
self-deprecating and half emotional manner, “Is it too late for me to
sign up for university? Knowledge really is wealth.”
And also power… Klein added silently.
“Benson, you need Klein’s grammar books and his classic literature
textbooks,” Melissa said out of the blue, stealing the words from
Klein’s mouth.
Benson’s expression seemed to change. He gritted his teeth and said,
“Klein, pass me those books tonight.
“Even if all they do is put me to sleep, I am determined to read them
for an hour, no—an hour and a half a day.
“I swear in the name of the Goddess! If I can’t do it, I will be a curly-
haired baboon!”
A smile immediately plastered across Klein’s face.
“No problem.”
…
The next morning, Klein hung his coat and hat on the clothes rack in
the break room. Then he followed Rozanne’s instructions and walked
to the basement to the duty room outside Chanis Gate.
Captain Dunn and members Frye, Seeka, Royale, Leonard, and Kenley
were all there.
As his gray eyes glanced past the newly promoted Nighthawk, Dunn
smiled and said, “We have a routine meeting every Thursday to
summarize past missions and discuss various challenges.”
I am a man who has endured the test of many regular meetings as well…
Klein lampooned. He found a seat and joked, “Do I need to introduce
myself?”
Dunn smiled and turned to look at Kenley.
“Brieﬂy tell us about the investigation of Sirius Arapis.”
Kenley was also a Nighthawk who had been promoted from a
member of the civilian staﬀ. He wasn’t very tall, his brown hair was
quite thick, his body size was average, his muscles were very toned,
and he looked like someone who was smart and capable.
He thought and said, “With Old Neil’s help, we found Sirius’s secret
hideout. There were many books and items at the scene. From them,
we can be certain that Sirius was one of the underground members of
the secret organization, the Aurora Order. He was also a Secrets
Suppliant.
“There’s suﬃcient evidence to show that he and Hanass Vincent sold
the Antigonus family notebook to Welch. Those who don’t remember
Welch can ask Klein about him.
“We found valuable items, including three Sequence potion formulas,
which are Sequence 9 Seer, Sequence 8 Apprentice, and Sequence 8
Clown…
“The subsequent task is to use Sirius’s social circle and the letters we
found to locate other outer circle members of the Aurora Order. The
focus of our search will be directed at the heretic who has inﬁltrated
the police department.
“Also, people who were in contact with Hanass need to be
reinvestigated.”
Dunn nodded lightly and looked towards Klein.
“As you heard just now, we’ve obtained the Clown potion formula,
but are unable to determine if it’s real. We have to wait for the Holy
Cathedral to give us feedback.
“In the mission relating to the Aurora Order, you have made a crucial
contribution. Plus, given that you shot a member of the Secret Order,
it won’t be long until you accrue enough contributions to be
promoted. But, I have to remind you that not everyone is like Daly.
You have to suppress your desire and wait for three years. In order to
avoid losing control, you can’t allow your mindset to be aﬀected by
our discovery of the Clown potion formula.”
Captain, you don’t understand how magical it is to ‘act’… I have already
conﬁrmed the authenticity of the Clown potion formula using divination
above the gray fog last night… Klein nodded obediently.
“I will keep my emotions in check.”
Then Seeka Tron, the quiet Midnight Poet with white hair and black
eyes, said, “We still haven’t found any clues regarding Instigator Tris.
I suspect that he has already ﬂed from Tingen.”
…
After they were done exchanging their new information, Klein left the
duty room and found Old Neil to continue his mysticism lessons. In
the afternoon, he went over to his combat teacher, Gawain, to do
basic strength, endurance, and overall coordination training.
…
With the sun still up and bright at ﬁve.
Klein took oﬀ his training costume, took a quick shower, and
changed into his original clothing. He then took the public carriage to
Besik Street.
He hadn’t forgotten about the red chimney that he had seen in his
dream divination, nor did he forget about the man that he suspected
to be a member of the Psychology Alchemists who had bought
supplementary ingredients for the Spectator potion in the
underground market. These things would be inconvenient to
investigate in his role as a Nighthawk.
“Number 27. Henry’s Private Detective Company… Yup, it’s here.”
Klein found a private detective company according to the
newspaper’s descriptions. It was said to be trustworthy.
He put on a mask, lowered his top hat, and ﬂipped up his collar. He
walked up the stairs and came to the company on the second ﬂoor.
Knock! Knock! Knock! He knocked on the door that was half-closed.
“Please come in,” said a voice that seemed that be aﬀected by
phlegm.
Klein lifted his cane and pushed the door to enter. He saw the
detective company using an almost open layout. There were four
employees sitting at their respective seats partitioned into small
cubicles.
“Hi, I’m Detective Henry. How may I help you?” a man in a white
shirt and black vest greeted him.
He held a smoking pipe in his hand, and he had a prominent jawline,
blade-like eyebrows, and dark blue eyes that sized up his client.
Klein used the collar of his windbreaker to block half of his face as he
spoke.
“I have two matters to entrust to you. How are your rates?”
“That depends on the diﬃculty of the task.” Detective Henry
retracted his gaze and pointed towards the sofa in the guest area.
“Let’s talk over there.”
Klein followed him to the semi-partitioned area and sat on the single-
seat sofa. He didn’t take oﬀ his coat, nor did he take oﬀ his hat and
mask.
He purposely made his voice hoarse and said, “First, I need you to
help me ﬁnd a house with a chimney that looks like this, as well as
information on who the owner and current tenant are.”
As he spoke, he took out a neatly folded paper. When he opened it,
there was a chimney with its color noted down and its surrounding
scenery.
This was the drawing that Klein completed by using the uniqueness
of the area above the gray fog and the method of praying to himself.
“What a great drawing…” Detective Henry complimented
subconsciously. He then knitted his eyebrows and said, “This is not
complicated but very tedious. It would require a long time and a
large amount of manpower.”
“I understand.” Klein nodded lightly.
Detective Henry pondered for a moment and said, “Seven pounds.
The price for this job would be seven pounds. In addition, you have
to give me at least two weeks.”
“Alright. Second, help me ﬁnd this gentleman and ﬁnd out his
identity. The only thing I know is that he occasionally appears at the
Evil Dragon Bar near the harbor borough. And he must not detect any
men you send. He is very sensitive and he has terrifying
observational skills.” Klein took out the second portrait.
He intended to get in touch with a member of the Psychology
Alchemists to see if he could ﬁnd any valuable information and
materials. For example, perhaps a formula that could be exchanged
with Justice?
“Three pounds, such a mission would cost about three or four
pounds. Your outstanding drawing skills will help my assistant and I
save time,” Detective Henry replied skillfully.
“Ten pounds in total?” Klein found the price upsetting.
Detective Henry took a puﬀ on his pipe and said, “Yes, and you need
to put a deposit of two pounds. When there’s progress, you’ll need to
pay another three to ﬁve pounds. The rest of the payment can be
made when the mission is completed.”
“Then I shall come next week to check on your progress.” Klein didn’t
haggle over the price to prevent the observant detective from
remembering any of his characteristics.
After they signed a standard contract, he took out two one-pound
notes and passed them to the detective. He only had one pound and
seventeen soli left from his savings.
As Detective Henry watched the man wearing a gauze mask and a
black windbreaker with its collar raised leave in a hurry, he had a
suspicious look in his eyes as he smoked his pipe.
Why is he looking for a house that has that kind of chimney?
He must be an artist, or at least a professional sketch artist of some sort…
…
In the afternoon, in Viscount Glaint’s luxurious mansion.
Audrey, with her maidservant in tow, followed etiquette and passed
her hand to the host. She looked at him giving her hand a quick peck.
“Your beauty accentuates my salon,” Glaint ﬁrst gave a compliment
as usual. Then, he lowered his voice and said, “That lady is already
here. She’s a Beyonder and also an author.”
Chapter 107: Fors
Novel
“Author?” Audrey asked casually as she observed Glaint’s reaction.
Subsequently, she didn’t have to mind the presence of her
maidservant, Annie, since they chatted about ordinary topics.
Glaint straightened his body and chuckled.
“Yes, I believe that you have read her works in the past. She wrote
the book, Stormwind Mountain Villa, which was highly acclaimed for
the past two months.”
“I enjoyed that book, especially the calm Lady Sissi,” Audrey replied
with a faint smile.
Meanwhile, she was rolling her eyes at her own hypocrisy inwardly.
That was because her latest hobby had nothing to do with novels. She
had stopped reading Stormwind Mountain Villa a month ago, her
progress stopped at the one-third mark.
Ever since she joined the Tarot Club and acquainted herself with the
powerful Fool, and became a real Beyonder, she had been immersing
herself in mysticism knowledge. She had been systematically learning
about psychology and had lost interest in other activities.
Smiling, Glaint guided Audrey to a sofa in the hall.
“I am sure that Miss Fors Wall will leave a good impression on you,
for she is just like Stormwind Mountain Villa’s Lady Sissi—calm,
intellectual, and lazy.
“Also, my dear Miss Audrey, are you going to play the piano for us
later? That is the greatest compliment for a novel and literature.”
Audrey looked at the side proﬁle of Glaint’s face. His expression,
tone, and body language all conveyed his intention to ﬂaunt himself.
He wants to use me to show oﬀ… Audrey thought to herself, as if she
had just met this good friend of hers for the ﬁrst time.
She maintained her elegant smile and said, “My music teacher, Mr.
Vicanell the pianist, said that my standards have deteriorated
recently and needs more practice.”
“Alright.” Glaint was just about wondering what to say when he
suddenly saw a lady taking desserts from the long table. “Audrey, this
is Miss Fors Wall, the author of Stormwind Mountain Villa.”
Audrey looked over. Miss Fors Wall was about 23 years old and 1.65
meters in height. She was wearing a pale yellow dress with frills. Her
brown hair was slightly curly. She looked over with her pale blue
eyes as Glaint introduced her while wearing a smile that appeared
ruminative.
Audrey had noticed several small details in the less than three
seconds of observation.
There are faint traces of yellow on Miss Fors’s ﬁngers… She likes
cigarettes…
There are obvious calluses on her ﬁngers at spots used to hold a pen,
ﬁtting her identity as an author…
Her arm movements show that she has decent strength. This is not a
quality expected of an author, unless she is passionate about
exercising. Perhaps she was born like this, or she might have engaged
in some other occupation in the past…
She displayed her calm, rational, and precise style in Stormwind
Mountain Villa. This must be linked to her previous occupation…
Her eyes and emotions are relaxed, giving me the feeling that she is
looking down on me and Glaint. Is this the psychological superiority
a Beyonder has over an ordinary human?
If it was a coincidence that Glaint discovered her identity as a
Beyonder, then she should feel some anxiety and uneasiness. After
all, she is unable to guess his reaction and what he would do next
since the unknown always brings about fear.
This indicates that she was the one who voluntarily approached
Glaint, having learned about our hobbies. She must be quite
conﬁdent about what is going to happen next…
Why would a Beyonder approach Glaint? Does she need monetary
support, or the Beyonder ingredients stored in the treasury? Or
perhaps she needs help with something…
At this moment, Glaint was introducing Audrey to Fors.
“Madam, this is the Miss Audrey that I mentioned previously, the
most sparkling gem in all of Backlund. Her father is Count Hall, a
trusted aide of His Majesty and respected member of the cabinet.
“Good afternoon, Madam Fors. Stormwind Mountain Villa is still
seated by my bed to this very day.” Audrey adhered to the rules of
the aristocracy and curtsied.
But she added silently, That’s because I haven’t ﬁnished reading it
even after a month…
They merely exchanged praises as they were in public.
After watching Fors continue towards the dining table as she targeted
a cream cake, Audrey retracted her gaze and headed to the living
room with Glaint.
She recalled the details she had seen just now and tried to ﬁgure the
motives of the woman. She wanted to gain some advantage in future
conversations.
As she took a step forward, Audrey, who was as calm as an objective
Spectator, stepped on her dress and nearly fell.
At this moment, her personal maidservant, Annie, caught her,
allowing her to maintain her grace.
“Miss, the unique design of this dress means that you cannot walk too
quickly,” Annie pulled close to Audrey’s ear and reminded her softly.
“I know.” Audrey nodded in reply, her face ﬂushed red.
I was too absorbed in observing others that I forgot to look at where I
was placing my foot… she silently complained in resentment.
Audrey met with many other esteemed authors, critics, and musicians
for the rest of the salon, always maintaining her sweet, elegant smile.
Finally, after her facial muscles began turning sore, she saw Viscount
Glaint’s signal.
She waited for a few minutes and gave the excuse of needing to use
the washroom. She lifted her dress and stood up slowly to leave the
salon.
After conﬁrming that there was no one tailing her, she made her way
to the study on the ﬁrst level and told her maidservant Annie, “I have
something to discuss with Glaint. Guard the door for me. Do not let
anyone enter.”
“Alright.” Annie didn’t feel that the request was strange, for she knew
that Audrey and Viscount Glaint shared similar hobbies and would
often discuss mysticism in a private setting.
Audrey entered the study and locked the door. She saw Glaint seated
behind the desk while playing with a pen. Fors Wall was standing in
front of the bookshelf, nonchalantly ﬂipping through a book.
“I’ll introduce you both again. Madam Fors, a true Beyonder.” Glaint
put down his pen and walked over.
“Is that so?” Audrey intentionally exaggerated her feelings of doubt.
Fors returned the book to its original position and turned around
with a smile.
“It looks like I have to prove myself.”
She walked over to the door and extended her right palm, grabbing
the handle of the door.
Suddenly, Audrey’s vision blurred. It was as if she witnessed Madam
Fors turn incorporeal as she passed through the door.
She was shocked. Concentrating, she realized that Fors was no longer
standing in her original position.
A few seconds later, the door handle turned. The locked door was
opened just like that. Fors Wall smiled as she walked in from the
outside. Audrey’s maid, Annie, who was not far away, didn’t seem to
be aware of what had happened.
“What a magical ability!” Glaint exclaimed.
Audrey took in a deep breath and said, “I have no more doubts.”
At the same time, the ability Fors had displayed allowed Audrey to
conﬁrm what her true motives were, since acquiring money or
materials would be no trouble for a Beyonder like that.
Glaint doesn’t have any Beyonder guards… Fors wants to use the
statuses and resources available to Glaint and I to achieve something?
Audrey tried her hardest to act as a Spectator.
Fors chortled and said, “Let us interact with honesty. We do not have
much time left.”
“I was once a doctor at a clinic and was given an opportunity to
become a Beyonder. That was more than two years ago.”
“I hope that you can do something for me, and the reward I will give
you is allow you to join the ranks of true Beyonders. I will sell you
the formula of a particular Sequence potion and its corresponding
materials.”
Upon hearing such a promise, Glaint could not help but ask, “What
do you want us to do?”
“I have a partner who’s in jail now, awaiting the ﬁnal verdict. I hope
that you can save her, regardless of the methods used,” Fors said
simply.
Audrey frowned.
“Madam Fors, the abilities you have demonstrated should be better
suited for the task…”
Fors laughed and shook her head.
“No, that is not the case. She cannot pass through the places that I
can. I can only go in regularly and chat with her.
“Also, I think that risking my life to save her is not a good idea. Life
is short, but there is much for us to do.”
Audrey observed Fors’s face and body language. She considered her
words before asking, “I understand. What crime is your partner being
locked up for?”
Fors’s expression immediately turned a little awkward.
“My partner is a very respected person who can make others comply
from the bottom of their hearts. She is of good character and kind.
Well… Uh… It was that the means she used to convince a thug was a
little over the top…”
…
After handing out the mission, Klein followed his original schedule of
mysticism lessons in the morning and combat lessons in the
afternoon. The regularity of his life almost made him forget that he
was a member of the Nighthawks. The ‘curse’ of often encountering
supernatural incidents seemed to disappear as well.
It was Saturday, his turn to guard Chanis Gate.
“You can enjoy the coﬀee I left here or the black tea in the clerk’s
oﬃce.” Dunn surveyed the room with his deep gray eyes.
Klein, who had already given an excuse to his siblings, nodded in joy.
“Alright Captain. You sure are a generous gentleman.”
Dunn laughed.
“Those will help you relax. Being tense all the time is not good for
your health.”
He took his hat and cane and walked toward the door.
As he was exiting the door, he suddenly turned around and said, “I
forgot to remind you; do not open Chanis Gate no matter what you
hear, unless it is opened from the inside.
“Remember, no matter what you hear, no matter what happens.”
Captain, that’s a little scary… Klein tensed up instantly. He felt the
darkness of the basement triumph over the light of the gas lamp.
Chapter 108: Deep Into The
Night
Despite not being dawn yet, the well-ventilated but quiet and dark
underground was illuminated by gas lamps. The dim yellow light
emitted from the gas lamps were protected by glass, allowing them to
steadily shine throughout the empty and quiet tunnel.
Klein sat in the duty room and casually ﬂipped through the
newspapers, magazines, and books piled before him. He directed
some of his attention outside, to prevent anyone from charging inside
the Chanis Gate.
His windbreaker and top hat were hung on the clothes rack near the
entrance while his cane was leaning against the wall where it could
be easily retrieved.
The rich aroma of coﬀee ﬁlled the air, and Klein couldn’t help but
take a whiﬀ. He massaged his temples to ﬁght against the heavy head
feeling he was experiencing and the weariness of his body.
As a college student back on Earth, he often slept at ﬁve in the
morning and woke up at noon, while staying up all night during the
past two to three years of working life, to the point of being able to
attend work energetically the next day. However, it was all thanks to
the games that were too exhilarating, novels that were too
interesting, television shows and movies that were too entertaining.
This world obviously didn’t possess any of the necessities needed for
staying up all night.
“Seriously, Emperor Roselle. If you want to posture, do it properly.
Pour your limited life into an unlimited enterprise. Lead the people of
this world into the information age!” Klein muttered silently. He
could only console himself that there were at least newspapers,
magazines, and increasingly interesting novels.
At ﬁrst, he wanted to focus on his studies to restrain his sleepiness.
However, practically speaking, it conﬂicted with his duty. Once he
entered that state, he would easily overlook any movements outside
and any changes to the situation at the Chanis Gate.
Phew. Klein picked up his coﬀee cup and carefully blew at it.
He took a sip and let the fragrant taste swish around his mouth
before letting the liquid slowly ﬂow down his throat.
“Fermo Coﬀee from the Paz Valley, very bitter but very refreshing,”
Klein gave a compliment and put down his coﬀee cup.
The Paz Valley was located in the Southern Continent, a region that
produced high-quality coﬀee beans. It was currently being fought
over by the Intis Republic and the Loen Kingdom. They both built
colonist settlements on the left and right banks of the Paz Valley, and
had destroyed the original Paz Kingdom.
In the eerie silence, Klein casually picked up a magazine and realized
that it was Ladies Aesthetic, which talked about fashion and dating.
“This must be from Rozanne…” he murmured in amusement as he
ﬂipped through it with his interest piqued.
Maybe it was due to the sudden advancement of camera technology
in the past decade or so, not only did the magazine use a lot of
illustrations, it even used monochrome pictures as their content—just
like the newspapers.
They fashionably invited the famous play and musical actors to
model the charms and the magical pairing of the clothing. In a short
span of seven years, the new regional Backlund magazine became a
mainstream magazine that spread across the nation.
“The dress looks nice, she’s pretty too…” Klein ﬂipped through it
casually and didn’t hide his aesthetic inclinations.
He was a man that had matured normally both in body and mind. He
had always appreciated beautiful ladies, but he had long set his goal
—to ﬁnd a way home. Hence, he tried his best to keep his distance
from the opposite sex, so that he didn’t waste the other person’s time
or leave behind any emotional baggage.
As for streetwalkers, he was quite a germaphobe in that aspect.
Benson and Melissa were already shackles that couldn’t be removed.
He could only ﬁnd the means to make it up to them in the future…
Klein suddenly felt his heart heavy and he couldn’t help but let out a
sigh.
The further he strayed away from home, the more he felt melancholic
during quiet late nights.
He suddenly lost his interest in looking at beautiful women and put
down the magazine in his hands. He picked up a novel instead.
“Stormwind Mountain Villa, author, Fors Wall,” Klein read the
content on the cover.
The tranquil night, dim yellow light, and the leatherbound book
reminded him of his younger days when he rented books. Hence, he
continued to read simply because of nostalgia.
Stormwind Mountain Villa was a novel about Lady Sissi, who was
1.65 meters tall and weighed ninety-eight pounds. It was a story of
her embarking as a home tutor in the Fruys Mountain Villa.
“One pound is about half a kilogram… Is this Jane Eyre of an
alternate world?” Klein caressed his ﬁngers against the smooth paper
as he began making guesses of the subsequent content.
However, just as he thought it was a romance novel, an evil spirit
emerged in the story. When he believed that it was a ghost story,
Lady Sissi revealed herself as a detective and made a marvelous
deduction.
Just as Klein felt that it was deﬁnitely a detective novel, the main
male character took a heavy blow to the head and lost his memory.
Then, it became a heart-rending drama.
“… In the end, it’s still a romance book.” Klein closed the book and
drank a mouthful of coﬀee.
Thump!
Thump! Thump! Thump!
A ferocious knocking was suddenly heard as it reverberated in the
dim and quiet empty corridor.
Klein jumped in shock as he immediately turned tense.
He instinctively drew his revolver from his armpit holster, adjusted
the cylinder and hammer. Then, he slowly walked to the door and
looked for the source of the sound.
Thump! Thump! Thump!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
The thumping became more and more intense. Klein looked in the
direction of the sound and saw the black outward-swinging gates that
were engraved with seven Sacred Emblems.
“Sounds from beyond the Chanis Gate?” He squinted his eyes and his
heart was beating like a drum.
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Klein saw Chanis Gate shake gently, and he sensed the massive
impact it was withstanding.
“It can’t be, right… I’m encountering something on my ﬁrst day on
duty? Did I get an unlucky constitution after I transmigrated?” Klein’s
right hand broke into cold sweat as it held the revolver.
Very soon, he recalled the Captain’s instruction: do not open Chanis
Gate no matter what you hear, unless it is opened from the inside.
Uh, could this be a normal phenomenon? Klein suddenly calmed down.
Bang! Bang! Bang! Thump! Thump! Thump! The commotion beyond the
Chanis Gate grew in intensity, but the heavy black metal gates only
shook. Otherwise, it didn’t show any unusual signs.
“This is normal. I nearly died from the shock…” Klein muttered,
before he prepared to return to the duty room.
Just then, he heard a sharp grinding noise. He looked at the heavy
Chanis Gate bulging outwards as a crack appeared on in its surface!
Zing!
In the jarring noise, Klein’s almost ﬁxed eyes saw a ﬁgure. Its height
was about the length of a man’s arm, and it was wearing a classic,
black, miniaturized regal gown. There was an obvious stain on the
gown.
It had a not-so-exquisite face, black eyes, and tightly sealed lips.
It was a cloth puppet, a toy cloth puppet!
At that moment, when Klein was about to subconsciously raised his
gun to take aim, the cloth puppet leaned heavily into the crack in
Chanis Gate and unfurled the paper it was holding.
There were many mysterious symbols on the paper, some that Klein
knew and some that he had yet to learn. Together, they formed a
vertical eye!
Klein had yet to understand the situation when the regal-gowned
puppet was suddenly dragged back by a shapeless force to the back of
Chanis Gate!
Creak!
Chanis Gate closed once again, with no more knocking or pounding
sounds.
The basement regained its tranquility and silence as though nothing
had happened.
“I have to inform Captain that Chanis Gate was opened from the
inside… But it closed itself…” At that moment, Klein’s mental
facilities returned to him as he felt alarm, fear, and doubt.
A few seconds later, he recalled what the cloth puppet was. Since he
was an oﬃcial member of the Nighthawks, he was given the
clearance to know about the Grade 3 Sealed Artifact sealed behind
Chanis Gate.
“Number: 0625.
“Name: Misfortune Cloth Puppet.
“Danger Grade: 3. Considerably dangerous. It has to be used
carefully. It can only be applied for operations that require three or
more people.
“Security classiﬁcation: Oﬃcial Nighthawk member or above.
“Sealing method: Only needs to be separated from humans.
“Description: The cloth puppet is wearing a regal gown which was
popular in around the year 1300. The gown has a stain that is almost
impossible to remove. It is uncertain if the stain was present from the
very beginning.
“In a few tragic cases of individual family ﬁnancial crises recorded in
Tingen, the police noticed the existence of the puppet. It was always
placed in the children’s bedroom, on the side table next to the bed.
“A few Nighthawks accepted the request and started an investigation
on the puppet.
“The initial evaluation determined that it brought misfortune,
causing people around it to be unlucky and ﬁnd themselves in
danger. Finally, they would die one after another. It only took two
weeks for the tester to reach the brink of bankruptcy.
“The puppet isn’t equipped with the capability to live. It doesn’t have
any inclinations of escaping the seal.
“Through extended periods of experimentation, we discovered that as
long as one does not come within ten meters of it for more than half
an hour a day, one wouldn’t be tainted with misfortune. If misfortune
has befallen someone, the person will immediately have his situation
turn for the better as long as the misfortune is transferred to another
person.
“Appendix: The puppet ﬁrst appeared in the house of an old lady,
Tess, who lived in the Lower Street of Iron Cross Street. She was a
toymaker. Due to old age and her husband’s severe illness, with both
her children passing on early, she had no choice but to move to the
Iron Cross Street’s Lower Street.
“This was the last toy she sold. She exchanged the puppet for some
poison hemlock and ended her and her husband’s lives, having
starved for more than three days.”
As Klein recalled the information of Sealed Artifact 3-0625, he felt
even more doubtful and horriﬁed.
Didn’t it say the puppet isn’t equipped with the capability to live? Didn’t it
say that it doesn’t have any inclinations of escaping the seal?
What did I see just now!?
What dragged it back in the end?
The symbol that was drawn on the paper that it unfurled, what does it
mean?
That scene earlier was like how a psychotic murderer deals with his
victim as the victim slams on the gates heavily and cries for help
desperately, only to be dragged back…
While these thoughts ﬂooded him, Klein decided not to make any
decision on his own.
He returned to the duty room and pulled a rope.
The rope tightened, the gear spun, and there was suddenly a hurried
ringtone that rang on the second ﬂoor of the Blackthorn Security
Company.
Leonard Mitchell and the other Sleepless who were playing cards in
the entertainment room immediately put down their poker cards and
ran to the basement.
Chapter 109: Deduction
The sound of running footsteps entered Klein’s ears, calming him
down as he stood at the entrance of the guard room.
Leonard arrived ﬁrst, holding a revolver. He asked in a solemn voice,
“What happened?”
Watching Leonard struggle to stop, Klein suddenly thought of
something that Rozanne had mentioned in the past. Three years ago,
Leonard, who had just become a Sleepless, tried to run down the
ﬂight of stairs despite not having adapted to the potion’s power,
causing him to fall and roll down.
With a cough, Klein pointed at Chanis Gate and said, “There was a
knocking noise from the inside, which then became a loud slamming
noise. Then the door was pushed open a little.”
“Chanis Gate was pushed open?” the short Kenley asked in shock.
“Yes, a slit was opened.” Klein continued his description. He saw that
Leonard, Kenley, and Royale had stopped approaching the guard
room, instead forming an arc formation a few steps away, loosely
surrounding Klein.
He paused for a moment before asking, “Are you suspicious of me?”
“No, it isn’t suspicion. This is protocol.” Kenley shook his head.
In this tense atmosphere, Leonard maintained his ﬂippant attitude,
laughing as he added, “There have been incidents like this in other
churches. The Beyonder guarding Chanis Gate lost control and pulled
the bell before killing two teammates who came to help.”
“Alright.” Klein no longer felt angry and aggrieved at being
ostracized. Instead, he asked, “Then how should I prove that I haven’t
lost control?”
Leonard wiped away his ﬂippant smile and tapped his chest four
times. With a hoarse voice, he recited softly, “Lacking clothes and
food, they have no shelter in the cold.
“They are drenched by rains, and huddle around the rocks for lack of
shelter.
“They are orphans snatched from the breast, hope lost on them; they
are the poor that have been forced oﬀ the proper path.
“The Evernight did not forsake them, but bestowed them with love.”
…
The holy, yet pitiful prayer reverberated around the basement,
making the bodies, hearts, and souls of everyone present feel puriﬁed
and tranquil.
Seeing Klein not display any abnormal reactions, Leonard stopped his
recital and smiled.
“There’s no problem. You are still our trusted partner.”
Madam Royale, who had been quiet all this time, looked at Chanis
Gate and asked, “What did you see when the gate was pushed open?”
“I saw a Misfortune Cloth Puppet, the one wearing the black classic
regal gown, 3-0625,” Klein replied, still a little fearful. “But three
seconds later, a formless power pulled it back and Chanis Gate was
closed once again. What’s going on?”
Leonard, Kenley, and Royale exchanged looks.
“Heh heh, we are in the same boat as you. We don’t know the true
cause. But since Chanis Gate is closed once again and there’s nothing
unusual, we shouldn’t enter it at this time. We have to wait till dawn
for the Captain.”
Royale calmly added, “I will wait here and guard the gate with you.”
“Alright.” Leonard moved his hand and gave a bantering laugh. “As
the most powerful person here, I shall stay too. Kenley, return to the
second ﬂoor just in case the police department has an emergency case
and cannot open the door.”
Kenley didn’t say much, he just nodded immediately and left.
Leonard glanced at Klein and Royale.
“Perhaps we can continue our card game? It’s best to have some sort
of entertainment in circumstances like this, to relax.”
“No problem.” Klein adjusted his revolver and put it back into his
armpit holster. Royale didn’t voice an opinion, but instead stroked
her smooth, black hair as she entered the guard room.
While playing Fighting the Landlord, no—Fighting Evil, Klein said
casually, “Misfortune Cloth Puppet, I mean 3-0625, according to its
description, isn’t equipped with the capability to live…”
“Haha, three aces.” Leonard showed his hand and replied with the
same casual tone, “In the past forty years, 3-0625 hasn’t displayed
any life-like characteristics. We can ﬁrst assume that the information
is correct and make our assumptions based on that.”
“Pass. You already have an idea?” Royale asked simply.
As Klein hesitated to think about whether he should throw his three
deuces, Leonard took a sip of his freshly brewed coﬀee and said,
“Yes, since 3-0625 shouldn’t have any life-like characteristics, then its
actions today must have been inﬂuenced by some other factor. This
factor must also be rather recent; otherwise, we would’ve observed
this phenomenon a long time ago.”
“Has there been anything diﬀerent about Chanis Gate over the last
month?”
Royale saw Klein toss his three deuces and pondered for a few
seconds.
“There is only one thing diﬀerent; the Antigonus family’s notebook
and the Sealed Artifact 2-049 was stored behind Chanis Gate for a
night.”
Leonard looked at the cards in his hand and as he tapped the table,
he said with a smile, “If 2-049 can make the Misfortune Cloth Puppet
act abnormally, then something similar should have happened behind
Backlund’s Chanis Gate a long time ago. So I suspect that the problem
lies with the Antigonus family’s notebook.”
Klein thought for a moment and nodded.
“That is the most likely explanation… Leonard, I never expected you
to be this good at deduction.”
Typically speaking, being a romantic poet and a person with
excellent deductive skills was mutually exclusive…
“That’s because he’s recently into detective novels,” Royale explained
indiﬀerently. “Two Kings, a straight from 8 to King. Does no one
want it? Three 6’s and no more.”
Upon seeing this, Klein and Leonard fell silent.
Having not been concentrating on the game, they forget something
important.
Royale was the ‘Evil’ in this round!
Watching Royale cut the deck, Klein took the opportunity to ask,
“Then what power pulled 3-0625 back?”
Leonard glanced at him and chuckled.
“Do you really think that the defensive mechanisms behind Chanis
Gate only consists of the buried sealed chamber and a few elderly
keepers?
“In reality, when the sun sets fully, the keepers would have already
left Chanis Gate and returned to Saint Selena Cathedral.
“The power in the gate is strongest at night and is no longer safe for
any living creature. The power only weakens when the sun rises
again. That is also why the Captain asked us not to enter Chanis Gate
no matter what we hear.”
In other words, the Captain had forgotten to tell me the reason…
Klein thought for a bit before asking, “Defensive mechanisms such as
nexus formations?”
Like magniﬁed versions of amulets and charms?
“Yes.” Royale nodded as she stroked the edge of her cards. “There is a
reason that Chanis Gates are placed in the central cathedral of each
city. The gate is maintained by the followers that go to these
churches every day. Their sincere prayers allow a part of their
spirituality to enter the nexus formations, and from small
contributions comes abundance.”
“I see…” Klein nodded as he saw that he had a lousy hand.
At that moment, Leonard laughed and said, “There isn’t just one
defensive mechanism behind Chanis Gate. Saint Selena’s ashes are
buried inside. She was a High-Sequence Beyonder when she was still
alive.”
The ashes of Saint Selena? Ashes of a High-Sequence Beyonder?
Sacred ashes? What use do those have? Klein was as puzzled as he
was curious.
Saint Selena was a devotee when the Church of the Evernight
Goddess was being established. She was active during the Third
Epoch and her deeds were written in many holy scriptures. Thus,
Saint Selena was a fairly commonly-used name among the
commoners who believed in the Evernight Goddess.
Leonard seemed to read Klein’s mind as he continued, “Rumors
suggest that the skeleton or ashes of High-Sequence Beyonders still
contain incredible power. Of course, those are just rumors.”
Klein nodded, focusing his attention on the cards in his hand.
There were no unusual incidents in Chanis Gate for the next few
hours, but Klein lost exactly two soli. It pained his heart, but
Leonard, who fully expressed his romantic poetic vibes while playing,
lost four soli and ﬁve pence, leaving Royale as the undisputed
winner.
“The sun has just risen, it’s my turn.” The quiet Author, Madam
Seeka Tron entered the guard room at six.
Klein wrote the incident he encountered the previous night into the
record book and returned to the Blackthorn Security Company with
Leonard and Royale.
He felt unusually exhausted, but the Midnight Poet and Sleepless
beside him remained energetic.
This is the diﬀerence between the diﬀerent Sequences… Klein was
just about to make his way past the partition and catch up on some
sleep at home when he suddenly saw the Captain enter.
“Good morning, Captain.” He couldn’t help but yawn when he
greeted him.
Dunn, who was in a black windbreaker, took oﬀ his hat and looked at
him with his gray eyes.
“Good morning. You should head back home for some rest. Did
anything happen last night?”
Klein immediately gave a succinct summary of the incident regarding
the Misfortune Cloth Puppet and Leonard’s deduction.
“Okay.” Dunn didn’t give his opinion. He concentrated on making his
way to his oﬃce. “I will send a telegraph to the Holy Cathedral.”
Klein didn’t stay any longer. He slowly walked out of 36 Zouteland
Street and breathed in the cool morning air.
He felt a little more energized, suddenly remembering something he
had forgotten all this time.
I forgot to tell the Captain and the rest about the piece of paper in the
Misfortune Cloth Puppet’s hands!
How could I have forgotten?
It was as if some power was inﬂuencing me, stopping me from telling
this to the other Nighthawks…
It has been some time since the Antigonus family’s notebook was
present at Chanis Gate. The Misfortune Cloth Puppet 3-0625 should
have been aﬀected long ago. Why did it only show abnormal
behavior last night?
Was it because it was the ﬁrst time I was on shift at Chanis Gate?
It used all of its power to show me the picture on the paper?
What is the motive of the Antigonus family’s notebook?
Has it got to do with my survival despite making contact with it? And
that I became a Seer?
…
Many suspicions ﬂashed through Klein’s brain, rooting him to the
spot. He was unsure if he should pretend that he didn’t remember
anything and make his way home to sleep, or head up and report it
to the Captain.
Chapter 110: Conﬁrmation
After thinking for a while, Klein decided to return home to conﬁrm
something.
He believed that if the Misfortune Cloth Puppet hadn’t intentionally
shown him the picture on the paper, then the Captain and the rest
would deﬁnitely ﬁnd traces in their follow-up investigations. It
wouldn’t matter much if he reported it or not.
If it were the converse, it was something worth careful consideration.
That was also what Klein wanted to conﬁrm.
He took the trackless public carriage to Daﬀodil Street. When he
returned home, his brother Benson and his sister Melissa had yet to
wake up, since it was Sunday. The living room was dark and quiet.
Klein boiled a kettle of water, threw in some tea leaves, and drank it
with wheat bread. Then he took his coat, hat, and cane towards the
stairs.
He subconsciously lightened his footsteps to avoid making any loud
noises.
Just as he got to the second ﬂoor, he saw the bathroom door
suddenly open, and Melissa, who was wearing an old dress, came out
with a sleepy face.
“You’re home…” Melissa was rubbing her eyes sleepily.
Klein covered his mouth and yawned.
“Yeah, I need to crash. Don’t wake me up before lunch.”
Melissa tersely acknowledged when she suddenly recalled something.
“Benson and I are going to Saint Selena Cathedral pray and attend
Mass in the morning. Lunch might be slightly later.”
As not-so-devoted believers of the Evernight Goddess, she and Benson
went to the church once a fortnight, while Klein, who was a
Nighthawk, hadn’t entered the church since the last time he was
followed by the member of the Secret Order.
No, I’m at the cathedral every day, just that I’m in the cathedral’s
basement… Klein justiﬁed himself subconsciously.
He was currently most worried that the Goddess would abandon him
as a fake believer. If his ritualistic magic didn’t respond at crucial
times, he would be in big trouble.
But then, when one considers Old Neil, the Goddess is quite forgiving
towards the Nighthawks. Hmm. That’s right! Klein comforted himself.
His scattered thoughts ﬂashed past him, and he looked at Melissa. He
nodded and smiled.
“No problem. I can sleep longer then.”
Walking past Melissa, he entered his bedroom and locked the door
behind him.
Immediately following that, he psyched himself up and took out the
ritual dagger and created a sealed spirituality wall.
He took four steps counterclockwise while reciting the incantation
and withstood the chaotic roars before appearing above the gray fog.
In the illusionary boundless world, he was the only living spirit
sitting on the seat of honor at the long bronze table.
For nearly a minute of silence, Klein conjured a piece of goatskin
parchment and wrote down a divination incantation.
“The picture that the Misfortune Cloth Puppet displayed.”
Although Klein had seen the mysterious picture on the paper clearly
for a split moment last night, he only managed to remember the
rough shape of the picture due to his anxiety. But that wasn’t a
problem for a Seer; he could reproduce anything he remembered and
had seen once!
According to mysticism theory, one’s spirituality could remember
everything they had seen. As long as they possessed the appropriate
method, they could reproduce the scene whenever they wished.
Klein even felt that the theory that Spirit Medium Daly described
regarding the Psychology Alchemists made sense. Human memory
was merely islands that were exposed above the sea; it couldn’t
withstand much. Hence, a person’s spiritual essence remembered
most of the information and turned it into the subconscious, which
formed the entire ocean.
While spirituality itself, even if it wasn’t the entire ocean, also
included the entire sea region surrounding the island.
After reciting the divination incantation, Klein leaned backwards and
fell asleep through Cogitation.
In the blurry, distorted, separated world, he saw Chanis Gate crack
open once again as he heard the heavy grinding noises.
The puppet in the black classic regal gown leaned into the opening of
the door and unfurled the paper that it was holding.
On the piece of paper, there were many mysterious symbols that
collectively formed a vertical eye.
Klein carefully observed the picture before exiting the dream. Then,
with the aid of the uniqueness of the world above the gray fog and
the memory that had yet to fade, he expressed the image on the
brown parchment.
The vertical eye looked up at him, looking both sinister and
mysterious.
Klein thought and wrote below the eye, “This is key to the treasure
that the Antigonus family left behind.”
Putting down the pen, he untied the silver chain that was wound
inside his sleeve. As he held it with his left hand, the topaz pendulum
stably hung above the divination statement and the mysterious
vertical eye. There weren’t any obvious movements.
Klein closed his eyes and recited the sentence with his mind cleared.
After seven times, he opened his eyes and saw the topaz spinning in
small circles in a clockwise fashion along with the silver chain.
That meant aﬃrmation.
The vertical eye picture is really key to the treasure that the Antigonus
family left behind… Klein nodded in deep thought.
He tapped his ﬁngers on the edge of the long bronze table and
muttered to himself, “Because of Ray Bieber’s death, there are no
descendants of the Antigonus family left. Hence, the notebook views
me, the Seer that interacted with it but remains alive, as its inheritor?
“It aﬀected 3-0625 and left the key to the treasure with it, only to
show it to me during my shift at Chanis Gate?
“There doesn’t seem to be any problem with the logic, but it still
doesn’t seem very convincing.
“How could the notebook be sure that there are no more descendants
of the Antigonus family?
“And I am totally unrelated to that family… If I shared their
bloodline, the original Klein wouldn’t have committed suicide to
begin with.
“Hmm, it doesn’t seem to matter if I tell this to the Captain and the
team. Let me look into this.”
Klein then divined the location of the Antigonus family’s treasure.
But, unsurprisingly, there was no detailed information. Just like in
the letter that Sirius wrote to Mr. Z, Klein could only be certain that
the treasure was related to the main peak of the Hornacis mountain
range and the ancient Nation of the Evernight.
After he ﬁnished divining all the matters, Klein noticed that the
crimson star from which he had previously heard prayers was
producing a faint ﬂuctuation again.
He used the method of answering prayers and touched the illusory
star. He saw the brown-haired young man who wore the unique black
tight suit again.
The young man was kneeling on the ground, facing the pure crystal
ball, still muttering about something.
Klein, who had purposely learned some Jotun, ﬁnally understood one
of the sentences.
“Pray… Save… Father and Mother.”
It really is Jotun… Where in the world is Jotun still used? That’s an
ancient antique that is thousands of years old… What a pity; the
mysterious ruler above the giant is totally powerless. I don’t have the
ability to save them even if I want to… Klein shook his head and sighed.
He decided to observe him for a little longer.
I’ll see what I can do when I master more Jotun vocabulary and can
understand what happened to his father and mother… Klein retracted his
spirituality, wrapped it around himself, and initiated a descent.
When he returned to his bedroom, he dispelled the spirituality wall,
changed into old but comfortable clothing, and laid down on the bed
to get some sleep.
Klein slept all the way till half-past twelve, which was when Melissa
ﬁnished preparing lunch and came knocking on the door.
After having a fairly sumptuous meal, he saw Melissa bring out her
new dress and ﬁshnet hat, looking like she was going out.
“Do you still have something this afternoon?” Klein asked, puzzled.
Benson was seated on the sofa, knitting his eyebrows at his grammar
books. He didn’t lift his head but answered on her behalf, “Mrs.
Shaud from next door told Melissa that there will be a lecture
regarding family aﬀairs in the municipal hall in the afternoon.
Melissa plans to attend it and learn how to deal with daily household
issues.”
Melissa nodded and said, “I got Selena and Elizabeth to join me.”
“That’s nice. I hope that the lecturer tells you that a family like us
needs to hire at least one maidservant,” Klein joked.
Noticing that Melissa was about to refute him, he immediately added,
“We have to invest our limited time into more valuable matters.”
Melissa was stunned. After a while, she puckered her lips, put on her
ﬁshnet hat, and left the house.
…
At two in the afternoon, Klein arrived at the Blackthorn Security
Company again.
Rozanne and Dunn Smith, who happened to be in the reception hall,
asked in unison, “Didn’t you go home and rest?”
Klein smiled.
“I was going to go to the Divination Club, but I kept thinking about
what happened last night, so I decided to come over here ﬁrst. Has
there been any reply from the Holy Cathedral?”
Dunn shot a glance at Rozanne and turned around silently. He
walked past the partition and entered his oﬃce.
Rozanne pulled her face at his back, then muttered angrily,
“Seriously, Captain…”
Well done! Klein complimented silently. He held back his laughter
and followed Dunn into his oﬃce.
Klein shut the door, and Dunn sniﬀed his smoking pipe before he
said, “The Holy Cathedral has determined that the disturbance was
because of the Antigonus family notebook, which they reclassiﬁed as
a Grade 1 Sealed Artifact. It’s a pity. That means that you no longer
have the suﬃcient security clearance to read it.”
Grade 1. Highly dangerous. Only the ranks above bishops and Nighthawk
team captains can know of the actual situation? That also means that
Captain has no idea what’s happening… Highly dangerous, no wonder…
Klein felt regretful yet relaxed.
Dunn gave him a glance and continued, “The Holy Cathedral told us
to check if there are any other items behind Chanis Gate that were
contaminated by the notebook. After veriﬁcation, only 3-0625 was
abnormal, and we have already changed its seal.”
“Did you discover anything else?” Klein pretended to ask curiously.
Dunn shook his head.
“No.”
Klein nodded in thought. He didn’t continue with the topic. After
some small talk, he bade farewell and left for the Divination Club to
continue his ‘journey of digestion’.
…
In the municipal hall.
The three best friends, Melissa, Selena, and Elizabeth, sat near the
door, waiting for the lecture to begin.
“If she delivers a bad lecture, we’ll sneak out,” Selena suggested
excitedly.
Elizabeth immediately agreed, “Let’s go shopping at Harrods.”
Chapter 111: Letting Slip
Sometime later, the lecturer, who had relatively high cheekbones,
walked up the wooden podium. She cleared her throat and said,
“Good morning, kind, charitable ladies. I am Xaviera Hedda. What I
am about to share with you today are my experiences in managing
family expenses. There are three parts, the ﬁrst being how a family
with an annual income of a hundred pounds should balance food,
housing, clothing, and employing helpers. The second would be
where a family earning two hundred pounds yearly should be
increasing their expenditure to appear more decent…”
Melissa listened attentively. She had her brothers’ annual income at
her ﬁngertips.
It’s already over two hundred pounds… she thought, half in relief
and half in fear.
She was relieved and satisﬁed with her current life, but was also
afraid that this way of life would vanish in the blink of an eye.
At this point, the wine red-haired Selena covered her mouth. She told
her two friends quietly, “She seems to be a believer of the Lord of
Storms. She’s wearing a Windstorm badge.”
Melissa looked over and saw Xaviera wearing a badge depicting
violent winds and tumultuous waves on her left chest.
She quickly explained, “Mrs. Shaud who told me about this seminar
is also a follower of the Lord of Storms. I don’t think it’s strange that
the speaker is a follower too.”
“Yeah, I don’t think there is a problem here. We are here to learn
how to budget,” Elizabeth concurred with Melissa.
“But other than Melissa, we don’t need to, nor do we have the right
to govern our families’ ﬁnances.” Selena pouted.
Elizabeth rebutted without hesitation, “But we’ll get married
eventually and form our own families.”
Selena had been a little afraid of Elizabeth after the incident of the
demon mirror divination. She nodded in embarrassment and
pretended to listen to the lecture attentively.
The lecturer, Xaviera, raised her right hand and said, “The premise of
any form of budgeting is to respect the opinion of the man of the
household. They are the source of income, the pillar of the family.
They face anxiety, stress, troubles, and disorder in society in order to
obtain everything for us. Thus, we have to create a serene home, one
free from troubles from the outside. This will allow them to relax
when they come home, allow their souls to be cleansed, allow them
to be more prepared to face the challenges to come…
“So, as the famous philosopher, sociologist, humanities scholar, and
economist Mr. Leumi once said, a woman is the angel of a
household.”
Selena stroked her cheek and traced her dimples as she whispered
with a little excitement, “Leumi, the person who said that humans are
born free?”
Elizabeth hesitated before answering. “Yes, but he is a believer of the
Lord of Storms.”
At this point, the lecturer, Xaviera, continued, “Mr. Leumi also
informs us that females are innately ﬂawed when it comes to
intelligence and logic. In that case, unable to judge for themselves
whether they should accept the judgment of father and husband as
that of the church….” <sup>1</sup>
Melissa, Selena, and Elizabeth looked at each other, speechless, after
hearing such a description.
“Let’s go?” Selena ﬁnally suggested.
Melissa and Elizabeth nodded.
“Alright!”
They took their veiled hats and bent over, sneaking over to the side
door in an attempt to leave without attracting any attention.
When they cautiously arrived outside and could ﬁnally stand up
straight, they suddenly heard a burst of applause coming from the
small hall.
Melissa instinctively looked back into the hall.
She saw Mrs. Shaud, as well as many other ladies, clapping.
Phew! Praise the Lady… Melissa exhaled. She left the uncomfortable
place together with Selena and Elizabeth.
“Shall we go to Harrods?” Selena suggested as she stood under a tree.
She had already forgotten about what had just happened.
Melissa fell silent for a few seconds before saying, “I plan on
returning home to study.”
“Study…” Selena ﬁddled with her wine-red hair, as if she had
returned to her regular life.
“Also, I have to buy bread, beef, potatoes, and fruits… Klein needs to
work today, Benson went to the municipal library. So, yeah, I have to
go back!” Melissa suddenly realized how much she loved her
textbooks, her gears and springs.
Selena decided to keep her distance from the unusually weird
Melissa. She turned to look at Elizabeth and smiled dutifully, “Shall
we go to Harrods together? Even though I’ve spent all my savings, it’s
still wonderful to window shop.”
“Sure.” Elizabeth accepted the suggestion, then asked casually,
“Melissa, does your brother, Klein, have to work on Sundays?”
“Yes, he rests on Mondays, diﬀerent from ordinary jobs.” Melissa
unknowingly raised her head slightly.
…
After leaving the Blackthorn Security Company, Klein took a public
carriage to Howes Street.
He tried his hardest to suppress his emotions, to not think about the
issue of the Antigonus family’s treasure. He tried to focus his
attention back onto the matter of acting.
It was important to fully digest the potion as soon as possible!
Improving himself was extremely important no matter when it was!
Acting as a Seer, heh! I’m not professional enough. The fortune tellers
back in the Foodaholic Empire had to go through the almanac all the
time before they accomplished anything… Klein held his cane as he
sat inside a carriage.
He had decided to divine if it was beneﬁcial for him to travel to the
Divination Club today.
That was more beﬁtting of a Seer!
As he was getting oﬀ the carriage, Klein took out a halfpence coin.
His ﬁeld of vision narrowed, his pupils becoming darker as he silently
recited, It is suitable to head to the Divination Club today.
It is suitable to head to the Divination Club today.
…
Dang!
Klein ﬂicked the coin up. He didn’t look at the rotation of the coin,
calmly extending his hand instead.
Thunk! The halfpence landed in the middle of his palm.
This time, the number 1∕2 was facing up.
With the number facing up, that means that I would encounter an
unfortunate incident at the Divination Club today… Klein thought for
a moment before he turned to the opposite side of the street. He
waited for the public carriage that was headed for Daﬀodil Street.
He felt more and more like a charlatan.
…
Howes Street, at the entrance to Harrods Department Store.
Selena was just about to enter the building when she suddenly froze
and looked to the side.
“Did something happened?” Elizabeth asked, puzzled.
Selena puﬀed her cheeks and said, “Elizabeth, I thought about my
mysticism teacher, Mr. Vincent. He passed away just like that, the
morning after my birthday…”
“Could it be because I peeked and used his secret incantations? I’ve
always felt guilty and uneasy because of this… Besides, I’ve been
rather unlucky recently.”
“So?” Elizabeth asked quietly.
Selena bit her lips and said, “I wish to do a divination at the
Divination Club over there and see if Mr. Vincent’s death had
anything to do with me.”
From what happened at my birthday banquet… I have this nagging
feeling that Elizabeth is hiding something from me… I remember the
back of the man in a tuxedo…
“Can’t you divine it yourself?” Elizabeth asked in surprise.
Selena sighed, imitating her father.
“Sigh, I cannot divine it given my current condition.”
“Alright, let’s head to the Divination Club ﬁrst.” Elizabeth agreed to
her friend’s suggestion.
They headed over to the side and made their way to the Divination
Club on the second ﬂoor by following the stairs.
“Hello, good afternoon, Miss Angelica. It’s a pleasure meeting you
again.” Selena gave a lively greeting at the reception area.
Angelica smiled and said, “You should be able to ﬁnd me here as long
as you come after lunch.”
Selena exchanged niceties before lamenting Hanass Vincent’s death,
she then said, “I need to have a divination performed.”
“You know the rules of the club. Here is the list of members willing
to do it… It’s the weekend, so most of our members are here,”
Angelica explained like clockwork.
Selena and Elizabeth huddled their heads together as they scanned
the list of names and description together.
“I used to just ask for my teacher directly. To think that the club
would have this many members willing to do divinations compared
to last year,” Selena said excitedly.
Suddenly, she paused for a few seconds and said in puzzlement,
“Klein Moretti, Klein Moretti? Isn’t this name the same as Melissa’s
brother?”
Elizabeth froze. She looked repeatedly at the name ‘Klein Moretti’
and nodded, “That’s true…”
“Miss Angelica, is this Mr. Klein Moretti around?” Selena asked with
a sparkle in her eyes.
Angelica shook her head.
“My apologies, Mr. Moretti didn’t come to the club today.”
“Alright, we’ll ﬁnd someone else.” Selena didn’t mind not seeing the
person, but she laughed at her friend. “I know that this can’t be
Melissa’s brother, but having seen this name, I naturally thought of a
newspaper; a headline worthy of the Intis Press.”
The Intis Press was created by Emperor Roselle, famous for its
attention-grabbing headlines. It was one of the most famous
newspapers in the Northern Continent.
Elizabeth asked inattentively, “What headline?”
Selena cleared her throat and said, “Is it the decay of morals, or a
problem with society? History graduate actually ends up doing
divinations over the weekends to make a living!”
Chapter 112: Azik's Explanation
Backlund, Empress Borough.
Audrey Hall sat on a suspended chair in a windy corner and looked at
the ﬂowers that were blooming under the sun. She thought of Fors
Wall’s request.
According to Viscount Glaint, there really was a young girl named
Xio Derecha being impounded at a temporary prison located in
Backlund’s North Borough.
She was charged with grievous assault against a decent gentleman
due to a ﬁnancial conﬂict. She caused the man to be bedridden, and
he might not be able to stand on his feet ever again.
Regarding that, Fors’s explanation was that the gentleman wasn’t a
nice person but the head of a gang in Backlund’s East Borough. He
made a living by being an usury.
The cause of the incident was when one of the borrowers found out
that the interest was several times higher than he expected, so much
so that it was impossible to return the amount of money even after he
bankrupted himself. When his discussion with the gentleman ended
fruitless, he found the famous intermediator, Xio Derecha, hoping
that she could persuade the other party to waive the unreasonable
portion of the loan.
That gentleman didn’t respond well to Xio Derecha’s attempts at
arbitration, and even threatened to capture the borrower’s wife and
children that night. Hence, Xio Derecha switched tactics and chose to
use physical means. Accidentally, she caused severe damage to the
man.
Viscount Glaint investigated the matter and conﬁrmed that Fors Wall
was telling the truth. He also conﬁrmed that the gangster had lost
control of his underlings. Moreover, after a midnight visit by
someone, the borrower’s debts were waived. A statement was sent to
the prosecutor to plead mercy for Xio Derecha. However, an assault
case of such severity wasn’t dropped even when the victim decided
not to pursue a trial.
“Glaint wished to solve the problem through normal means. He sent
people to talk to lawyers that he was familiar with, but they were
only conﬁdent of winning a lighter sentence, but it would be very
diﬃcult to acquit her from the crime unless she obtains a medical
certiﬁcation stating that she is mentally incompetent or mentally
undeveloped…” Audrey muttered to herself, leaning in support
towards her friend’s opinion.
To her, it was best to not have any relationship with Fors Wall and
Xio Derecha. Ever since the Tarot Club, Audrey felt that she was no
longer an innocent and naive young lady.
“Tomorrow night, there will be a dance at Count Wolf’s residence. I
should tell Glaint then to act according to the lawyer’s suggestion.”
Audrey nodded slightly as she made a decision.
In the Loen Kingdom, lawyers were either barristers or solicitors. The
latter didn’t need to be involved in court aﬀairs, and were responsible
for gathering evidence, talking to the parties involved, setting up
wills on their clients’ behalf, supervising property allocation, and
providing legal consultation. Of course, they could also represent
their clients to attend the most basic magistrate court and defend
simple cases.
Barristers, on the other hand, were responsible for researching
evidence and defending their clients in court. According to the Loen
Kingdom’s laws, they had to maintain an objective attitude so they
couldn’t make direct contact with the litigant. They could only
communicate with them through their assistants, who were solicitors,
to gain complete understanding of the situation. They were all true
law experts who possessed outstanding communication skills and
were skilled in debate.
The relaxed Audrey observed the colorful ﬂowers outside while
hidden in the darkness when she recalled something.
Medical certiﬁcation stating she was mentally incompetent…
Psychiatrist…
If the Psychology Alchemists have grasped ‘acting’, does that mean that
they can be found amongst psychiatrists?
Audrey felt that her train of thought was on the correct path, and her
eyes shimmered like a lustrous gemstone.
Just then, she saw her golden retriever, Susie sneak behind the ﬂower
bushes, to a spot where only the gardener would be able to reach.
Susie… What is she doing? Audrey hid in the shadows and looked in a
daze.
The golden retriever’s sense of smell seemed to be confused by the
ﬂowers all around her that she failed to notice her owner behind her.
She opened her mouth and produced sounds that was akin to one’s
exercising of their voice.
Then, it caused the surrounding air to vibrate into words that were
jerky and unmellow.
“Hello.
“How are you?”
…
Audrey’s mouth widened as she completely forgot about the etiquette
an elegant lady should have. She couldn’t believe the scene before
her and the stiﬀ voice that she had just heard.
She suddenly stood up and asked, “Susie, you can talk? When did you
learn how to talk?”
The golden retriever jumped in fright as she turned around to look at
her owner.
She shook her tail nervously and very quickly. She opened and closed
her mouth a few times, vibrating the surrounding air.
“I… I don’t know how to explain. I am a dog, after all.”
Upon hearing that, Audrey was suddenly at a loss for words.
…
Monday morning, Klein followed his plan to revise and consolidate
his mysticism knowledge. Then, he took the public carriage to Khoy
University.
He wanted to increase his interactions with Mr. Azik and ﬁnd out
exactly what he knew.
In the three-story gray building of the history department, Klein and
his teacher, Cohen Quentin, chatted for a while and exchanged their
information regarding the historical ruins on the main peak of the
Hornacis mountain range.
Having not learned anything new, he seized the opportunity to enter
the oﬃce diagonally opposite when his mentor left to handle certain
matters. He then walked over to Azik’s desk. The lecturer had stayed
behind to take care of some matters.
“Mr. Azik, can I have a chat with you?” He asked the man with the
tanned skin, gentle facial features, and the small mole below his right
ear. He took oﬀ his hat and bowed.
With eyes that seemed to have seen the vicissitudes of life, Azik
tidied his books and replied, “Sure, let’s take a walk by the Khoy’s
banks.”
“Alright.” Klein held his cane and followed him out of the three-story
gray building.
Along the way, they maintained their silence. Neither of them spoke.
When the ﬂowing river water entered their vision and there were no
teachers or students passing by, Azik suddenly stopped in his tracks.
He turned his body halfway, faced Klein, and asked, “Is there
something I can help you with?”
Klein remained silent for a long while, thinking of several tactful
ways of asking his questions, but he gave up on all of them.
Therefore, he spoke frankly and directly asked, “Mr. Azik, you are a
trustworthy person, a respectable gentleman. I would like to know
what you can see in me, or should I say, what do you know? I am
referring to the previous incident when you said that there was
something disharmonious in my fate.”
Azik put down his cane and sighed as he laughed.
“I never expected you to be so straightforward. I’m quite at a loss
how to answer you.
“To be frank, disharmony in your fate was the only thing that I could
see. Other than that, I don’t know any more than you do.”
Klein hesitated and asked, “But how could you tell? I don’t believe
that this was derived from divination.”
Azik looked sideways towards the Khoy River. His intonation was
tainted with some bleakness.
“No, Klein, you don’t understand. Divination can reach that kind of
level. It only depends on the person doing the divination. Of course,
my divination was merely an excuse.
“Some people are… special. They are born with some strange ability.
I think I am someone like that.”
“You think?” Klein acutely caught the word that the other man used.
“Yes, I am not sure if I was born with it. Perhaps, the price of my
ability is to forget myself, to forget my past, to forget my parents.”
Azik’s eyes were clouded with melancholy as he looked at the river.
Klein was increasingly confused.
“Forget the past?”
Azik smiled without any humor.
“Before I entered the Backlund University’s history department, I lost
most of my memory. I only remembered my name and some basic
knowledge. Luckily, I still had my identiﬁcation documents.
Otherwise, I probably would have ended up homeless. All these
years, I’ve tried to search for my parents using my identiﬁcation
documents, but I never found anything, even though I could see a
corner of Fate.
“During my few years in the university, I gradually realized that I
possessed some strange but unique powers, powers that go beyond
common sense.”
Klein listened attentively and asked, “Mr. Azik, why did you lose
your memory? No, I mean—did you ﬁnd out why you lost your
memory?”
He suspected that Mr. Azik was a member of the Life School of
Thought who had lost his memories, and that he might even be a
Mid-Sequence Beyonder that held an above average position. It was a
secret organization that had potion Sequences for Monster and
Soothsayer. It was an organization that was mainly passed down
through master-disciple relationships.
Azik shook his head vigorously.
“No, it felt like I just had slept, I’ve forgotten everything that
happened in the past.”
He walked forward a few steps with his cane in his hand. He spoke as
he walked.
“After I left Backlund, I started dreaming. I dreamed about a lot of
strange things…”
Dreams? I am good at interpreting dreams! The conversation was
entering Klein’s domain of expertise as he immediately asked, “What
kind of dream?”
Azik let out a muﬄed laugh and said, “Many diﬀerent kinds of
dreams. Sometimes, I would dream of the internals of a dark
mausoleum. I would dream of ancient coﬃns with corpses in them.
They would have white feathers growing out from their backs.
Sometimes, I would dream of myself being a knight covered in armor,
holding a three-meter-long spear while charging towards the enemy.
“Sometimes, I dream of myself as a feudal lord, having a rich and
fertile ﬁef, with a beautiful wife and three children. Sometimes, I
dream of myself as a tramp, walking on a muddy road in the rain,
feeling cold and hungry.
“Sometimes, I dream of myself having a daughter, a diﬀerent
daughter than the previous children. She would have long smooth
black hair, and she enjoys sitting on the swing that I made. She
always asks for sweets from me. Sometimes, I dream of myself
standing next to the gallows, looking towards a dead body hanging
up there coldly.”
Listening to Azik raving like a madman, Klein suddenly realized that
he couldn’t interpret the dreams because his various dreams
symbolized opposite, contradictory things!
Azik retracted his gaze as his voice no longer sounded ethereal.
“The Feynapotter Kingdom in the south believes in Mother Earth, and
the Church of Mother Earth promotes a belief. They believe that
every life is a plant, absorbing the nutrients from the earth. Growing
slowly, prospering, and withering.
“When they wither, these lives fall to the earth and return to the
mother’s embrace. In the coming year, they grow again. They would
blossom then wither, year after year. Life is as such, one life after
another.
“Sometimes, I am very willing to believe in this concept. I believe
because of my uniqueness, I can dream of previous lives, and the
lives before that.”
At this point, he looked at Klein and said with a sigh, “I haven’t
mentioned any of this to Cohen before. The reason I’m telling you is
because I…”
Azik paused and smiled.
“I apologize. My description earlier was not precise enough. The
disharmony in your fate is not the only thing that I could see. I can
also see another thing.
“Klein, you are not an ordinary person anymore. You possess an
extraordinary, strange power, one very similar to mine.”
Chapter 113: Request
Mr. Azik can tell that I’m a Beyonder? His ability is truly powerful…
Klein froze for a moment before he gave an honest reply.
“Yes.”
He thought for a while before adding, “Because of what happened to
Welch and Naya.”
“It’s as I thought…” Azik sighed. “There were two people with
extraordinary powers amongst the group of police that came to
question me and Cohen.”
It was probably Captain and Leonard. They were in charge of Welch’s
case… Klein nodded slightly, not interrupting Azik.
Azik raised his cane and said, “You should have entered their circle. I
hope that you can help me search for clues of my origin. You do not
need to go out of your way to do it, just note it down if you ﬁnd any
clues.”
Upon saying that, Azik wore a bitter smile.
“I don’t know any other person with extraordinary powers… You
cannot imagine what emotions a man without a past has. You are like
a boat ﬂoating in a vast ocean. The most terrifying thing is not facing
a storm, but not being able to ﬁnd a harbor. The inability to navigate
to shore. All you can do is take on disaster after disaster, with no end
in sight, never to feel peace and safety.”
No Mr. Azik, I know how it feels, for I am in a similar position.
Fortunately for me, I have the memory fragments of the original
Klein, as well as Melissa and Benson…Klein answered silently before
he asked, “Mr. Azik, why didn’t you join a similar group when you
possess such magical ability and search for clues yourself?”
Azik looked into Klein’s eyes and let out a self-deprecating smile.
“Because I’m afraid. I’m afraid of death.”
He sighed and continued, “I have gotten used to life like this. I like
my life. I don’t have the courage to take that risk, so I can count on
you.”
Klein didn’t say any more. He promised, “I’ll pay special attention if I
come across any clues.”
“Alright, we should return to the oﬃce. Let’s have lunch together
with Cohen when he’s done with work. Do you remember? The East
Balam Restaurant in the university is quite good. Heh, my treat.”
Azik lifted his cane and pointed to a direction.
My apologies, I really have no memories of that. How could the
studying original Klein have aﬀorded the East Balam Restaurant?
Even if Welch was treating, he would still reject going to such an
expensive place… Klein pressed on his hat and returned to the third
level of the grayish-stone building which housed the history
department with Azik.
A few steps later, Azik suddenly spoke.
“I’ll be on summer break after I ﬁnish settling all my work at the
university. You can visit me at my house or write to me.”
Klein nodded and said casually, “Mr. Azik, I thought that you would
head to Desi Bay for a vacation.”
“No, it is too hot in the south right now. I don’t like the so-called
sunbathing. Look at my skin color; it tans easily. I’d rather head to
the Winter County, to the north of the Feysac Empire to ski, sightsee,
or hunt seals.” Azik, who had a copper skin tone, smiled as he
replied.
I would too… Klein, who had just joined the Nighthawks, revealed a
look of envy.
After lunch, Klein returned home and took a nap before beginning his
revision and study of charms and amulets. He hoped to grasp them
quickly to create objects that could at least be used in battle and help
him.
When it was approaching three in the afternoon, Klein packed his
stuﬀ and sealed the room with a wall of spirituality.
…
In the majestic divine hall above the gray fog sat a long, ancient
mottled table.
Klein sat at the seat of honor, his face enveloped by the thick fog. He
looked at the still-obscured Justice and The Hanged Man as they
appeared at their designated seats.
Hmm, Miss Justice’s emotions doesn’t seem too stable. Worry,
unease, and a little lost… Klein observed the only female member of
the Tarot Club with his Spirit Vision.
Words couldn’t describe Audrey Hall’s emotions. She was extremely
shocked by Susie’s sudden speech.
She had imagined a future with herself as a great detective or famous
psychologist bringing along her assistant Susie, but if that became the
dog detective Susie bringing along her assistant Miss Audrey, then it
would be a little, a little…
No, not a little, it would be straight up weird! It leaves me lost!
Audrey suddenly sat up straight. She wanted to request for Mr. Fool’s
and The Hanged Man’s help.
But she swallowed the words she was about to say.
Hmm, how should I ask this? What should I do if my pet is
abnormal?
How should I interact with a pet that can speak, one that has decent
intelligence?
No, no, no, this is the Tarot Club, not an experience sharing on pets. I
bet that the good impression that The Hanged Man and Mr. Fool have
of me would shatter if I ask those questions!
Audrey’s mind whirled. Finally, she organized her words and said,
“Honorable Mr. Fool and Mr. Hanged Man, who has helped me all
this time, I have a question to ask. What can a pet with Beyonder
powers do for its owner? In other words, how useful is it?”
She had just said her piece when she noticed Mr. Fool and The
Hanged Man slip into silence. The atmosphere became a little weird.
Hey hey hey, say something, don’t look at me with those eyes, I did
nothing! Really, I was asking for a friend! Audrey wanted to burrow
into a hole out of shame.
She deeply regretted asking that question.
Considering that she had previously asked what would happen if an
ordinary animal consumed a Sequence potion, did she share the
potion she formulated with her pet? That seems like something only
Miss Justice would do… I feel a little pathetic being the boss of a
‘heretic cult’ with her as a member… Klein lifted his right hand and
propped it against his forehead and pinched it twice without giving
an answer.
The Hanged Man Alger Wilson was silent for nearly twenty seconds
before he replied in a strange tone, “That depends on what kind of
Beyonder powers the pet has. For example, if it’s a Spectator, then it
can help you observe or listen in on certain occasions. As you know,
most humans are wary of each other, but would never suspect that a
pet would be eavesdropping on them, even if the pet was sitting right
by their feet.”
It makes sense! Father would avoid me when discussing important
matters with the nobles, cabinet members, and other ministers. They
would often lock the door to the room. But if Susie could hide long
enough to be locked in with them, then she wouldn’t be chased
away… Also many ladies like to interact within private social
circles… Audrey had a sparkle in her eyes as many thoughts welled
in her mind.
Also, since Susie can speak now, she can tell me the content of the
meetings directly… Susie is great! I have to treat you well. I have to
teach you proper pronunciation and vocabulary…
Hmm, should I teach Susie the aristocratic pronunciation or a more
normal Backlund accent? Would other dogs pick up on where Susie
comes from when they interact? Wait, why am I considering this?
Susie wouldn’t use human language when interacting with other
dogs…
Wait, Mr. Hanged Man, why did you use Spectator as an example?
C-could you have guessed what happened?
Audrey’s expression changed. She regained her posture and smiled.
“Mr. Fool, I found another page of Emperor Roselle’s diary.”
I got this from Fors Wall.
“Great, you have repaid what you owed,” Klein replied in a good
mood.
“I am sorry, but there’s not much content on this page of the diary.”
Audrey was conjuring the content she remembered onto the piece of
goatskin.
Klein raised his hand and made the goatskin parchment appear in his
palm before saying, “That doesn’t aﬀect my promise. Furthermore,
the parts of the diary you handed me previously had two pages.”
The pages collected by Justice and The Hanged Man were not
originals. They were copied by researchers. Some would copy it on
one page for recording purposes, while others kept the original look
of the diary for convenience.
Klein looked down at the few lines of text on the page.
“December 20th. A new year approaches, but the feedback I received
is making me very confused and troubled.
“There is no crude oil in this world! There’s no crude oil to be
found!”
Chapter 114: The Standards of a
Member
No crude oil? It couldn’t be found for some reason, or there really wasn’t
any available?
From the period Emperor Roselle was assassinated till this day, about
a hundred and ﬁfty years have passed, and there are still no traces of
crude oil…
Klein’s pupils constricted as his hand quivered while holding the
diary.
No crude oil not only meant that the future of the internal
combustion engine became uncertain, it would also lead to a state of
stagnation in the chemical industry. In other words, Earth’s modern
industrial age would never transpire here!
In short, the development of this world was uncertain to Klein.
Although he couldn’t invent things, he had assumed that he was still
at an advantage because he knew a bit of everything and could
foresee the direction of technological development. When he saved
enough money, he could make a risky investment on an industry that
he thought showed promise. Furthermore, he wouldn’t put all his
eggs in one basket.
Klein thought that it was only a matter of time until he could own
enormous wealth. By then, he would hire the so-called white gloves
as representatives to establish international charity foundations. On
the surface, they would provide relief to the poor. In reality, they
would actually be establishing and funding a revolt, in order to ﬁght
against the higher strata of society and enhance the living standards
of the people in the lower class.
If he were to ﬁnd a method of returning to Earth, he would segregate
his property. A third to Benson, a third to Melissa, and a third for his
foundation.
However, it was a pity that his perfect vision of the future was
instantly half-shattered.
Luckily, there’s still electricity and magnetism in this world. The telegram
is a successful example, I should mainly invest in this in the future…
Klein settled down and read down row by row.
“December 21st. I’m no longer thinking about crude oil anymore.
Upgrading my Sequence level is what matters!
“December 22nd. The ﬁlthy environment in Richeux Borough is
unacceptable. If I hadn’t visited incognito, I might’ve never known
that it still looks the same as when I was young. I want to gather all
my ministers and formulate a ‘Capital Sewer and Public Toilet
Enhancement Plan’. Hmm, I have to rectify the people’s bad habits.
Let them boil hot water for consumption, wash their hands and faces
frequently, don’t litter, don’t pee and poop anywhere, use condoms if
possible… Haha, I thought of what to name this campaign: the
Patriotic Health Campaign!
“Hence, the invention of the condom has to be brought forward.
There’s also masks, paper cups, and others. Yes, even the most
primitive version would do. Give it a try. I have to thank this world
for they still have rubber trees.
“December 23rd. Perhaps I should consider that suggestion. Keep a
back door for myself outside of the Church of the God of
Craftsmanship. For example, I could join that ancient and mysterious
organization which inﬂuences the world from the shadows?”
Klein then suddenly realized that there was nothing else at the
bottom. His emotions were indescribable.
Emperor Roselle, what was the name of the ancient and mysterious
organization that was inﬂuencing the world from the shadows? Do I know
it?
How could you stop here? Why didn’t you write more?
It’s just like when I used to read novels. When I read till the end and
realized that the author ended up dropping the novel…
And Patriotic Health Campaign? The Emperor sure knows how to have
fun…
The contents of the diary should’ve been written after he became the
Consul of the Intis Republic. He might already have called himself the
Emperor Caesar.
I have to read some books when I get back and ﬂip through some
historical texts of other countries. I have to see which year the ‘Capital
Sewer and Public Toilet Enhancement Plan’ took place.
After his nearly twenty seconds of silence, Klein reined back his
thoughts and let the diary in his hands vanish into thin air.
“You can start your discussion now.”
Audrey let out a breath of relief and adjusted her state to become a
Spectator. She smiled faintly and said, “I’d like to know if there are
any Sequence potion named Tribunal, or a kind of Beyonder that can
go through wooden doors or make locks ineﬀective?”
I know about this… Enveloped in the grayish-white fog, Klein was
going to reply, but The Hanged Man answered ﬁrst.
“I need you to help me investigate something in return for the
answer.”
“What is it?” Audrey asked with interest as well as with puzzlement.
Alger glanced towards The Fool and said, “I’d like to know if the King
has the intention of taking revenge on the Feysac Empire and
launching a new war on the East coast of Balam within this year or
before June of next year.”
The Tarot Club was currently using the Loen language, which was
conﬁrmed by the trio’s accents at the ﬁrst Gathering. Hence, Alger
knew that Miss Justice was a noble in the Loen Kingdom while he
also believed that Miss Justice knew that he was a Loen.
As for The Fool, Alger believed that His behavior as a Loen was
merely a disguise, a disguise that would ease the discussion.
Ever since the ritualistic magic, Alger started using ‘Him’ to address
The Fool politely.
Audrey recalled everything that she heard from various social events.
She nodded conﬁdently and said, “No problem, but I would need
suﬃcient time to be certain.”
“I can wait.” Alger smiled and said, “With Mr. Fool as a witness, I
believe you wouldn’t go back on your promise.”
Audrey looked towards the quiet yet mysterious Fool engulfed in gray
fog as the corner of her mouth curved upwards.
“But I think the value of this information is worth more than both
questions put together.”
“When you conﬁrm the answer, I’ll provide compensation depending
on the situation,” Alger replied with an answer he prepared
beforehand.
Miss Justice, Mr. Hanged Man, do you need virtual currency to determine
value?Klein smiled and leaned backwards while he looked at the two
people before him.
Audrey relaxed and cheered for herself in her mind.
Well done! Audrey, you learned how to negotiate! She was so excited
that she nearly broke out of her Spectator state. She quickly thought
of something and asked, “Oh right, Mr. Hanged Man, did you receive
the one thousand pounds?”
“I’m sorry, I’m still sailing. I have yet to return to land.” Alger wasn’t
willing to bring it up. He answered her original question, “The
Beyonder that can go through wooden doors and foil locks would
probably be Sequence 9 Apprentice. The secret organization,
Theosophy Order, has its formula. However, don’t ignore the
possibility that it was obtained through other channels, such as an
ancient tomb of the Fourth Epoch.”
The Theosophy Order, the secret organization that has countless ties with
the Demoness Sect… Klein rubbed his chin with his ﬁnger leisurely.
Seeing that Mr. Fool didn’t refute what was said, Audrey couldn’t
help but sigh.
“If I had found the formula for Apprentice before, I might not have
opted for Spectator.”
The performance was simply outstanding!
Alger didn’t bother with Miss Justice’s remark but continued his
explanation, “There is also a Sequence potion that is entitled Arbiter.
I think you should be familiar with it, because it is the Sequence
pathway that the Augustus and Feynapotter Kingdom’s Castiya family
has. Of course, the low Sequence formulas were used as rewards in
ancient times. Some nobles might have received it before.”
The Augustus family was a royal family of the Loen Kingdom while
the Castiya family was a royal family in the Feynapotter Kingdom.
It turns out that the Augustus family are all Arbiters… Audrey was
enlightened and felt that it cleared up her suspicion.
She sighed and thought, It’s no wonder I’ve always gone along with their
arrangements, always uncomfortable, always willing to admit defeat, like
I’m never myself when I’m before them! I thought it was because I was
timid…
“The Arbiter has a convincing charm and considerable authority, as
well as outstanding combat ability that can deal with the
unexpected,” Alger described the situation simply.
Audrey nodded slowly and leaned backwards. She then spoke
elegantly, “I have no more questions.”
Alger thought and looked towards the seat of honor at the long
bronze table.
“Honorable Mr. Fool, I’d like to ask if the True Creator’s Holy
Residence that the Aurora Order advocates is the legendary Forsaken
Land of the Gods?”
Forsaken Land of the Gods? I have only seen that term once in Roselle’s
diary… It might be in the secret dockets of the Nighthawks, but it isn’t
something I can know of currently… How do you want me to answer?
Klein nearly twitched the corner of his lips.
He considered it for a while then he replied in a calm tone, “This is
not something you should know now.”
Alger felt his heart tighten, and he immediately lowered his head and
replied, “Please forgive me for overstepping my boundaries.”
Audrey wanted to ask about the Forsaken Land of the Gods but she
also gave up the thought when she heard that.
In the lofty divine hall above the gray fog, silence suddenly ﬁlled the
air.
At that moment, Audrey felt that she should say something.
“Mr. Fool, if—and I’m saying if—I have the opportunity to join
another organization, such as the Psychology Alchemists, is it
permitted?”
Klein maintained his posture of leaning backward as he said with a
chuckle, “That is no problem. My requirement is that the existence of
the Tarot Club is not to be exposed.”
“If you become a member of another organization, the materials and
information you can use for exchange will also increase.”
After saying that, he suddenly recalled that he was also a member of
another organization. He was a real Nighthawk while The Hanged
Man was most likely related to the Church of the Lord of Storms.
Would my Tarot Club be the so-called Rebels Alliance? Traitor Gathering?
Klein was drowned in deep thoughts.
“I understand now.” Audrey was excited but she immediately thought
of a question, “Mr. Fool, if I found a suitable gentleman or lady for
this gathering, could I guide them to join? How do I do that?”
Alger thought and asked, “Mr. Fool, what is the requirement to be a
member of this gathering? How do we determine?”
Ambitious, ethical, cultured, disciplined… Four words popped into
Klein’s head instantly.
He maintained his silence for a few seconds and only spoke when
Justice and Hanged Man appeared a little uneasy.
“You can inform me here of people who you ﬁnd suitable. I will
decide if they will join us. Before that, you can’t give any hint that
would cause the secret of the Tarot Club’s existence to be exposed.
You must remember, to non-Gathering members…”
Klein paused and said in a heavy voice, “You must not speak my
name without my permission.”
Chapter 115: Cheat
“You must not speak my name without my permission.”
…
Several minutes after the Gathering ended, Audrey and Alger, who
had returned to their bedroom and ship respectively, could still hear
the words of The Fool reverberating in their ears.
Their impression of the mysterious and powerful Mr. Fool was
normally relaxed, calm, and unfathomable. It was rare that he would
adopt such a stern, supercilious attitude.
Because of that, they were exceptionally alarmed. They submitted to
his wishes sincerely.
They were no strangers to words like that, but these instructions were
normally recorded within the The Revelation of Evernight or The
Book of Storms!
…
In the West Borough of Tingen City, on Daﬀodil Street.
Klein pulled open the curtains and allowed the golden sunlight to
pour into his bedroom.
He had inspected the star that previously sent out a prayer after
Justice and The Hanged Man left, but didn’t obtain any information
this time round.
Since the crimson star had the ability to store prayers, akin to
sending oﬄine messages, Klein believed that the youth who spoke
Jotun hadn’t prayed again from the last two times he entered the
world above the giant.
This made him suspect that there was no hope left for the youth’s
parents, and that the young man had chosen to give up…
With his back facing the sunlight, Klein walked to the edge of his bed
and laid down. He didn’t want to move.
He knew that he shouldn’t waste any time and head to the Divination
Club and continue the process of digesting the potion, but he didn’t
want to move. He laid silently on his bed, enjoying his rare break.
He had a full schedule from Tuesday to Friday, mysticism lessons and
practicals in the mornings, shooting and combat training in the
afternoons. He was mentally exhausted by the time evening came
around. There was no change in his morning routine on Saturday, but
he had to guard Chanis Gate in the afternoon. He would’ve stayed
underground until the dawn of Sunday.
Sunday morning was time for Klein to catch up on sleep. In the
afternoon, circumstances would determine if he went to the
Divination Club. On Monday morning, he had just returned from
Khoy University in the morning and had the Tarot Gathering in the
afternoon. He also had to think about the issue of acting as a Seer. In
other words, he had been busy the entire week, with no time to rest.
Thus, all Klein wanted to do was laze around, lying on his bed like a
loser, not doing anything except daydreaming.
No, how can a boss of a cult be so worthless. If Miss Justice and Mr.
Hanged Man caught wind of this, their impression of me would
shatter… Klein buried his face into his blanket and motivated
himself.
“I have the formula for the Clown potion, all I need to do now is fully
digest the Seer potion… I have the formula to the Clown potion, all I
need to do now is fully digest the Seer potion…”
He muttered to himself and then propped himself up.
Klein took a bronze coin from his pocket and quickly divined if it was
suitable for him to head to the club today and got an deﬁnitive
response.
“Five, four, three, two, one!”
After the countdown, he forced himself to stand up straight and
walked over to the clothes rack before picking out his suit and hat.
…
In the meeting room of the Divination Club on Howes Street.
Klein sat down in a shaded corner and sipped on his Sibe black tea as
he read the Tingen City Honest Paper. There weren’t many members
around him, just six or seven.
Just as he was laughing at the grammatical mistake used in a job
advertisement, he saw a monocled Glacis walk in with a silk top hat
in his hand. There was a blue-dressed lady in her thirties beside him.
The lady had curved eyebrows and large yet dull eyes. In her left
hand, she was carrying an Intis hat decorated with the feathers of a
black swan.
That hat is ridiculous. Wouldn’t her neck be sore wearing that? Klein
noted to himself. He looked over and massaged his glabella, as if
alleviating his fatigue.
Through his Spirit Vision, he noticed that Glacis and the lady were
both healthy, but were anxious, angry, and ﬂustered.
“Good afternoon, Glacis. That Mr. Lanevus wasn’t a trustworthy
fellow, was he?” Klein asked with a smile, remaining seated.
Glacis had asked him for a divination about investing in Lanevus’s
steel company. Glacis had obtained a negative suggestion.
But noticing his indecisiveness, Klein believed that he had taken the
risk anyway. Klein hoped the man hadn’t invested everything he had.
Thus, Klein immediately made the association and judgment when he
saw the colors of his emotions.
Glacis froze for a moment, then let out a bitter smile.
“I truly regret not listening to the suggestion you divined for me.
Heh, this is the second time I’m saying something like that, let’s
hope, no—I believe that there will not be a third time.”
He turned his head and looked at the lady with some wrinkles.
“Madam Christina, look, Mr. Moretti had already guessed our motive
for coming here without us even speaking. He is the most magical
fortune-teller I have ever seen. I’m more than willing to describe him
as a seer.”
“Good afternoon, Mr. Moretti. We have come here precisely because
of Lanevus.” Christina gave a simple bow, clearly anxious and
ﬂustered.
“Shall we head to Topaz?” Glacis was more collected. He pointed to
the door of the meeting room with his chin.
Klein laughed as he got up.
“This is the job of a fortune-teller.”
He followed the path to the empty Topaz room.
Glacis locked the wooden door and walked to his seat while sighing.
“Lanevus has gone missing. He gave the excuse of going to the
Sivellaus County to oversee the excavation and left Tingen, never to
return. We sent someone to look for him via steam locomotive and
discovered that the large-scale steel mine he spoke of only existed on
the map. Luckily for me, I recalled your advice and only invested a
third of what I initially intended to invest. Otherwise, I would have
lost my family and my life.”
Klein’s pupils were darker than usual when he looked at the two
people in front of him. He asked, a little curious, “Before making such
a major ﬁnancial decision, wouldn’t you choose a representative and
ascertain if whatever he said was true at the Hornacis mountain
range in the Sivellaus County?”
Christina responded quickly,
“Our representative was fooled, fooled by the people Lanevus
employed, the place he rented, and the land that was fenced oﬀ.”
Klein didn’t question them any further. He maintained his attitude of
a Seer and asked, “What do you wish to divine today?”
“We wish to see if this is salvageable or not,” Christina said as she
looked at Glacis.
Klein took a piece of paper and a fountain pen.
“Then let us do an astrolabe divination. I’ll ask, and you’ll answer.”
Between the questions, Klein marked out the Thunderous
constellation and the corresponding symbols of various situations
before completing the astrolabe.
He used more elements in his astrolabe than an ordinary person
would have. The method he was going to use to interpret the
astrolabe was going to bring him closer to the truth.
“Madam, Sir, you are now at a crossroad. If you don’t restrain
yourselves and succumb to your greed and anxiety, you will fall
further into the abyss, never being able to free yourselves. But if you
can be patient and wait persistently without being greedy, then there
will be an opportunity of you seeing the sunlight…” Klein said, his
tone unhurried.
“I understand.” Christina nodded. She thought for a moment before
saying, “Mr. Moretti, can you divine Lanevus’s whereabouts?”
“No, I don’t think so. The information Lanevus left behind is most
likely fake; even his name might not be real. How can I divine
anything? Unless you can give me very speciﬁc details, or an item he
carries with him all the time,” Klein replied truthfully.
Christina fell silent for a moment before pushing a one-soli note
toward Klein.
“I have heard from Glacis that you are a true seer, who is respectful
and fearful of fate and not greedy for money. You can think of the
rest as tips that I am giving to the club.”
“Thank you for your conﬁdence in me.”
She stood up and bade farewell before leaving quickly.
Not greedy for money… No, I am a materialistic man! Klein was
regretting his actions of acting as a charlatan.
Seeing Christina leave, Glacis closed the door and asked, “Is there
really no way?”
“I told you the way just now.” Klein smiled as he leaned back.
Glacis sighed. “Lanevus took oﬀ with over 10,000 pounds and his
victims totaled over a hundred people. Luckily for me, I only lost 50
pounds. Those were my savings, and I have no debt. But Miss
Christina invested 150 pounds. To her, this is not a sum that she can
bear easily.”
“Have you called the police?” Klein suddenly felt anger towards the
cheat after hearing the sum of 10,000 pounds.
One could be considered rich even in Backlund with money like that.
I don’t know if the police would enlist the help of the Nighthawks,
Mandated Punishers, or Machinery Hivemind for a simple case like this…
Klein thought, a little distracted.
Glacis nodded and said, “We’ve already made a police report. The
police are paying a lot of attention to this case. After much
discussion, we’re willing to take out a portion of the money we would
get back as a reward. One can get 10 pounds as a reward if they
manage to provide clues about Lanevus’s whereabouts. If you can
give a precise location and help the police catch Lanevus, you can get
a reward of 100 pounds!”
10 pounds for a clue? 100 pounds for catching Lanevus? Klein’s eyes
nearly sparkled after he heard that. His breathing became heavy.
He happened to be worrying about how he was going to pay the
detective in the future.
He could barely aﬀord the second phase of the payment with the
extra salary of three pounds he received this week, but if the private
investigator managed to complete his mission within the next week,
then he wouldn’t have enough to pay oﬀ whatever he promised to
pay. He would be lacking a few soli, provided that he wouldn’t need
to spend his savings elsewhere this week.
Perhaps the police will have some items belonging to Lanevus. But they
won’t be very useful if he’s already left Tingen… Klein felt a mixture of
excitement and disappointment.
In the next hour and a half, Klein got another two customers due to
Angelica’s recommendation. One was a divination for a one-year-old
toddler. Klein immediately drew the corresponding birth astrolabe
and explained it, much to the satisfaction of his customer.
The other was searching for an item. Klein used tarot reading,
coupled with dream divination, to give him a general area. This made
his customer very shocked, for he had never seen a fortune-teller that
could give him such accurate information.
Perhaps I could obtain enough funds just by doing divinations for others .
Klein, who had received some tips, put on his hat, held his cane, and
walked toward the exit of the club.
At this moment, he saw Christina enter the club once again with a
young girl wearing a sunhat beside her.
Christina saw Klein and immediately approached him. She asked
softly, “Mr. Moretti, you said that you could try divining Lanevus’s
whereabouts if there was something belonging to him?”
“That is correct.” Klein nodded.
Christina heaved a sigh of relief and asked in a serious tone, “Then is
his child something that belongs to him?”
Huh? Klein was momentarily a little lost.
Chapter 116: Lanevus's Child
Christina didn’t notice the seer’s blank look. She took a peek at
Angelica over at the reception desk, lowered her voice, and said, “I
mean Lanevus’s child.”
She extended her hand to point at the young lady with the sunhat
and said, “This is my niece, Megose. Her mother is my elder sister.
I’m very sorry and regretful that I thought Lanevus was an
outstanding young man back then, and I introduced Megose to
Lanevus, who was single. Then they became lovers.
“Megose’s parents were happy with Lanevus at ﬁrst too. They
planned to pour all their savings into the steel company after they got
engaged. Luckily, before that happened, Lanevus ran away. Their
family didn’t encounter any life-threatening losses. Unfortunately, my
sister and brother-in-law have to explain to their relatives and friends
why the engagement ceremony will be canceled, and they have to
worry about the child that Megose is bearing.
“We believe in the God of Steam and Machinery; we are not believers
of Lord of Storms. We don’t believe in chastity before marriage. We
don’t blame Megose, and even pity her. However, the existence of the
child does make things diﬃcult, especially since he has such a
father.”
He took advantage of people both ﬁnancially and sexually… Klein
looked towards Megose who was standing quietly next to her. He
then realized that the lady was quite a beauty.
She had a bright forehead, long blond hair, and a pair of big eyes just
like Christina’s. She looked depressed yet calm, and her lips were
tightly pursed together.
What an infuriating swindler, and he even got away successfully… Klein
cursed at Lanevus and said after some thought, “If it was a child that
is already born, I do have a way to divine Lanevus’s whereabouts
using the child as an aid. But unfortunately, this would require us to
wait a few months. Yes, this might be a reﬂection of the divination
result earlier. Be patient and wait persistent without being greedy,
then there will be an opportunity of seeing the sunlight.”
“A few months…” Christina mumbled to herself as she shook her
head. “No, after such a long period of time, even if we ﬁnd Lanevus,
we wouldn’t be able to get back our money…”
She looked sideways at Megose. Her voice lowered unconsciously as
she asked, “Do you have anything that Lanevus carried around
before?”
“No,” Megose answered clearly yet gently. “Would the ring he gave
me count?”
“It must be something that he carried for a very long time.” Klein
shook his head.
Christina remained silent for a while and looked at Megose when she
said, “You have to make a decision. I think keeping this child would
make your future tough and thorny. Are you going to tell him that his
father was a swindler and took away many people’s money, including
his mother’s?
“Time to head to the clinic, to the hospital. Plus, this could help us to
ﬁnd Lanevus, to get what we lost.”
Hey, isn’t such divination a little hardcore? It was not Klein’s place to
involve himself in the family matters of others. So, he could only wait
patiently by the side as he lampooned inwardly from time to time.
Megose lowered her head and looked down. She didn’t speak for
quite a while.
Then, she touched her stomach and revealed a gentle smile.
“He is diﬀerent from his father. He will be a considerate and likable
child.
“He will kick me lightly every day, telling me his mood. He will even
hum a song, whistle and use music to help me sleep…”
Klein heard and suddenly felt something amiss.
The former part of what Megose said seemed to be normal, but the
latter part was like the ravings of a madwoman.
Did she have a mental problem due to the incident? Klein raised his right
hand to his glabella. He pretended to massage it to ease his
weariness.
Just then, Megose suddenly turned around and walked towards the
door, leaving only one sentence.
“Maybe his father will come back in secret after he is born, keeping a
part of the money for his child…”
Klein never expected she would respond like that, and he was
momentarily taken aback that he forgot to activate his Spirit Vision.
Then, he watched helplessly as Megose left the club and walked
down the stairs.
Christina let out a sigh and said, “Sorry, Mr. Moretti. Sorry to bother
you, we will look for one of Lanevus’s personal items that he carried
with him all the time.”
Klein nodded indiscernibly. He watched her walk downstairs and
sighed as he shook his head.
…
The next morning, Klein entered Blackthorn Security Company,
greeted Rozanne, and asked, “Where’s today’s newspaper?”
The sweet brown-haired girl Rozanne sized him up and said, puzzled,
“Klein, you’re so weird.”
“Why?” Klein asked in reply, smiling.
Rozanne rolled her eyes and said, “You always read the newspapers
during noon break because you have mysticism lessons in the
morning. Old Neil is already waiting for you in the armory!”
“I found out earlier that there would be a case oﬀering a reward, so I
want to read the newspaper to memorize the criminal’s appearance.
Perhaps I might one day come across the person?” Klein explained
with a smile.
“Is that so?” Rozanne picked up the day’s newspapers and started
ﬂipping through them out of curiosity. “Wanted… Lanevus, right?”
Klein immediately answered, “Yes.”
“Yes.”
“… Wicked swindler! He stole about ten thousand pounds!” Rozanne
read carefully for nearly twenty seconds before cursing suddenly in
rage.
Klein shared the same feeling.
“It’s really ridiculous! Even I want to apply to take over the case!”
Rozanne continued to read and shook her head regretfully.
“The case doesn’t seem to involve supernatural factors. Even if it did,
it would be passed to Mandated Punishers under the Lord of Storms.”
Klein didn’t quite understand what Rozanne meant, but after he took
the newspaper and read it, he sighed.
“Yeah, there were so many people cheated. There must be believers
from all three major churches, and Lanevus’s steelwork company was
said to be located in the South.”
If a case was related to supernatural factors and involved only the
believer of one God, it would be passed to the corresponding team.
However, if it involved believers of the Evernight Goddess, Lord of
Storms, and the God of Steam and Machinery, it would be assigned
based on jurisdiction area. The Nighthawks controlled the Golden
Indus Borough, the North Borough, and the West Borough. The
Mandated Punishers controlled the East Borough, South Borough, and
the port, while the Machinery Hivemind troop was responsible for
the university and suburb areas.
As he ﬂipped through the newspapers, Klein memorized Lanevus’s
appearance,
He had a plump forehead, black hair, brown eyes, and a pair of
spectacles with almost round lenses. He smirked faintly, looking as
though he was mocking everyone.
Besides that pair of spectacles, Lanevus didn’t seem to have any
obvious traits, and looked really ordinary.
He chatted with Rozanne casually then passed through the partition,
in preparation to head underground.
Then, he saw the pale and cold Corpse Collector Frye and the white-
haired black-eyed author Seeka Tron exiting the entertainment room
and turning towards him.
After a simple greeting, Klein watched his two teammates leave and
discovered Dunn Smith in a black windbreaker standing by the side
of the door he opened.
“There’s a case?” Klein asked curiously.
At that time of day, there wouldn’t be two Nighthawks heading out
together for no reason.
Dunn looked over with his gray eyes. He nodded and smiled.
“There seems to be a paranormal incident in West Borough. I’ve sent
Seeka and Frye to check on it, but you don’t have to worry about
that. Until you master combat techniques, I don’t intend to send you
on any missions. I have to take responsibility for my team members.”
Captain, you are such a nice person. Besides the receding hairline and bad
memory, you are ﬂawless… Klein complimented inwardly. He asked
for conﬁrmation, “In other words, I only need to attend mysticism
classes and combat training. I don’t have to contribute anything, and
I can still get my pay?”
“This is only temporary,” Dunn conﬁrmed.
I only need to ‘attend classes’ and ‘work out’, and I’ll get an ample
paycheck. It’s great just thinking about it… Klein thought happily.
I hope there are no more coincidences! He prayed in silence.
…
The days passed by peacefully until Friday. Klein completed his
combat training and took a carriage back to Besik Street.
Outside Henry’s Private Detective Company, he looked to the left and
to the right. Conﬁrmed that no one was watching him, he put on the
gauze mask, lifted up the collar of his windbreaker, and quickly
entered the stairway.
Knocking on the door, Klein saw the middle-aged brawny man,
Detective Henry, again.
“Good afternoon, sir. One of the cases that you entrusted us with is
done.” The deep blue-eyed Detective Henry spoke with a hoarse voice
from drinking and smoking.
Klein intentionally lowered his voice and said, “Is it the information
of the man that appeared at the Evil Dragon Bar?”
The man that bought the Spectator potion’s supplementary ingredients…
“Yes.” Henry waved his smoking pipe.
Then, he didn’t say anything but look at Klein with a smile.
Klein understood what the man meant, and he took out four one-
pound notes and handed it over.
“This is the second payment.”
He paused and added, “Write me a receipt.”
His private stash of money had been reduced to less than one
pound…
“No problem.” Henry coughed. He checked the anti-counterfeiting
marks on the notes as he instructed his staﬀ to bring over pen and
paper.
Then, he beckoned to Klein for him to have a seat while he quickly
wrote a receipt and stamped a seal on the bottom.
After completing everything, Henry took a puﬀ at his pipe and said,
“According to your description, my assistant and I waited at the Evil
Dragon Bar for three days before ﬁnally meeting that man.
“He’s quite an alert gentleman, and is good at observation.
Thankfully, we’re experienced…
“His name is Daxter Guderian, a doctor of the Greenhill Mental
Asylum.”
Chapter 117: Contact
Daxter Guderian, a doctor of the Greenhill Mental Asylum…
Klein silently repeated what the detective had said and started to
think about the ways he could interact with this doctor whom he
suspected to be a Spectator from the Psychology Alchemists.
He didn’t want to take too much of a risk on this matter. He didn’t
want the Nighthawks to discover that he was problematic. He didn’t
want to lose the life he had now over a mere exchange of information
and resources.
Furthermore, this person was most probably a Spectator. Anyone who
hadn’t undergone special training wouldn’t be able to hide their
motives and thoughts from a person like that.
I’ll get a proxy, making me appear a little more mysterious? No, the more
people involved, the easier it is for there to be problems… Yes… perhaps I
can hide the truth within the truth. I’ll let that doctor know of my thoughts
and feelings through my expression and body language, but not the whole
truth…
As Detective Henry described Daxter Guderian, Klein thought about
what methods he could use to minimize risk without aﬀecting the
results he wanted.
Slowly, he found inspiration in a detective ﬁlm he had once seen.
Well, I can try that, but I’ll have to practice it repeatedly… Klein nodded
inwardly before directing his full concentration on what Detective
Henry had to say.
Cough… Henry cleared his throat and said, “We are still working on
the request involving the red chimney. You should know that there
are many buildings in Tingen that have similar characteristics. Of
course, it would be much easier if you could provide us with more
clues.”
Klein laughed dryly.
“I wouldn’t have had to make the request if I had more clues.”
Honestly, this long investigation had depressed him, for the person
behind the scenes had obviously noticed Klein’s divinations and had
more than enough time to ﬁnd another hideout.
Thus, all he could do was hope that he could ﬁnd relevant clues from
the information of the tenants.
And that alone cost seven pounds… Just the thought of it made him
feel the pinch… Klein grabbed his cane and left after Detective Henry
ﬁnished his report.
…
At twenty minutes to nine on a Saturday morning, in an oﬃce of the
Greenhill Mental Asylum.
Daxter Guderian, who was wearing gold-rimmed spectacles, removed
his jacket and hat and hung them on the clothes rack.
He had just picked up his tin of coﬀee powder when he heard
knocking on the door.
“Please come in,” Daxter said casually.
The half-closed door opened, and a young man wearing a black
windbreaker entered.
Daxter didn’t recognize the person that walked in, so he asked,
puzzled, “Good morning, you are?”
Klein closed the door, took oﬀ his hat, and pressed it against his chest
before bowing.
“Good morning, Doctor Daxter, please forgive me for taking the
liberty to visit without any warning. I am Probationary Inspector
Klein Moretti of the Awwa Police Department. These are my
identiﬁcation documents and badge.”
“Inspector?” Daxter muttered softly as he received Klein’s
identiﬁcation documents and badge.
“Special Operations Department…” He looked up slowly, his eyes
calm, as if he was scrutinizing something.
Short black hair, pupils slightly darker than brown, a scholarly aura, no
ill intent at the moment…
Daxter returned the items and pointed to the chair on the other side
of the table.
“Please have a seat, Oﬃcer. How might I assist you?”
Klein sat down and placed his cane to the side. He slowly put away
his documents and badge, then smiled.
“Please allow me to reintroduce myself.
“I am also a member of Tingen City’s Nighthawks Squad, specializing
in dealing with incidents involving the supernatural.
“Good morning, Mr. Spectator.”
Before he ﬁnished his sentence, he wasn’t surprised to see Daxter’s
pupils constrict. Daxter retracted his hand, looking like he was about
to escape.
“Oﬃcer, I don’t understand what you mean.” Daxter forced out a few
words, almost unable to maintain his form. “I don’t like jokes like
this. Perhaps I should call security.”
Klein slowly took out his revolver from his armpit holster, his smile
unchanging.
“Mr. Daxter, I know that you can see my conﬁdence and that I do not
have any ill intent. Heh heh, honestly speaking, I wasn’t too sure
myself, but your reaction gave me the answer I needed.”
Every sentence I said just now is true… Klein added in his heart.
Daxter relaxed slightly, his gaze shooting toward the revolver. He
asked, confused, “I ﬁnd it hard to understand why you came looking
for me… I don’t think that I revealed anything…”
Klein laughed and replied, “It was just a coincidence, or perhaps fate
wanted us to meet.
“We ran into each other once in the underground market at Evil
Dragon Bar, but you didn’t notice me back then.
“You were smart to purchase the supplementary ingredients for the
potion ﬁrst, but since I am familiar with that formula, you caught my
attention.”
Daxter suddenly exhaled, as if he just lost the motivation to defend
himself.
“I see…
“I thought I was careful enough, to think that, to think that…”
After muttering to himself, he looked into Klein’s eyes and said,
“Oﬃcer, I know that you’re not here to arrest me. What is your true
motive for being here?”
With a relaxed expression, Klein said, “I am diﬀerent from the other
Nighthawks. I don’t believe that Beyonders not within our ranks are
criminals in the making. This is not fair to those who adhere to the
law.”
Daxter changed his posture. He loosened up and said, “The world
would be at peace if the other Nighthawks, Mandated Punishers, and
Machinery Hivemind acted like you.”
“You know of other members from the Nighthawks, Mandated
Punishers, and Machinery Hivemind?” Klein feigned surprise. “This is
not something a person who became a Beyonder by mistake should
know. There must be an organization behind you.”
He leaned back and said with a smile, “Psychology Alchemists?”
He casually watched Daxter’s expression contort as he said those
words.
“I could see that you were anticipating my answer, yet I still missed
the bait and fell into your linguistic trap…” Daxter said in frustration.
He started to notice that the Spectator state wasn’t omnipotent. He
could tell why the other party was here, but it didn’t mean he
understood the speciﬁcs.
Klein stroked the cylinder of his revolver and said, “Doctor, we need
to have an honest conversation. That can start with me.
“I don’t believe that Beyonders not under management are potential
criminals, but I agree that every Beyonder must be registered and
monitored. This is a precaution against the risk of Beyonders losing
control. It’s to avoid the occurrence of something even more
dangerous.
“I won’t disrupt your normal life, but I hope that there can be limited
cooperation between us.”
“Limited cooperation?” Daxter asked, as if thinking about something.
Klein let out a soft chuckle.
“Yes, limited.
“For example, tell me about your condition regularly. You should
know that it is possible to save someone who has not completely lost
control yet, and the Nighthawks have considerable experience in this
regard.
“Or, if you could give me clues of a Beyonder you know, or a
Beyonder in your organization who is about to do something that can
endanger the innocent.
“Or, if you would like to exchange something for items that you
could make more use of. This is a perk I am giving you. You should
know what perks mean.
“Also, you need not worry about being suddenly prosecuted by
members of the Nighthawks, Mandated Punishers, or Machinery
Hivemind one day. You can live your life in joy and stability.
“We will give you something you can use to prove your identity. You
can use it when you have no other options left.”
Daxter listened on silently. It was a while before he said, “You want
me to betray my organization?”
“No, not betray,” Klein said sincerely. “This is the protection of
justice, morals, and kindness. You are stopping something evil,
merciless, and bloody. Other than that, I wouldn’t ask you to betray
the secrets of the organization you are in.”
Daxter thought for a moment, as if feeling better now that there was
an excuse.
He was silent for a few seconds before he extended his right hand.
“Here’s to a successful cooperation.”
Klein shook his hand with his free hand and said, “A successful
cooperation.”
He paused for a moment before chuckling.
“Doctor, can you now tell me if you are a member of the Psychology
Alchemists?”
“Yes.” Daxter nodded.
Klein, who hadn’t deactivated his Spirit Vision since he entered,
didn’t see any changes in the colors of his emotions. Thus he asked
discreetly, “How did you join the Psychology Alchemists?”
Daxter looked into his eyes and said, “I discovered that there was a
patient of this asylum who could see right through me when I was
tending to him. His clear mind was nothing like a lunatic…
“His name is Hood Eugen.”
Klein committed the name to memory and chatted with Daxter a little
longer, deciding on a secret way to communicate and meet up.
He didn’t exchange matters regarding potions, formulas, and rumors
for the time being. At an appropriate moment, he bade farewell and
put away his revolver before leaving Daxter’s oﬃce.
Daxter exhaled after he saw Klein’s back disappear from his ﬁeld of
vision. He slumped into his chair, feeling a little agonized and little
relaxed.
…
36 Zouteland Street. Inside Blackthorn Security Company.
Seated behind his desk, Dunn swept the area with his gray eyes and
asked, “What happened?”
Klein, who was late by about half an hour, organized his thoughts
and said, “Captain, I found a Beyonder and conﬁrmed that he is a
member of the Psychology Alchemists.
“He’s an orthodox doctor and is willing to cooperate with us. I think
it’s best to maintain the status quo. He could help us learn more
about the current condition of the Association of Psychological
Alchemy.”
After pausing for a few seconds, Klein added, “I want to develop him
into an informant for the Nighthawks, or a hidden external member.”
The word ‘informant’ came from the Intis language. It was created by
the Emperor Roselle.
Dunn nodded slowly and said, “You handled the situation well, but it
would be best to inform me when you face such a situation in the
future.
“Give me that doctor’s information and a written account of the way
you handled the situation. I will give him something he can use to
prove his identity.
“Also, don’t speak of this to Leonard and the rest. Even though they
are trustworthy teammates, the protocol clearly requires us to keep
this close.
“You will be in charge of contacting that doctor in the future.”
Klein exhaled silently and replied with a smile, “Alright.”
Chapter 118: August
Time ﬂew by and Tingen bade farewell to the end of summer. The
temperature hovered between twenty-six and twenty-seven degrees
Celsius.
Whoosh!
Klein stood up from the bathtub and took a stride forward, sending
water droplets to the ﬂoor.
He stood there naked, looking down at his abs. He ﬂexed and saw
prominent muscle lines appear.
That was the result of his daily training. Besides, he appeared a lot
more energetic.
And just today, his combat teacher, Gawain had started teaching him
the basic footwork for punching and the techniques for delivering
force.
Tap. Tap. Tap. Klein stepped on the ﬂoor barefooted in the bathroom,
either sliding forward or retreating before dodging to the right and
swinging his ﬁst while he made a defensive gesture.
Phew. He stopped and let out a breath happily. He took the towel
next to him and wiped himself down.
After getting in touch with Daxter Guderian, the doctor in the mental
asylum, Klein seemed to escape from coincidences for two whole
weeks. Without the constant barrage of supernatural incidents, his
life became stable. He received his paycheck on time, researched
mysticism in-depth, trained his marksmanship and ﬁghting skills,
developed new cooking recipes, slowly gathered decent utensils and
decorations with Benson and Melissa, asked his teammates about
supernatural cases in the past, divined for people who came to the
club, and strictly followed the principles he ﬁgured out.
That made him more stable. If it wasn’t for the late nights in which
he still missed Earth, the red chimney that had yet to be uncovered,
or the Misfortune Cloth Puppet’s picture that still appeared in his
dreams occasionally, he would’ve started getting used to his current
life and think of it aﬀectionately.
During that time, three Tarot Club Gatherings were convened, but
Klein didn’t receive any new pages of Roselle’s diary. However,
according to Justice’s explanation, she had gotten to know two
Beyonders and she was getting in touch with them consistently.
When she got into their circle of acquaintances, it was likely that she
could trade for more pages of Roselle’s diary.
The Hanged Man also expressed that he had returned to land and was
dealing with some matters. He would begin looking for more as soon
as he had more free time.
Besides, Justice felt that the two Beyonders whom she knew were
potential targets to join the Gathering. They both had decent
identities as cover, with certain but diﬀerent channels of information,
as well as principles and unique characteristics. They were not the
kind of people that would sell out a secret. The only problem was
that they were only Sequence 9 Beyonders, which wasn’t too suitable
for a high-end secret organization like the Tarot Club.
High-end secret organization? Sounds more like a pyramid scheme…
Klein only let out a heavy sigh to cover up the fact that he was at a
loss for words to reply to Miss Justice’s complacency. He could only
agree to observe the two Beyonders further.
Of course, Justice wasn’t the innocent and romantic maiden from
before. She kept her guard up and never mentioned the names and
traits of the two Beyonders. She was afraid that The Hanged Man
would be able to identify her through that.
Miss Justice said that she clearly feels the signs of the potion digesting. She
might need another three to four weeks until she completes her acting as a
Spectator. My scheduled acquisition of the Telepathist formula has to be
brought forward… Klein threw aside the towel that he used to dry
himself and put on his clothes as he thought about the Tarot Club
from the day before.
In the last twenty days, he had only met Daxter Guderian once. He
had the idea of haste makes waste, so he merely chatted about the
doctor’s state and asked unimportant matters about the Psychology
Alchemists.
Given the speed with which Justice was digesting the potion, he had
no choice but to begin thinking about how to get the formula of
Sequence 8 Telepathist from Daxter earlier.
Klein buttoned his shirt and took another dry towel to wrap around
his head to absorb the water in his hair.
Compared to Justice, he was digesting the Seer potion even faster
than expected. By this week, the sounds that he shouldn’t hear and
things that he shouldn’t see had already vanished while engaging in
Cogitation or Spirit Vision.
Flipping over the towel, Klein dried his hair again. He lifted his head
to look at the door and muttered to himself, “The Seer principles that
I’ve ﬁgured out are really eﬃcient. Next week… I should be able to
digest the potion entirely by next week. I have no idea where to get
the single horn of a matured Hornacis gray mountain goat and a
complete stalk of a human-faced rose required by the Clown
formula… Maybe I could do as Lady Daly did and send in a special
application? But that would deﬁnitely attract the attention of the
higher-ups, and I want to develop at my own pace. The believer from
the Aurora Order in the police department was found too, but I have
yet to ﬁnd out who this Mr. Z is…
“Henry said that he would complete the red chimney task before the
end of this week. My private stash of money has returned to slightly
more than seven pounds, so at least I don’t have to worry about
making the ﬁnal payment…
“Some of the information on houses and tenants that he provided
before didn’t seem to have any abnormalities, but I have no time to
investigate them one by one…
“Perhaps I could see which red chimney houses have gotten new
tenants recently?
“Hmm, that’s one way to look at it.”
…
Sitting silently for another half a minute, he put on his black trousers,
bow tie, and armpit holster. He then picked up his sweaty knight
training suit from the ﬂoor and tossed it into the laundry basket. He
opened the door and exited the bathroom. He had just ﬁnished his
Wednesday afternoon combat training, and he was still at his teacher
Gawain’s place.
“Hello, Mr. Moretti.” Gawain’s maidservant happened to pass by, and
she quickly bowed.
Klein nodded slightly and pointed at the messy bathroom.
“Could you clean this up, please?”
“Of course, sir. The clothes will be taken care of by the laundry maid.
She’ll come over at six.” The maidservant held her head low when
she answered.
Laundry maids had no accommodation or food included, so they
weren’t hired by only one household. They were normally contracted
to handle the laundry from several households. Either they rushed
around daily, washing one household’s clothes before going to the
next, or they would gather all the clothes from diﬀerent households
and take care of it all at the same time, before sending it all back.
Only then could they barely make a living.
Klein didn’t say much but returned to the living room to bid farewell
to the owner who was sitting on the rocking chair.
He saw Gawain nodding lethargically, a light brown blanket covering
his legs and the Awwa Evening News in his hands.
Klein knew for a fact that the gentleman bathing in the setting sun’s
glow was in his early ﬁfties, but his listlessness made him seem like
he was already in his eighties.
During combat training, Gawain maintained silence and only give
pointers when he needed to. He wasn’t one for casual chatting. Klein
was so exhausted from the daily training that he had no intention of
trying to engage in conversation. Thus, their relationship remained
distant.
From his demonstrations, Teacher Gawain’s strength is still quite
terrifying, and his steps are swift too. I reckon it wouldn’t be a problem for
him to ﬁght three of me… He has the pay from the police station, and he
also bought a plot of land in a village out in the Tingen suburbs that
provides a ﬁxed rental… He hires a chef, a maidservant, and a laundry
maiden… In the Foodaholic Empire on Earth, a man in his ﬁfties with
such wealth would have been traveling the world…
Klein looked away from Gawain and shook his head. Then, he went
to the clothes rack to take down his top hat and black windbreaker.
After he tidied himself up, he took his cane and exited the house. He
walked along the weed-covered stone path towards the gates.
Just then, he saw that there was a two-wheeled carriage stopped
outside the metal fence, and there was a man with a familiar face
standing next to it.
“Leonard?” Klein muttered, looking suspiciously towards his messy-
haired Nighthawks teammate.
Leonard was dressed in a white shirt, black trousers, and buttonless
leather boots as he twirled his hat in his hands. When he saw Klein
come out from the house, he smiled and asked, “Are you pleasantly
surprised?”
Only surprise, without any joy… Klein ignored Leonard’s inappropriate
behavior and looked into the fake poet’s green eyes.
“What happened?”
Leonard put on his hat and said, “Captain wants you to work with me
and Frye. Let’s talk about it on the way.”
“Alright.” Klein followed him into the carriage.
As the scene outside of the carriage ﬂew past, Leonard took up the
document bag by his side and threw it at Klein.
Klein caught it steadily and took out a document. He then started
reading carefully.
“August 11th, 11pm, at a workhouse in West Borough, the bankrupt
Salus attempted arson to cause a tragedy. But in the end, he only
managed to burn himself to death…”
“August 11th, 10pm, harbor worker, Zid jumped into the Tussock
River and ended his poverty-stricken life…”
“August 11th, 8pm, in Iron Cross Street’s Lower Street, Mrs. Lauwis
who earned a living by selling matchboxes died of a sudden
disease…”
…
Klein was puzzled when he read the ﬁrst two incidents. He found the
deaths very ordinary and common. Not only should it have been
beneath the attention of the Nighthawks, even the police force would
avoid wasting resources looking into such obvious causes of death.
However, when he read down the list, he slowly creased his
eyebrows.
After two pages, he suddenly lifted his head and looked at Leonard.
“Isn’t this too many?”
When the number of ordinary deaths reached a staggering amount, it
was diﬃcult to call it normal.
For once, Leonard nodded seriously and said, “The number of death
incidents within the past two weeks are ﬁve times the normal rate.
“When the Tingen Police headquarters tabulated the data, they
realized the problem and quickly passed it over to us, as well as the
Mandated Punishers and the Machinery Hivemind.
“Although these death incidents appeared normal during initial
investigations, Captain believes we should investigate them once
more. It might require the help of divination or ritualistic magic.”
Klein said with a look of enlightenment, “I understand.”
Leonard snapped his ﬁngers and said, “You, me, and Frye are in a
team. He’s waiting for us at Iron Cross Street’s Lower Street. Seeka,
Royale, and Old Neil are in another team, investigating
corresponding incidents in the North Borough. Captain is staying in
the security company to respond to any emergencies.”
“Okay.” Klein nodded solemnly and suddenly thought of something.
He quickly asked, “Can I drop by my place and leave a note?”
He had to tell his brother and sister that he couldn’t dine at home
that night because something has cropped up.
Leonard laughed.
“No problem, it’s on the way.”
With that, Klein calmed down and read over the death incidents
again, intending to ﬁnd a link among the various names, times, and
causes of death.
Then, he suddenly realized something.
Is this my ﬁrst group mission after becoming a Nighthawk?
Chapter 119: The True Lower
Street
Tingen City, 2 Daﬀodil Street.
Klein, who had left a note, locked the door and walked briskly
towards Leonard Mitchell who was waiting by the side of the road.
Leonard’s short black hair had grown a little over the month, and the
lack of any grooming made it look messy.
Despite that, his messy hair still complimented his decent looks,
emerald-colored eyes, and poetic vibes. It exuded a diﬀerent sense of
beauty.
Indeed, any hairstyle depends on the face… Klein lampooned inwardly.
He pointed in the direction of Iron Cross Street and asked, “Is Frye
waiting for us there?”
“Yes.” Leonard smoothed his untucked shirt and said casually, “Did
you notice any clues when you were looking at the documents?”
Klein held his cane in his left hand as he walked along the side of the
road and said, “No, I cannot ﬁnd anything common in their times,
locations, or causes of death. You should know that any rituals
involving evil gods or devils must be conducted within a certain time
frame or using a special method.”
Leonard touched the custom-made revolver hidden underneath his
shirt, by his waist and chuckled.
“That isn’t an absolute rule. In my experience, some evil gods or
devils are easily satisﬁed, as long as they have a particular interest in
what is being asked of them.
“Also, a good number of the deaths seem normal. We have to omit
them before we can arrive at the real answer.”
Klein glanced at him and said, “That’s why the Captain asked us to
investigate once more. To eliminate the normal incidents.”
“Leonard, your tone and description tell me that you have
considerable experience in this area, but you have only been a
member of the Nighthawks for four years, with an average of two
supernatural incidents a month. Furthermore, a large number of
those were simple and easy to solve.”
He always felt that Leonard Mitchell was a little weird and
mysterious. Not only was he always suspicious of him, believing that
there was something about him. In addition, his demeanor also
changed from time to time, sometimes quiet, sometimes arrogant,
sometimes ﬂippant, sometimes staid.
“Could it be that you’ve also had a fortuitous encounter? An
encounter that makes you view yourself as a star in a play?” Klein
made a rough deduction based on all the movies, novels, and dramas
he had watched in the past.
Upon hearing this question, Leonard laughed and said, “That’s
because you’re not a full-ﬂedged Nighthawk yet. You’re still in the
training phase.
“The Holy Cathedral compiles a record of all supernatural encounters
experienced by cathedrals of the diﬀerent dioceses and hands it down
to its members once every six months.
“Aside from your mysticism lessons, you can submit an application to
the Captain and request to enter Chanis Gate to read these records.”
Klein nodded in enlightenment.
“The Captain has never mentioned this to me.”
Klein hadn’t had the opportunity to enter Chanis Gate up to this
point.
Leonard chuckled and said, “I thought that you were already used to
the Captain’s style. To think that you are still naively waiting for him
to remind you…”
Upon saying that, he added meaningfully, “We must be cautious of
the Captain if there ever comes a day when he remembers
everything.”
Would that mean a loss of control? Klein nodded, his expression
serious. He then asked, “Is the forgetfulness unique to the Captain? I
had thought that it was a problem brought about by the Sleepless
Sequence.”
Burning the midnight oil usually leads to memory loss…
“More accurately, it’s a symptom unique to a Nightmare. With
dreams and reality intertwined, it’s often hard for a person to
diﬀerentiate between what is real and what isn’t. They need to
remember what isn’t part of reality…” Leonard wanted to elaborate
further, but they had already arrived at Iron Cross Street and found
Corpse Collector Frye waiting for them at the public carriage station.
Frye was wearing a round black hat and a windbreaker of a similar
color with a leather briefcase in his hand. He was so pale that it made
Klein suspect if he would soon collapse at anytime. His icy aura made
everyone else waiting for the carriage keep their distance from him.
After nodding to each other, the three grouped up silently and
walked past the Smyrin Bakery before turning onto the Lower Street
of Iron Cross Street.
They were immediately faced with a din. Merchants selling clam
soup, seared ﬁsh, ginger beer, and fruits were shouting hysterically
for attention, causing the pedestrians to involuntarily slow down.
It was already a little past ﬁve. People were returning to Iron Cross
Street, and the sides of the streets were becoming crowded. Some
children were mixed in the crowd, coldly watching everything,
placing their attention on the pockets of the pedestrians.
Klein frequently came here for cheap cooked food and was familiar
with the streets, especially since he had lived in a nearby apartment
in the past. He reminded the group, “Be careful of thieves.”
Leonard smiled. “You need not mind them.”
He pulled on his shirt and adjusted the holster of his gun, revealing
his revolver.
Suddenly, all the gazes ﬁxed on them shifted away. The pedestrians
around them instinctively made way.
Klein froze for a moment, then caught up to Leonard and Frye with
large steps. He lowered his head, trying hard to avoid being noticed
by anyone he knew.
Benson and Melissa still had dealings with the neighbors here. After
all, they hadn’t moved too far away.
The three made their way past the area that was had many peddlers
and turned into the true Lower Street of Iron Cross Street.
The pedestrians here were all dressed in old, ragged clothes. They
were cautious of strangers wearing bright and beautiful clothes; yet,
there was also greed in their eyes, like vultures eyeing a meal,
waiting to strike at any time. But Leonard’s revolver prevented any
accidents from happening.
“Let’s ﬁrst investigate the death from yesterday. We’ll begin with
Mrs. Lauwis, a lady who glued matchboxes together for a living.”
Leonard ﬂipped his notes and pointed to a place not far away, “First
ﬂoor, No. 134…”
As the three of them walked forward, children who were playing in
the streets and dressed in shabby clothes quickly hid by the corner of
the road. They observed them with eyes full of curiosity and fear.
“Look at their arms and legs, thin as matchsticks.” Leonard sighed.
He entered building No. 134 ﬁrst.
Air that was a mixture of numerous scents entered Klein’s nostrils. He
could faintly detect the stench of urine, sweat, and mold, as well as
the smell of burning coal.
Klein couldn’t help but pinch his nose. He then saw Bitsch
Mountbatten who had been waiting there for them.
Oﬃcer Mountbatten had a brownish-yellow mustache and was
envious of Leonard’s rank of inspector.
“Sir, I have already asked Lauwis to wait in her room,” Bitsch
Mountbatten said with his unique, shrill voice.
He clearly didn’t recognize Klein, who now looked more energized
and proper. All he cared about was sucking up to the three oﬃcers in
front of him as he led them to the Lauwis family on the ﬁrst ﬂoor.
It was a simple apartment. There was a bunk bed laid upright inside
the room and a desk ﬁlled with glue and hard paper on the right side.
The corner of the room was piled full of frames for matchboxes,
while an old cabinet sat on the left, acting as a storage space for both
clothes and cutlery.
A stove, toilet, and a small amount of coal and timber occupied the
two sides of the door, while the center of the room was occupied by
two dirty mattresses. A man was sleeping under a torn blanket,
leaving no space for anyone to walk.
A lady lay on the lower level of the bunk bed, her skin ice cold. It
was clear that she had lost all signs of life.
Beside the corpse sat a man in his thirties. He had oily hair, looked
dispirited, and his eyes had lost their luster.
“Lauwis, these three oﬃcers are here to examine the body and ask
you questions,” Bitsch Mountbatten shouted, without any regard for
the sleeping man.
The dispirited man looked up weakly and asked in surprise, “Didn’t
someone already examine the corpse and question me?”
He was dressed in a grayish-blue worker’s uniform which had visible
signs of being mended multiple times.
“Answer when I tell you to! Why do you have so many questions?”
Bitsch Mountbatten berated the man, then turned to Leonard, Klein,
and Frye. “Oﬃcers, this is Lauwis. The person on the bed is his wife,
who is also the deceased. According to our preliminary analysis, she
died from a sudden illness.”
Klein and the rest tiptoed to the edge of the bed.
The high-nosed, thin-lipped Frye did not say anything with his cold
demeanor. Instead, he patted Lauwis gently, signaling for the man to
make way so that he could examine the body.
Klein looked at the sleeping man and asked, “This is?”
“M-my tenant.” Lauwis rubbed his forehead as he said, “The rent for
this room is three soli ten pence a week. I’m only a worker at the
harbor, and my wife made two and a quarter pence per crate of glued
matchboxes. Each crate h-has, up to 130 boxes. We, we also have a
child. We can only rent the rest of the space to someone else. We
only charge a soli a week for the mattress…”
“I have a tenant who’s helping out at the theater, and he’s not back
before 10 at night. He sold his rights to the mattress in the daytime to
t-this man. He’s the person who watches over the gate of the theater
at night, so he only pays six pence every week…”
Hearing the other party stammer as he explained, Klein couldn’t help
but look at the crate in the corner of the room.
One crate had 130 matchboxes and only earned them 2.25 pence, about
the cost of two pounds of black bread… How many crates could she
manage a day 1 ?
Leonard surveyed the surroundings and asked, “Was your wife acting
abnormally prior to her death?”
Lauwis, who had been asked similar questions, pointed to the left
side of his left chest and said, “From last week, well—perhaps the
week before, she said that she felt stuﬀy in this area and couldn’t
catch her breath.”
The precursor to a heart condition? A normal death? Klein interrupted,
“Did you see how she died?”
Lauwis recalled, “She stopped working after sunset. Candles and gas
are more expensive than matchboxes… She said that she was very
tired and asked me to talk to the kids and let her rest. When I saw her
again, she had a-already stopped breathing.”
Lauwis could no longer hide his grief and pain when he said that.
Klein and Leonard asked several questions, but could not ﬁnd
anything unnatural about the death.
After they looked at each other, Leonard said, “Mr. Lauwis, please
wait outside for a few minutes. We are going to conduct a thorough
examination of the corpse. I don’t think that you’ll want to see that.”
“Alright.” Lauwis stood up anxiously.
Bitsch Mountbatten walked toward the mattress and kicked the
tenant, violently chasing him out of the apartment. He then closed
the door and guarded the room from the outside.
“So?” Leonard looked at Frye.
“She died of a heart attack,” Frye said with certainty, retracting his
hands.
Klein thought for a moment before taking out a half-penny, intending
to do a quick judgment.
“Mrs. Lauwis’s heart attack was due to supernatural causes?” No, that is
too narrow, the answer might be misleading… Hmm, “There are
supernatural factors inﬂuencing Mrs Lauwis’s death.” I’ll use that! He
quickly decided on a statement.
As he recited the statement, Klein made his way to the side of Mrs
Lauwis’s corpse. His eyes turned darker as he tossed the coin.
The sound of the coin reverberated around the room as it fell,
straight into Klein’s palm.
This time, the portrait of the king was facing up.
This meant that there were supernatural factors inﬂuencing Mrs.
Lauwis’s death!
Chapter 120: Workhouse
“There is the presence of supernatural factors…” Klein’s eyes
returned to normal, and he looked at Leonard and Frye.
Leonard suddenly chuckled.
“Very professional, and deserving of the title of Seer.”
Are you trying to hint at something… Klein muttered in his head.
Frye opened his suitcase and took out a silver knife and other tools.
He paused and asked, “The corpse tells me that she really died of a
sudden heart attack. Do you have any way to divine a more detailed
answer?”
Klein nodded seriously and said, “I can attempt to combine a
mediumship ritual and a dream divination. Hopefully, I’ll be able to
obtain something from Mrs. Lauwis’s remaining spirituality.”
Frye maintained his cold and reserved state. He took two steps back
and said, “Give it a try.”
He turned his head sideways and looked at Klein. He suddenly sighed
without much ﬂuctuation in his tone. “You’re getting more and more
used to this kind of situation.”
It’s not like I wanted it… Klein had an urge to cry. He then took out
the bottles of pure dew, essential oils, and herbal powder. Then, he
quickly set up the mediumship ritual.
He chanted the honored titles of the Evernight Goddess in the middle
of the spirituality wall and recited his prayers in Hermes.
Soon, wind spun around him and the light grew dimmer.
Klein’s eyes turned entirely black, and he repeated the divination
statement, “The cause of Mrs. Lauwis’s death.
“The cause of Mrs. Lauwis’s death.”
…
He entered the dreamland whilst standing and ‘saw’ a translucent
spirit lingering around the corpse.
Then, he extended his illusory right hand to touch Mrs. Lauwis’s
remaining spirituality.
In an instance, light burst out in front of him as scenes ﬂashed past,
one after another.
There was a skinny and sallow lady dressed in ragged clothes, busily
making matchboxes.
She suddenly paused and held her chest.
She was speaking to her two children.
Her body wavered as she gasped for air.
She was buying black bread when someone suddenly patted her.
She was having the symptoms of a heart attack again and again.
She was feeling weary and got into bed, but she never woke up ever
again.
Klein observed every single detail, intending to look for a trace of the
supernatural factor. But when everything ended, he still hadn’t
gained any clues. As the blurriness shattered, Klein left the
dreamland and returned to reality.
He dispelled the wall of spirituality and said to the waiting Frye and
amused Leonard,
“There were no direct symptoms. Most of the scenes revealed that
Mrs. Lauwis had a heart ailment a long time ago. The only scene that
was diﬀerent was when Mrs. Lauwis was patted on the back by
someone. The hand was fair and slender, apparently a woman’s.”
“For such a family, they wouldn’t go to a doctor unless they’re very,
very sick. Even if they were to queue at a free charity hospital, time
is not something they can aﬀord to lose. A day without work might
mean no food on the table the next day.” Leonard sighed emotionally
like a poet.
Frye looked at the corpse on the bed and sighed lightly.
Before Klein spoke, Leonard quickly got out of his pensive state and
said thoughtfully, “Are you implying that the supernatural factor
came into play when Mrs. Lauwis was patted? It came from the
slender hand of a lady or madam?”
Klein nodded and replied, “Yes, but this is merely my interpretation.
Divination is always unclear.”
The conversation ended. He and Leonard stepped back to the other
side of the bed and allowed Frye to take out his tools from his
suitcase without any disturbance, so he could do a further
examination.
After Frye was done, they waited as he packed up his tools. After
cleaning up and covering the corpse, he turned around and said, “Her
death was caused by a natural heart disease. There’s no doubt about
it.”
Upon hearing the conclusion, Leonard paced back and forth. He even
walked to the side of the door, paused for quite a while before
saying, “That’s it for now. Let’s head over to the workhouse in West
Borough. We’ll see if we can ﬁnd other clues. Maybe we can link the
two incidents together.”
“Okay, we can only hope,” Klein agreed, still ﬁlled with puzzlement.
Frye picked up his suitcase and while skipping and walking, he
carefully went across the two ﬂoor mattresses without stepping on
anyone’s blanket.
Leonard opened the door and walked out of the room ﬁrst. He told
Lauwis and the tenant, “You can return home now.”
Klein thought for a moment before adding, “Don’t be in a hurry to
bury the body. Wait for another day, as there might be one more
thorough examination.”
“A-alright, Oﬃcer.” Lauwis bowed lightly and replied in a hurry.
Then, feeling numbed and lost, he said, “A-actually, I… I don’t have
the money to bury her just yet. I have to save for another few days,
just a few more days. Luckily, the weather is turning cold.”
Klein was shocked and asked, “You plan on letting the corpse remain
in the room for a few days?”
Lauwis forced a smile and replied, “Yea, thankfully, the weather
became colder recently. I can move the body onto the table at night.
When we eat, I can carry her to the bed…”
Before he ﬁnished what he had to say, Frye suddenly interrupted,
“I’ve left you money for the burial next to your wife.”
After saying those words in absolute calmness, he exited the
apartment directly, unbothered by Lauwis’s shocked expression and
gratitude that followed.
Klein followed closely and thought of a question.
If the weather was still as hot as June or July, how would Lauwis deal
with his wife’s corpse?
Pick a very dark night with strong winds, throw the corpse into the
Tussock River or the Khoy River? Or just dig a hole and bury her?
Klein knew that the law requiring a cemetery burial had been
established more than a thousand years ago, at the end of the
previous Epoch. The seven major churches and imperial households
from each country had approved the law in order to cut down on the
number of water ghosts, zombies, and restless wraiths.
Each country provided free land, while each church was in charge of
keeping watch and patrolling. They only charged minimum fees for
cremation and burial in order to pay for the necessary labor force.
But even so, the truly poor still couldn’t aﬀord it.
After leaving 134 Iron Cross Street at Lower Street, the three
Nighthawks and Bitsch Mountbatten parted ways. Silently, they took
a turn to the nearby workhouse in West Borough.
As they got closer, Klein saw a long queue. It was just like when the
people from the Foodaholic Empire on earth queued for a shop that
gone viral on the Internet. The place was packed.
“There’s about a hundred, no, closer to two hundred,” he muttered in
surprised. He saw the people queuing were in tattered clothes with
numb expressions. They only occasionally looked towards the door of
the workhouse impatiently.
Frye slowed down and said coldly, “There is a limit to the number of
homeless poor each workhouse will accept daily. They can only take
them in based on the queue order. Of course, the workhouse will
examine and refuse entry to those who fail to meet the criteria.”
“The economic recession in the recent months has played a part
too…” Leonard sighed.
“Those who don’t manage to queue will have to ﬁgure out a way of
their own?” Klein asked subconsciously.
“They can also try their luck in the other workhouses. Diﬀerent
workhouses have diﬀerent operating hours. However, each one has
the same long line. Some of them would wait from two in the
afternoon.” Frye paused. “The rest of the people mostly starve for a
day. Then, they lose their ability to ﬁnd a job and fall into a vicious
cycle that leads directly to death. Those who can’t withstand the
hardship end up losing their struggle to stay on the good side of the
law…”
Klein fell silent for a few seconds before letting out a sigh.
“The newspapers never publish any of this… Mr. Frye, I hardly ever
hear you speak so much.”
“I was once a pastor in a workhouse of the Goddess.” Frye
maintained his cold attitude.
When the three of them arrived at the door of the workhouse in West
Borough, they showed their identity documents to the doorkeeper,
who was eyeing the queuers arrogantly, before they were taken into
the workhouse.
The workhouse was transformed from an old church. There were
mattresses and hammocks all over the Mass hall. The pungent scent
of sweat mixed with the smell of Athlete’s foot permeated every
corner.
In and out of the hall, there were many poor families. Some swung
hammers to break rocks, some picked oakum; no one was free.
“In order to not let poor people rely too much on workhouses and
turn into scoundrels, the Poor Law established in 1336 enforced a
rule whereby every poor person can only stay in the workhouse for
ﬁve days at most. Any longer than that, one would be cast out.
During the ﬁve days, they have to do manual labor, such as breaking
rocks or picking oakum. These are the same tasks that criminals in
prison do,” Frye explained to Klein and Leonard brieﬂy without much
emotion.
Leonard opened his mouth, and no one was sure if he was teasing or
explaining, “When they leave this workhouse, they could go to
another one. Of course, they might not be able to move in. Heh,
perhaps, to some people, poor people are like criminals.”
“… Picking oakum?” Klein was quiet. He didn’t know what else to
ask.
“The ﬁbers of old ropes are actually a great material to seal the gaps
in boats.” Frye stopped and found a burnt mark on the ground.
A few minutes later, the director and pastor of the workhouse rushed
over. They were both men in their forties.
“Salus started the ﬁre here and only burnt himself to death?” Leonard
asked, pointing at the ashen mark on the ground.
The director of the workhouse was a man with a broad, bumpy
forehead. He scanned the area where Inspector Mitchell was pointing
with blue eyes and nodded in aﬃrmation.
“Yes.”
“Before that, did Salus act strangely in any way?” Klein asked.
The director of the workhouse thought and said, “According to the
person that slept next to him, Salus had been chanting ‘The Lord has
given up on me’, ‘The world is too ﬁlthy’, ‘I have nothing left’, stuﬀ
along those lines. He was ﬁlled with resentment and hopelessness.
But no one expected him to break all the kerosene lamps and start a
ﬁre to burn the place down while everyone was sleeping. Thank the
Lord, someone found out in time and stopped his wicked act.”
Klein and Leonard then found a few people who had slept next to
Salus the night before, and they also found the guard that stopped
the tragedy. However, those people didn’t have anything new to tell
them.
Of course, they used Spirit Vision, divination, and other methods to
check if any of the people were lying or misleading them.
“It seems that Salus long had the idea to take revenge and self-
destruct. It seems to be a very normal case.” Leonard waited till the
director and the pastor left to express his opinion.
Klein pondered and said, “My divination tells me that a supernatural
factor had inﬂuenced this case.”
“Let’s eliminate Salus’s ﬁre case temporarily,” Leonard concluded.
Just then, Frye suddenly said, “No, maybe there is another
possibility. For example, Salus acted at the instigation of someone
else, a Beyonder who didn’t take any supernatural measures.”
Klein’s eyes lit up as he echoed, “It’s very possible, such as the
Instigator from before!”
Instigator Tris!
But that wouldn’t have any connection with Mrs. Lauwis’s death… He
thought, creasing his eyebrows lightly.
Chapter 121: Leonard's
Hypothesis
After hearing Klein’s and Frye’s guesses, Leonard tugged on his collar
and paced about, saying, “Then we have to investigate everyone in
the workhouse who came into contact with Salus, as well as everyone
he came across after he went bankrupt and was chased out of the
house. It’s very troublesome indeed… Time is of the essence. Let’s
split up and do a cursory check here, then head to the third reported
death in the West Borough and leave the rest to the police.”
“Alright,” Klein answered without hesitation.
Frye didn’t have any objections. He turned towards the people who
had been sleeping near Salus last night.
Klein was about to ﬁnd someone to question when he suddenly saw
Leonard shooting looks at him. He was motioning at the side hall of
the workhouse with his chin.
What does he want? Klein was a little lost. He acted as though nothing
had happened and strolled around the hall, then followed Leonard
into the side hall while Frye was distracted. They made their way
through the partition to a silent corner which had no one else
around.
“I have a hypothesis,” Leonard suddenly said, stopping in front of a
shattered window.
Klein looked around in confusion. “What’s your hypothesis?”
Leonard with his deep green eyes, he returned a question, “If there
were no supernatural factors, what do you think Mrs. Lauwis’s
outcome would’ve been?”
Klein thought for a moment, then said solemnly, “The same, just
delayed by a week or two, perhaps a month. But to a family like
theirs, they would’ve only seen the doctor when she really was at her
limit. As long as her heart problems turned for the worse, there
would be no way for her to be saved.”
“Then what about Salus? If he hadn’t been instigated by someone,
what kind of end would he have?” Leonard asked again.
Klein pondered and said, “From the description in the information,
Salus was already very angry about his bankruptcy, and was furious
that no one saved him. I think that he would’ve exacted his
vengeance sooner or later, but not at the people at the workhouse. He
might’ve targeted the boss that made him bankrupt or the staﬀ of the
bank that seized his house.”
“What would the result of his revenge be?” Leonard pressed on.
“Without a doubt, he had already decided to end his life. He would
have died no matter what the result of his revenge was.” Klein gave
an aﬃrmative answer.
Leonard nodded and revealed his signature ﬂippant smile.
“Then can we conclude that Mrs Lauwis and Salus were both people
fated to die soon?
Klein was a ‘knowledgeable’ keyboard warrior. Upon hearing the
question, he immediately had a guess.
“You’re saying that their deaths were moved forward by some
supernatural factors? But why?”
“A more accurate description would be, their ‘life force’ had been
shortened by some supernatural factor. It was stolen. And life force is
the best material when it comes to summoning evil gods and devils or
conducting terrifying curses.” Leonard smiled as he corrected Klein’s
guess.
“Summoning evil gods and devils or conducting terrifying curses…”
Klein looked into Leonard’s emerald eyes and said, half in doubt,
“You seem to be very sure of this? But, for the time being, our
investigation sample is only at two…”
Leonard laughed cynically. “Klein, there’s no need for any pretense
between us. I saw you break free from the control of Sealed Artifact
2-049, and I know that you’re special. And you should be able to
sense that I’m a little diﬀerent from the average Beyonder.”
His smile disappeared as he looked into Klein’s eyes.
“I’ve told you that there are many special people in this world that
can always do things others can’t, such as you… and me.
“This world has a long history. There are many magical items that
people wish to obtain, to control. They wish to become the stars of
their own show. There aren’t many people like that, but it’s
impossible that there are only one or two of them.
“I don’t think that a Beyonder with his or her secrets is a bad person
or an evil thug. I don’t think that we even need to be clear on where
their special abilities come from, and what they represent… As long
as your actions are not endangering me, the Nighthawks, or Tingen
City, then you’re still my partner. Similarly, I hope that you’ll look at
me with the same attitude. Of course, it’s best not to speak of this to
the higher-ups. Those fogies are old fashioned and conservative,
always thinking that special people like us will deﬁnitely lose control,
deﬁnitely feel the pull and temptation of the evil gods or devils.”
But I have more secrets than you can ever imagine… Klein thought to
himself. He said frankly, “I share the same sentiments as you. I’ll only
look at your actions and your motives and don’t care about how
special you are. I will also try not to probe into your secrets.”
After saying this, he added in his heart, No, actually I do mind and am
very curious, but I’m putting up with it for now. Hmm, Leonard thinks
that he is the star of a show? What kind of encounters did he have, and
what kind of magical items does he possess?
Leonard unfastened the buttons of his shirt and nodded with a
chuckle.
“I’m glad that we have this understanding.
“In action novels, this is called the meeting of two protagonists. The
wheels of history are set in motion.
How shameless! Klein gave a perfunctory smile.
He knew that the phrase “wheels of history are set in motion” came
from the Emperor Roselle…
Leonard paced around quickly, his green eyes brightened as he curled
the corners of his mouth.
“Alright, I’ll be honest; I’m quite conﬁdent that the victims of these
deaths would’ve died within the next three months, but their deaths
have been brought forward to the past two weeks by someone,
through some means. The other party’s motive should be to summon
evil gods or devils, or conduct a terrifying, large-scale curse.”
“It is easy for the culprit to hide their murders, given that their
victims already showed signs that they were going to die soon. This
wouldn’t attract the attention of the police department, or be
disrupted by the Nighthawks, Mandated Punishers, or Machinery
Hivemind during the culprit’s preparatory phase…” Klein muttered to
himself and analyzed the culprit’s thought process.
Leonard smiled and agreed, “That’s right. If three healthy, normal
people were to suddenly drop dead, it would deﬁnitely attract
attention and bring about an investigation.”
“Then how are we going to ﬁnd the altar used for the ritual?
Regardless of whether the culprit wants to summon an evil god,
devil, or conduct a terrible curse, he or she would need a sacriﬁcial
altar, a ritual. The harvested life force would also have to be stored in
a similar place.” Klein chose to believe in Leonard, for he didn’t have
any other clues and was unable to make any other deductions.
It doesn’t hurt to try!
Leonard laughed and said, “Klein, isn’t that within your professional
domain? Can’t you imagine what is happening around an altar like
that?”
Without waiting for Klein to answer, Leonard described, “A thick
aura of death with the altar at the center. There wouldn’t be any
living things other than the person conducting the ritual in a ten-
meter radius. The surrounding temperature would be at least ﬁve
degrees lower than the average temperature, with a cold wind
blowing past it continuously… And the stolen life force of Mrs.
Lauwis and the rest will remain within the altar, sealed by a wall of
spirituality…”
Having said that, he looked at Klein and teased, “I think that you
would be able to divine roughly where an altar with the following
qualities would be.”
Klein frowned slightly and replied solemnly, “As long as it’s within
Tingen City. Furthermore, I would need a quiet place where I
wouldn’t be disturbed. My house, for example. I would also need the
personal belongings of Mrs. Lauwis and the rest, as well.”
Klein’s heart also skipped a beat. He felt that Leonard was a little too
knowledgeable in the dark arts.
“No problem.” Leonard laughed. He suddenly stepped past Klein and
walked toward the hall, not saying anything more.
That man sure has a unique style… Klein cursed in his heart and
followed.
When Leonard found Frye seriously taking notes, he put on a serious
tone and said, “I have a hypothesis and was hoping that Klein would
give it a try.”
“What hypothesis?” Frye asked, appearing cold.
“I’ll tell you if there is a result. I don’t want to be laughed at by
Rozanne and the rest.” Leonard gave a whimsical excuse and changed
the subject.
Frye didn’t ask any further. He acted according to the instructions
and obtained Salus’s and Mrs Lauwis’s personal belongings from the
nearby police station, then met his partners at Klein’s house.
“Wait in the living room and don’t let anybody disturb me.” Klein
took out his pocket watch and looked at the time.
It was about six now. Melissa might come back at anytime.
“You can trust us.” Leonard put his hands on his hips and paced
around the living room. Frye sat silently on the sofa.
Does Leonard have ADHD? Klein pouted and went to his room on the
second ﬂoor. He locked the door and sealed the room with a wall of
spirituality.
After which, he set up an altar and asked for the help of the goddess,
eliminating any disturbances.
Then, Klein wrote a divination statement on a piece of paper.
“The position of the altar.”
He gave a sweeping statement to prevent himself from missing out on
any information.
Grabbing the piece of paper and the belongings of the dead, Klein
laid down on his bed. He ﬁrst recalled the scene Leonard described,
then silently recited the statement seven times.
He didn’t try using the world of fog, ﬁrstly, because that weird and
mysterious Leonard was downstairs. Who knew if he would notice
something weird about the ritual. Secondly, his Seer potion was
about to be completely digested. It was likely that the aid of the
ritual was suﬃcient for the success of his divination.
Klein would only consider ﬁnding an opportunity to enter the world
of fog if he didn’t get a result. After all, the summoning of an evil god
or devil was something that could threaten Benson, Melissa, and
himself!
With the help of Cogitation, he quickly entered the dream and saw a
hazy, illusory, fragmented scene.
Soon after, an image ﬂoated before his eyes.
It was a two-story grayish-blue house bathed in a sunset glow. The
windows of the ﬁrst ﬂoor were shut tight and the dark curtains had
no gaps. However, they expanded and contracted from time to time.
The soil around the house was dark brown, but nothing was growing
in it. The garden around the house seemed to be covered in shadows,
dilapidated, and dark.
There was a river ﬂowing silently near the house.
…
Sometime later, Klein exited the dream, having not seen anything
else.
Leonard’s hypothesis was correct… Where could that building be? There
are too many rivers in Tingen City, such as the West Borough, Southwest
Borough, the harbor area, the university area… He opened his eyes and
rubbed his temples as he thought, his expression serious.
Chapter 122: Target Building
2 Daﬀodil Street. Inside the living room that was painted with the
luster of dusk.
Klein stood in front of the oriel window as he told Frye and Leonard.
“My divination revealed something. I saw a grayish-blue two-story
building in my dream. The windows on the ﬁrst ﬂoor were all shut
tight, and the curtains were drawn. It’s surrounded by a few meters
of brown soil without any greenery or ﬂowers. It also has a terribly
gloomy garden, just like the kind you ﬁnd in a horror story.
“The only characteristic that can be used to identify it is a nearby
river, a slightly broad river.
“It might be the Tussock River or Khoy River. We could only ﬁnd out
through process of elimination. Hopefully we can still make it in
time.”
The Tussock River was the biggest river in the Loen Kingdom, coming
down from the northwest where the Mirminsk mountain was. It
ﬂowed towards the southeast, passing by the Midseashire, Awwa
County, and then passing through the capital, Backlund, and into the
sea near Pritz Harbor.
The locations where it converged in Tingen City included the
southwest corner of the West Borough and the harbor in the South
Borough. The source of the Khoy River came from the northern York
Mountain as it passed through the university district in the East
Borough and locally merged with the Tussock River.
Those were the two main rivers around Tingen. The rest could only
be considered streams, and none of them had an expansive water
surface.
Upon hearing Klein’s description, the pale and cold Frye nodded
lightly in agreement.
Since there were no other clues, process of elimination was the only
eﬃcient method!
Just then, Leonard smiled and said, “Perhaps we can narrow down
the possible locations of the target.”
“How do we narrow down the possibilities?” Klein frowned and
asked in reply as he looked at the silver vine-leaf pocket watch.
Leonard chuckled.
“A criminal with a plan and a goal would select targets somewhere
far away from the location of his altar. This is a result of their natural
instinct—to be safe.
“Only when there aren’t many soon-to-be-dead people left in the
areas far from his altar would he consider the nearer targets.
“So, we should read through the information again, exclude the areas
where the number of death incidents rose rapidly above average
standards.
Klein’s eyes lit up when he heard that.
“Brilliant conjecture!”
At the same time, he sighed inwardly, I really don’t have the talent to
be a detective!
Frye nodded and picked up the documents on the coﬀee table and
started reading it again.
After a few minutes, he deepened his hoarse voice and said, “There
really is such a region, and there’s only one possibility.”
“Which area?” Klein asked.
Frye passed the thick stack of information to Leonard who was next
to him. He pursed his thin lips and said, “West Borough.”
It’s the West Borough? Klein clenched his ﬁst and immediately
suggested,
“Then let’s search the southwestern area of West Borough. That area
isn’t huge!”
“I agree,” Leonard echoed as he waved the papers in his hands in
agreement, as though he wasn’t the one who suggested narrowing
down the scope of their search.
…
The two-wheeled carriage slowly drove along the muddy road. Beside
them, the red and orange glow of the sunset reﬂected oﬀ of a broad
river that was colored with the twilight radiance of the sunset.
Klein and Frye looked out the windows from both sides of the
carriage, inspecting one house after another. They were searching for
a grayish-blue house with a dilapidated garden. If possible, they
would take note if the curtains on the ﬁrst ﬂoor was drawn.
Leonard leisurely sat in his original spot, leaning against the wall of
the carriage as he hummed a popular local tune.
The dim scenery ﬂew past, and Klein caught sight of a grayish-blue
two-story building from the corner of his eye
In front of the building was a gloomy garden that appeared in ruins.
“Found it!” Klein said while suppressing his voice.
Before he ﬁnished his sentence, Frye and Leonard squeezed over to
look out the window. There was almost no space between them.
As the carriage drew closer to the building, the dark curtains that
were drawn on the ﬁrst ﬂoor appeared before the three Nighthawks’
eyes.
Klein didn’t even need to divine whether they had the right building;
he was completely certain that it was the building that he saw in his
dream. That was where the evil altar was set up!
None of them stopped the carriage, but instead allowed the carriage
driver to continue driving forward. They passed their target and
continued away from it, as though they were just passing by.
When they could no longer see the building when they turned
around, Leonard told the driver to stop the carriage.
“Klein, return to Zouteland Street in this carriage and tell the Captain
to come here for assistance.” Leonard snapped his ﬁngers and
smirked at his teammate.
Is he thinking of me as a rookie and that I shouldn’t be involved in such a
dangerous mission? This fellow is still quite a nice guy… Klein was
stunned as he realized what Leonard meant.
Frye nodded in agreement.
“You just started combat training and your job is a support role.”
I know, and a person who could kill so many in order to hold a ritual
won’t be an easy opponent. Only the Captain could make this situation
less terrifying… Klein took a breath and agreed rationally.
He looked at Leonard, then at Frye before forcing a smile and said,
“Be careful.”
“Don’t worry, I cherish my life a lot. Until the Captain arrives, we’ll
only keep watch, and we won’t get close.” Leonard smiled.
Frye didn’t say anything but only picked up his suitcase.
Klein was quiet for a while, he then took out a copper penny and
said, “Let me divine once for you.”
He chanted, “What will happen here will lead to a good outcome.”
He ﬂipped the coin at the same time his eyes turned dark.
Dang!
The coin ﬂipped into the air, then landed ﬁrmly in Klein’s palm.
Klein looked and saw it was the King’s head. He immediately let out
a breath of relief.
“It’s only a blurry symbol, so there are other interpretations. The
most important thing is to be careful and prudent at all times,” he
explained to Frye and Leonard like a Seer would do.
Leonard had already turned around. He waved and jumped oﬀ the
carriage.
“As naggy as my eighty-year-old grandma…”
Frye nodded seriously and got oﬀ with his suitcase.
Watching both his teammates head towards the target building, Klein
touched the revolver in his armpit holster and told the driver,
“Zouteland Street.”
The driver, who had been hired by the hour, didn’t object but
allowed the horses to continue the journey.
…
36 Zouteland Street.
When Klein entered the Blackthorn Security Company, Rozanne, Mrs.
Orianna, and the others had already gotten oﬀ work. It was unusually
quiet and dim.
Dunn was sitting on the sofa in the guest area. The gas lamp was
unlit, and he seemed to blend into the darkness in his black
windbreaker.
“Found any clues?” Klein, who was searching for the Captain, was
given a shock by Dunn’s deep voice.
Klein quickly turned around and looked into Dunn’s gray eyes as he
said, “Yes, we…”
He quickly told him about Leonard’s bold hypothesis, his
conﬁrmation via divination, and the subsequent discovery of the
house.
As for Leonard’s conﬁdence and the uniqueness that Leonard had
discussed, they were unimportant and obviously not worth
mentioning.
Dunn cut in from time to time. When the brieﬁng ended, he abruptly
stood up and walked towards the door.
When he was almost down the stairs, he turned around and said, “I
almost forgot; you stay here just in case there are any emergencies
here.”
“Alright.” Klein nodded solemnly.
At that very moment, other than Kenley who was on duty guarding
Chanis Gate, the other Nighthawks were busy in the ﬁeld.
Dunn Smith ran down a few steps and suddenly stopped. As he put
on his hat, he shouted at Klein through the door, “Lock the door and
follow me. Heh, we won’t need you to join the battle. First, you can
get a sense of the atmosphere, and second, we might require the
assistance of ritualistic magic during the ﬁnal search or inspection.
Remember, until everything is over, you have to be at least ﬁfty
meters away. You cannot get close to the building!”
Klein was stunned and nodded ﬁrmly.
“Alright!”
…
The sun sank beneath the horizon, and the surging Tussock River
turned eerie and dark.
Dark clouds obscured the crimson moon, making the grayish-blue
two-story building look like a monster hidden in the shadows.
The garden before the building was extremely quiet. It was as though
it didn’t have any insects, nor any other forms of life.
Klein looked at the scene from a distance, his palms sweating and his
body shivering.
He felt that there were countless terrifying things hidden, waiting,
and hungry for a bloody feast.
He watched Dunn, Leonard, and Frye move carefully towards the
target building, blending into the darkness.
…
On the second ﬂoor of the grayish-blue building, in the bedroom
without any lights.
A gentle and sweet young maiden with a round face was seated
before her dressing table, looking carefully at her face after the
complicated skin care routine she had just completed.
There was a silver mirror next to her right hand, its surface coarsely
ground, almost unable to reﬂect a ﬁgure.
Suddenly, a stream of blood seeped out from the mirror.
The expression of the gentle and sweet-looking Trissy suddenly grew
grave. She stood up, walked to the window, and looked out in
silence.
Chapter 123: Beyonder Battle
Vines grew all over the dilapidated garden outside the glass windows.
The river ﬂowed softly, reﬂecting the stars in the sky as warm glows
suﬀused out of the nearby buildings.
Everything was silent, as if awaiting the arrival of night.
Trissy, who had ordinary features which combined to make her look
surprisingly beautiful, retracted her gaze and walked quickly towards
the clothes rack to retrieve a long black robe ﬁtted with a hood.
She quickly put the robe on, fastened the buttons and belt before
pulling the hood over her head, transforming herself into an Assassin.
Trissy raised her right hand and swiped her face, immediately turning
her appearance under the hood blurry.
Right on the heels of that, she grabbed a handful of shimmering
powder from the hidden pouch near her waist and scattered it over
herself while reciting an incantation.
Trissy’s ﬁgure started to disappear bit by bit, her outline vanishing
like how pencil marks were being erased by an eraser.
She silently left the bedroom after completing her concealment spell.
She moved to the opposite room and then opened the non-grilled
window.
With a light leap, Trissy stood on the window sill and looked over the
grassy plains to the back of the building. She looked down at the steel
fence that had seemingly fused with the night. There, she saw Corpse
Collector Frye who was silently making his way over the fence.
She took in a deep breath and ﬂuttered down like a feather, stepping
onto the grassy ﬁeld without a sound.
Frye, who was wearing a black windbreaker, cautiously surveyed the
surroundings with his custom revolver in his hand, seeking out
vengeful spirits or evil spirits that might appear.
He could see such entities directly!
Trissy approached Frye silently, made her way behind him. It was
unknown when a dagger smeared with ‘black paint’ appeared in her
hand.
Poof!
She struck quickly, plunging the dagger into Frye’s lower back.
But at this moment, the scene in front of her shattered, as if
everything was an illusion.
Trissy realized that she was still standing on the window sill, still
looking over the grassy ﬁeld and the steel fence.
Except this time around, it wasn’t only Corpse Collector Frye who
was standing outside the fence. There was also Leonard Mitchell who
was aiming straight at the window sill, as well as Dunn Smith. The
captain of the Nighthawks was hunched over as he pressed down on
his glabella, his eyes closed as formless ripples spread outwards from
him.
Trissy’s pupils constricted. She understood that everything that had
happened was just a dream. She had fallen asleep unknowingly!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Leonard and Frye ﬁred three shots, accurately hitting the invisible
target who was still waking up from her reverie.
Crack!
Trissy’s ﬁgure started to appear, ﬁrst cracking, then completely
shattering into fragments of a rough silver mirror!
Inside the building, Trissy, who had used a substitution spell, turned
around to escape. She followed the corridor and the steps, sprinting
all the way to the ﬁrst ﬂoor.
Whoosh! A cold sinister wind blew across the ﬁrst ﬂoor, one that
could freeze a person. Formless, transparent ﬁgures were numbly
pacing around every corner of the building in a daze.
Trissy, who had lost her concealment, felt her temperature drop
every time she passed through the spirits. She could no longer control
her shivers when she ﬁnally reached the sacriﬁcial altar.
The altar was a round table, with a ﬁgurine of a deity carved out of
bone placed in the center.
This ﬁgurine was about the size of a grown man’s head, with only a
mere indication of her eyes, but the ﬁgure was that of a beautiful
woman.
Her hair extended from her head to her heels, each strand clear and
thick, as if they were poisonous snakes or tentacles.
There was only one eye situated at the tip of every strand of hair,
some closed, others open.
There were many puppets strewn around the ﬁgurine. The
craftsmanship of the puppets was crude. Names and relevant
information were written on the puppets; for example, Joyce Mayer.
There were three candles on the table, ﬂickering with a yellowish-
green ﬂame despite the cold, sinister winds.
Trissy bowed at the deity’s ﬁgurine and quickly recited her
incantations.
She then pushed away the puppets and extinguished the ﬂames of the
candles before picking the ﬁgurine up.
Whoosh!
The winds howled ﬁercely as they shook the closed windows
violently.
Clank! Creak! Shards of glass ﬂew around in all directions.
Frye, who had just made his way to the other side of the building,
didn’t dare to barge into the sacriﬁcial altar recklessly. He shivered,
feeling his blood turn cold and frosty. It was making his actions
visibly slower.
Suddenly, he felt tightness around his heels as though they had been
grabbed by something invisible.
An accentuated sense of coldness spread upwards from the point of
contact. A Sequence 9 Beyonder would have turned completely numb
by now. But as a Corpse Collector, Frye was no stranger to such
situations.
He turned his revolver to the side of his heels and pulled the trigger.
It was as if he could see who the enemy was, and exactly where it
was.
Bang!
A silver demon hunting bullet pierced the air, causing a shrill howl in
response.
The formless ﬁgure dissipated and Frye regained his ability to move.
Elsewhere, Dunn Smith, who wanted to reach the second ﬂoor by
avoiding a frontal assault on the altar, was similarly aﬀected by the
cold winds. His body froze as he stopped right outside a shattered
window.
Whoosh! The curtains behind the window lifted suddenly and
engulfed Dunn, as if a monster had just opened its mouth to devour
its prey.
The curtain wrapped around Dunn’s head, seeming to have been
imbued with life. Dunn’s facial features began to press through the
constricting cloth.
Dunn, who was about to be suﬀocated, stomped down with both feet.
He straightened his knees and twisted his waist, loosening the
curtain’s grip with raw strength alone.
He grabbed a corner of the curtain around his head with his left hand
and yanked it away before tossing it toward the ground.
Bang!
He ﬁred a shot at the other half of the curtain behind the window,
stopping it from attempting another assault on him.
The curtain stopped immediately as a dark red liquid oozed out from
it.
Whoosh!
On the ﬁeld, Leonard Mitchell was reciting his poems and was also
hit by the cold sinister winds infused with the intense sensation of
death. His teeth chattered, making it hard for him to enunciate his
poems.
The messy weeds in the garden suddenly extended, wrapping
themselves around his heels. A black shadow hurled itself at him
along with the violent winds.
Leonard, whose body had become rigid, failed to ﬁre in time. He
could only pull back his shoulder and raise his arm.
Thud! The black shadow smashed into his forearm, the thorns on its
body piercing his skin.
It was a pretty, bright-red ﬂower, its origins unknown.
In pain, Leonard tossed aside the ﬂower dyed with his blood.
Bang! He ﬁred a shot at the spreading vines, causing dark red liquid
to ooze out.
Tap! Tap! Tap! Leonard quickened his pace and charged towards the
shattered window on the ﬁrst ﬂoor where the altar was situated
behind.
The vines retracted abruptly from where he had previously stood, as
if hiding from something invisible.
Trissy took advantage of the chaos created by destroying the altar
and a suspension-style ritual to conceal herself once again. She
managed to fool the Spirit Visions of the Nighthawks and escape the
pincer attack before making her way to a spot behind the three
Nighthawks.
She extended her right hand, immediately causing a cold wind to
blow. It carried the ﬂower dyed with Leonard’s blood right into her
palm.
Trissy did not stop. With the ﬂower in hand, she nimbly made her
way over the steel fence and escaped in the direction of the Tussock
River.
Leonard, who had just entered the ﬁrst level, turned his head
abruptly, as though he was listening to something.
His expression changed. He frantically pulled up his sleeve and
looked at the wound caused by the ﬂower.
With his constitution, the wound had already stopped bleeding. There
was only some red swelling that remained.
Leonard’s expression became grim. He pinched his left index ﬁnger
and pulled his ﬁngernail straight out!
His face contorted in pain, but he did not pause. As he recited
something silently, he sliced open the coagulated wound with the
ﬁngernail. When the ﬁngernail was dyed with his dark red blood, he
pulled out a few strands of hair from his scalp and wrapped the
ﬁngernail with his hair.
Beside the Tussock River, Trissy slowed down. She shot her gaze
toward the ﬂower in her hand.
She was chanting something as a ball of black, illusory ﬁre suddenly
appeared in her palm.
The ﬂames enveloped the ﬂower, burning it to ashes.
After completing this, Trissy jumped into the river and submerged
herself.
At the same time, Leonard tossed the blood-stained ﬁngernail
wrapped in his hair to the corner. He saw it burn and release a foul
stench.
The ﬁngernail and hair disappeared quickly, leaving only some dust
behind.
Leonard heaved a sigh of relief. He entered the ﬁrst level through the
window and said to Dunn and Frye who were destroying the altar,
“The target has escaped. But it’s alright, our primary objective was to
stop the ritual.”
Dunn sighed and looked at the puppets on the table.
“She was very cautious and very powerful. She sensed us
approaching her ahead of time, otherwise… she should be, at the
very least, a Sequence 7 Beyonder.
“Give Klein the signal. Ask him to come over.”
Through the brief interaction in the dream, he had determined that
the enemy was female.
Chapter 124: Wrapping Up
Work
Klein was hidden in the shadows of a building dozens of meters away
from the target building. He heard the faint sound of gunshots and
the howling of violent winds.
If the enemy runs towards me, should I draw my gun or should I pretend
that I didn’t see him? He thought as he shivered in cold sweat.
A Beyonder that could, through various means, cut short the lives of
others deﬁnitely wasn’t a Sequence 9 or Sequence 8 Beyonder. They
certainly wouldn’t be someone that a Seer like him could ﬁght
against face to face. Even if he sacriﬁced himself, he might not be
able to slow the target down enough for Dunn and Leonard to catch
up with him.
It was fortunate that the Evernight Goddess, the Mistress of Disaster,
seemed to hear her ‘loyal’ guard’s prayers. No one ran towards the
location where Klein was hiding.
After a few minutes, he heard a melodious song coming from the
target building.
Cocking his ears to the side so he could hear better, Klein conﬁrmed
that it was the popular local tune that Leonard Mitchell always
hummed. It was ﬁlled with base words.
Phew. He let out a breath of relief. He held his gun in one hand and
his cane in the other. He then walked out of the shadows towards the
target building.
The popular local tune was the meeting signal that he had agreed
upon with Dunn and the rest!
Klein took two steps and suddenly paused. He leaned his cane against
the metal fencing and switched the revolver to his other hand.
Then, he took oﬀ the silver chain inside his sleeve and let the topaz
pendant hang down naturally.
Klein waited till the topaz stabilized and immediately closed his eyes
and entered a Cogitation state. He recited a divination statement,
“The singing earlier was an illusion.
“The singing earlier was an illusion.”
…
After repeating seven times, he opened his eyes and saw the pendant
spinning counterclockwise.
“It’s not an illusion…” Klein put away his pendulum, grabbed his
cane, and quickly got close to the arch-shaped metal gate leading to
the target building. He then passed the black cane to his right hand
and held it with the revolver.
He extended his hands to touch the fence, intending to push it open,
but he suddenly felt a piercing chill. It was as though someone had
poured a bucket of ice down his neck without warning.
Klein hissed and jerked his hands back, his teeth clenched.
“It’s just like winter here…” Under the dim starlight and distant
street lamp, he looked through the garden behind the metal fencing.
He saw the withered branches, fallen ﬂowers, and leaves covered
with white frost on the brown soil.
Amazing! Klein marveled in his head. He bent his ﬁngers and tapped
his glabella to activate his Spirit Vision.
He returned his silver-inlaid cane to his left hand and pushed it
against the fence to open the closed gate.
The gate squeaked, and he passed through it sideways. He stepped
onto the stone path that led directly to the grayish-blue building. On
both sides of the path were twisted plants that seemed to resemble
ghouls in the dark.
The scene reminded Klein of various horror stories and paranormal
ﬁlms.
He subconsciously slowed down his breathing and walked faster.
However, after just a few more steps, someone suddenly patted his
left shoulder.
Badump! Badump! Klein’s heart skipped, then started thumping
rapidly.
He raised his right hand, aimed his revolver, and slowly turned
around to look.
In the dim light, he saw a ﬂimsy branch that had nearly fallen oﬀ.
“This is what we call ‘scaring ourselves’?” Klein twitched the corner
of his lips, waved the cane, and knocked the branch oﬀ.
He continued moving forward as faint sobs sounded in his ears.
Blurry, translucent “shadows” appeared before his eyes.
These shadows had swarmed over after feeling the breaths of a living
person and the warmth of ﬂesh and blood.
Klein jumped in fright and immediately ran into the door of the
grayish-blue building.
This is what the Captain meant by “getting a sense of the atmosphere?”
It’s much scarier than the last time I helped Sir Deweyville… The
resentment of that aggrieved spirit is more “rigid” than the shadows. She
hadn’t taken the initiative to attack back then… He thought as he
walked towards the altar in the middle of the living room. It was a
round table full of crudely made puppets. Three unlit candles stood
amidst the puppets.
Dunn Smith stood right before the altar with his back to Klein. He
took one puppet after another and looked at them.
Corpse Collector Frye looked at the ﬂoating shadows and extended
his hand in an attempt to comfort them, but all his hand did was pass
through them helplessly. The shadows didn’t attack him, seemingly
recognizing him as one of their own.
When Leonard Mitchell noticed Klein’s arrival, he changed his tone,
turning his voice softer but charming.
“Calm is the morn without a sound,
“Calm as to suit a calmer grief.
“And only thro’ the faded leaf,
“The chestnut pattering to the ground 1 .”
…
In the soothing recitation of the poem, Klein seemed to see a clear
lake reﬂecting the moonlight and a crimson moon hanging quietly,
high in the sky.
The restless shadows calmed down and stopped chasing after the
warm breath of the living Nighthawks among them.
Dunn put down the puppet in his hand, turned around, and said to
Klein, “This is a ceremony for a terrifying curse. It’s fortunate that
we’ve already destroyed it.
“First prepare a ritual to comfort the remaining spirits, then try to
communicate with the spirits of the dead and see if you can get any
clues from them.”
Klein, who realized that he was no longer a burden, immediately held
his chest out and said, “Yes, Captain.”
He reached the altar in a few steps and extended his hands to sweep
the puppets oﬀ of the round table.
At that moment, he noticed from the corner of his eyes that every
puppet had a name and a corresponding message.
“Captain, did you discover anyone you know?” Klein asked in
passing.
Then, he glanced at Dunn as Dunn looked at him. Both of them fell
silent.
I’m so silly… Why would I ask any questions that tests the Captain’s
memory! Klein nearly covered his face and sighed.
If it were any other boss, they would deﬁnitely ﬁnd an opportunity to
make my life diﬃcult because of this. Luckily, the Captain will forget
about this… I wonder if that’s an advantage or a disadvantage? He
thought, half glad, half joking.
After a short silence, Dunn seemed to ﬁnally be capable of
diﬀerentiating reality from the dreamworld. He replied, “There’s
someone you know.”
“Who?” Klein stopped, his hand still extended to put a candle back to
where it was supposed to be.
“Joyce Mayer, the survivor of the Alfalfa tragedy,” Dunn replied
simply.
Joyce Mayer? Anna’s ﬁancé… Klein suddenly thought of Salus in the
workhouse. He seemed to have been instigated and misled by
someone, causing him to bring forward his rage and committing
arson.
Klein retracted his right hand and said in a deep voice, “Instigator
Tris?”
“He used the lives that were cut short as a sacriﬁce, intending to
curse all survivors of the Alfalfa tragedy? Because he didn’t know
who uncovered his involvement and lodged a police report…”
If Tris took revenge directly, it would have been impossible to wipe
out all the targets scattered throughout Tingen. After two or three
murders, he would’ve been noticed by the Nighthawks, Mandated
Punishers, and the Machinery Hivemind. Then, he would’ve lost his
chance to continue his murdering spree. Klein ﬁlled in the blanks of
why Tris had started all this.
Dunn nodded ﬁrst, then he shook his head.
“Not all survivors, but only survivors in Tingen. His curse ritual can
only aﬀect the people within this range.”
“Besides, the host of the ritual is a female, not Tris.”
Klein creased his eyebrows and asked, “Perhaps it’s an expert that the
Theosophy Order sent to help Tris?
“Yes, the origins of the Theosophy Order might involve the Demoness
Sect. It’s fairly normal for their experts to be female.”
Dunn smiled and said in his deep voice, “I agree with your judgment.
Although we only encountered that woman and not Tris, there are
guesses that we can make. Such as, the woman and Tris don’t stay
together. Or, that Tris was out looking for people who are dying
soon.”
Klein didn’t say anything further. He set the three candles in place,
took out the Full Moon Essence Oil, crimson sandalwood, and other
ingredients, and set up the altar quickly.
After he used a silver dagger to make a sealed wall, he started
praying to the Evernight Goddess, the Mistress of Calm and Silence.
He prayed that the shadows inside and outside the house would be
comforted completely.
Unfortunately, in the subsequent attempt to communicate with the
spirits of the dead, Klein could only see a little of what the spirits had
seen before their deaths. There weren’t any useful clues.
After settling the shadows into a peaceful sleep in the dark night, he
ended the ceremony and removed the spirituality wall. He then shook
his head and told the others,
“The backlash from the disrupted ritual caused severe damage and
the remnant images of the host were lost.”
Dunn wasn’t surprised. He pointed at the stairs and said, “Let’s look
around on the second ﬂoor and give it another try.”
“Okay.” Klein, Leonard, and Frye nodded in agreement.
The three Nighthawks went up the stairs to the second ﬂoor and
parted ways to search through each room.
In the end, they met in a bedroom that was ﬁlled with a faint aroma.
They saw messy dresses lying around and open boxes.
Dunn took up a box from the dressing table and smelled it before
asking, “Are these cosmetics?”
“To be exact, they are skin care products. Ever since Emperor Roselle,
they were not lumped together with a broad term,” Leonard
explained with a smile. “Captain, as a gentleman, there are certain
things you have to know.”
Klein didn’t join their discussion but cast his gaze towards the mirror
on the dressing table.
There was an obvious crack on the mirror, and there were shattered
pieces on the rug beneath.
“The Beyonder left in a rush. She didn’t destroy it entirely…” he
suddenly said in a deep voice. “Maybe I could give this a try.”
“I’ll leave it to you,” Dunn replied in conﬁdence.
Klein quickly brought the candles up from the ﬁrst ﬂoor and lit them
in front of the shattered mirror.
Under the dim, ﬂickering candlelight, he took out the items like Full
Moon Essence to create a spirituality wall.
After Klein prepared everything, he stood before the mirror that
reﬂected the lights of all three candles and chanted in Hermes,
“I pray for the power of the dark night.
“I pray for the power of the mystery.
“I pray for the Goddess’s loving grace.
“I pray for the mirror to receive a brief restoration, I pray for it to
show every person that it reﬂected in the past month.”
…
As the incantation was being recited, a strong wind suddenly howled
within the spirituality wall.
The shattered pieces of the mirror swirled oﬀ the ground and
returned to their original locations.
The mirror that was covered in cracks suddenly rippled with a
gloomy brilliance. Klein wiped his hands over it and a human ﬁgure
suddenly appeared in the frame. But that ﬁgure wasn’t Klein.
It was a gentle and sweet looking young maiden with a round face.
Perhaps it was because the mirror was broken or perhaps it was
because the backlash of the interrupted ritual that aﬀected the second
ﬂoor as well. Her facial features were blurry and her actual
appearance wasn’t exactly clear.
But even so, Klein found the person unusually familiar.
Chapter 125: Bold Idea
When faced with a strange sense of familiarity, other Sequence 9
Beyonders might try their best to recall or even disregard and forget
about it. But a Seer was diﬀerent. Klein immediately ended the ritual
and dispelled the wall of spirituality. He took out a piece of paper
and wrote on it a statement: “The source of the sense of familiarity.”
After which, he sat on the edge of the bed in the room and silently
recited it with the piece of paper in hand.
Seven times later, his pupils became darker. He fell asleep with the
help of Cogitation and started conversing with his own spirituality.
In the hazy, contorted world, Klein saw a carriage. He saw a young
lady wearing a long gray dress.
This lady had smooth black hair, her face a little round. She had a
gentle and pleasant demeanor, but her body was shivering
unnaturally.
The image ﬂickered and once again, Klein saw this young, pretty lady
at the underground market. She was squatting and conversing with
someone.
The dream receded quickly and Klein woke up, understanding why
the image he saw in the mirror was so familiar.
He had met this person before!
The ﬁrst time was at Daﬀodil Street, in the district near Iron Cross Street.
The Captain and the rest were chasing down Instigator Tris that night…
There must be a connection. Klein thought for a few seconds, then set
up the ritual once again. He asked for the help of the Goddess to
sketch the portrait of the enemy in his memory.
Dunn and the rest had been waiting silently, without interrupting
Klein unnecessarily. Only when he was done sketching did they
crowd over and inspect the portrait.
“You met her before?” Dunn asked.
Klein nodded slightly and answered simply, “Yes. I saw her at the
public carriage stop on Daﬀodil Street the night when you were going
after the Instigator. It was in the district near Iron Cross Street.”
“Then, there’s a good chance that she was the enemy just now. The
partner of the Instigator.” Dunn nodded in thought.
Leonard suddenly chimed in, “Don’t any of you feel that this portrait
is very familiar? She looks a lot like Instigator Tris!”
Klein froze, immediately casting his gaze at the portrait again and
studying it carefully.
“Yeah, they look very similar indeed. Round face, narrow eyes, gentle
demeanor…” The more he looked at the portrait, the more he felt
that what Leonard said made sense. The biggest diﬀerence was that
Instigator Tris had ordinary features while the young lady could be
considered pretty.
Klein raised his head and looked at Leonard, noticing that he was
signaling something to him by raising his brows.
What does he mean? Klein was confused.
Dunn Smith guessed, “She could be the Instigator’s sister. Maybe like
her brother she joined the Theosophy Order or the Demoness Sect.”
Leonard sighed after he realized how bad Klein was at reading his
mind. He said in a serious tone, “I have a bold idea.”
“What idea?” Dunn asked.
Leonard described succinctly, “I think that this person is Instigator
Tris!”
“What?” Frye exclaimed in shock.
Dunn creased his brows and said, “What you mean is that Instigator
Tris is actually female, or a male who’s pretending to be a female?
No, from the dream, I can conﬁrm that she’s female.”
Klein had been exposed to many creative and ridiculous plots after
all. He took another look at the portrait and immediately had another
guess.
“Could it be that Instigator Tris became a female?”
That could explain many things. For example, why would the trail leading
to Tris suddenly sever? Why couldn’t they ﬁnd any traces, even with
divination? Perhaps because there was a fundamental change to their
target! The only question was how he could change into a woman in such
a short span of time. And it appeared to be rather simple… He had pretty
decent looks after his transformation even. I mean, to be honest, she’s
pretty attractive… Klein thought, distracted.
Leonard nodded in relief, “Yes, that’s my theory. This can perfectly
explain why Instigator Tris had seemed to vanish. It also ﬁts with the
strange fact that the upper echelons of the Demoness Sect are all
female.”
Dunn and Frye were momentarily at a loss for words.
Even though they had seen many monsters and wondrous things, it
was their ﬁrst time dealing with a transformation like this!
“What you mean is that there are a considerable number of women in
the upper echelons of the Demoness Sect that used to be men?” Dunn
asked. He didn’t wait for an answer before saying, “That could be
possible… Perhaps it’s their, no, the unique characteristic of their
potion.”
Klein shivered a little as he listened. He felt that the potion of the
Demoness Sect was a trap!
“Let’s hope that a similar potion doesn’t exist in the pathway of the
Seer… No, deﬁnitely not. That is the pathway of the Demoness. Even
the name of the potion sounds wrong. But I still don’t know what the
corresponding Sequence 1 to Seer is…” Klein subconsciously started
praying to the Goddess.
“Can potions accomplish such a thing?” Frye asked with a little
disbelief.
Leonard laughed and threw up his hands.
“Even a mid to low sequence potion can cause unimaginable changes.
After all, they all originated from the Creator.”
Dunn turned to look at Klein. “Try to divine where the target will
appear next.”
“Alright.” Klein went over to the pile of dresses and picked out one
with mixed emotions. He spread it over the carpet.
He held his cane over the dress and recalled the target’s features and
relevant information. He then began to recite in his heart.
“Tris’s… no, Trissy’s whereabouts
“Trissy’s whereabouts.”
…
Seven times later, Klein’s pupils turned from brown to black. Wind
started to blow around him.
His left hand released his cane, allowing the black cane to wobble.
Despite the shaking, the cane failed to fall. It stood tall in its original
position.
“There’s an interference…” Klein said with a deep tone.
An interference implies that our assumptions are correct!
That lady just now was most probably Instigator Tris, no, Trissy!
Upon seeing this, Dunn nodded indiscernibly.
“They live up to the reputation of the Demoness Sect which has been
active since the last Epoch…”
Since Tris had transformed into Trissy, Dunn deduced that she wasn’t
part of the Theosophy Order, but the Demoness Sect.
Surveying the surroundings, Dunn sighed and said, “We can search
for her through diﬀerent means, such as where these clothes came
from or the owner of this house. We can also get the police
department to patrol the train stations and piers.”
We might be able to get some clues like that, but Trissy will deﬁnitely have
had enough time to leave Tingen. Yes… I’ll try it again above the gray fog
when I’m back at home. Klein was cautious of people like Trissy who
wanted to unleash a massacre on a whim. He wanted to desperately
ﬁnd her and execute her on the spot.
“Leonard, head to the police department and gather a group to wrap
up things here. Klein, you can go back and rest now…” Dunn rubbed
his temples and paused for a few seconds. He said to Klein, partially
to test him and also to teach him. “How would you have handled this
evening’s mission? Assume that me, Leonard, and Frye are the only
members on your team.”
Klein creased his brows and thought for more than ten seconds.
“I’d ﬁrst use divination to ascertain if the ritual would take eﬀect
soon. If the answer was negative, then I’d stick to observing and not
approach. Then I’d notify the police department to deploy personnel
around the area, as well as gather at least ﬁve cannons to bombard
the entire building till wherever Trissy was hiding was leveled.
“She could either be blasted to death in the building, or attempt to
ﬂee amidst the cannon ﬁre. This would easily expose her. Until then,
I would station you and the rest at diﬀerent spots…”
He got more and more excited as he continued. He felt that his idea
was simple and eﬀective, barbaric and decisive. It was very safe and
very appropriate!
Dunn, Leonard, and Frye were dumbfounded. They didn’t say
anything for a long time.
“Captain, is that not a good idea?” The excited Klein’s heart thumped
rapidly when he saw that they had no reaction.
Dunn was silent for a few seconds before he said, “No, it is a good
idea. But the premise is that we have to conﬁrm that forceful
destruction of the altar wouldn’t create a more disastrous outcome…
Sigh. As longtime Nighthawks, we’re accustomed to relying on
ourselves, our powers as Beyonders, and guns in all circumstances.
We’re not used to allowing normal people to come into contact with
supernatural incidents…”
Alright, I was always an ardent fan of ﬁrepower bombardment… Klein
added in his heart.
…
Klein and Leonard walked to the carriage station about ﬁve hundred
meters away before they saw it.
After waiting for a while, they returned to Iron Cross Street. One
went to the nearby police station, while the other returned to
Daﬀodil Street.
When Klein arrived at his front door, he adjusted his clothes and
made sure that everything was alright before ﬁshing out his keys and
opening the door.
Melissa and Benson were in the living room, quietly doing
assignments and reading books respectively under the light from the
gas lamp.
Benson must be tired after toiling at work the entire day; yet, he
perseveres in his studies after he comes home. What a determined man… I
can’t do that, all I can think about now is lying down… Klein glanced at
his brother and smiled, giving a silent greeting by raising his hand.
Benson smiled and said, “I now understand the price behind a
handsome salary.”
“There’s a price for everything in this world. There’s something we
must give before we can gain anything in return,” Klein said, leaving
his cane on the rack next to the door.
“That’s apparently something Emperor Roselle said, right?” Melissa
stopped writing and looked up.
The Tingen Technical School was diﬀerent from universities and
public schools. There was only two weeks for summer break, from
late July to early August. Their lessons resumed the moment the
hottest days were over.
“Is that so? I don’t remember…” Klein replied, his expression a little
rigid.
He took oﬀ his hat and headed upstairs. He intended to divine
Trissy’s whereabouts as soon as possible.
Suddenly, he heard his stomach rumble. He felt intense hunger
pangs.
Oh right, I haven’t had dinner. But the note I left said that the security
company would provide food and asked them not to leave any food for
me… Seriously, Captain, you actually forgot about it… Klein’s
expression changed several times as he intended to pretend that he
was full.
At that moment, Melissa turned and looked at him. She pointed to
the kitchen and said, “We left a small piece of lamb chop and a bowl
of thick vegetable soup for you. There are a few sticks of bread left
too.”
After saying this, she buried her head back into her work and
muttered to herself, “I felt that meals provided by work wouldn’t be
too good, probably making people lose their appetite…”
Chapter 126: Divination Isn't
All-Powerful
Sis, you worry too much, no—you’re just so meticulous! Klein was
suddenly energized. He smiled and said, “Melissa, your concern is
very reasonable. It’s true that I’m actually a little hungry. Yeah, let
me change and take a shower.”
Although his mouth was already watering, it was even more
important to conﬁrm Instigator Trissy’s whereabouts!
No one knew what insane measures that bastard would take in order
to exact revenge on society!
“Okay.” Melissa didn’t lift her head but continued her revision.
Tap. Tap. Tap. Klein ran to the second ﬂoor and entered his bedroom.
He locked the door, took oﬀ his jacket, and armpit holster. Then, he
took out a simple silver knife from the drawer.
After sealing his room with a spirituality wall, he took a breath,
steadied his emotions, and walked four steps counterclockwise.
After the usual incantation, Klein appeared once again in the lofty
palace above the gray fog. He was getting used to the mad ravings
that he heard during the transportation process.
Having completed a few rituals that day, he massaged his temples as
he was slightly tired. He willed a piece of brown goatskin to appear
on the long bronze table.
Klein thought seriously, then wrote down the divination statement:
“Trissy’s whereabouts.”
He wasn’t sure if the name was written correctly, but he could use
the girl’s appearance and other detailed information as a guide as
well.
He held the goatskin and leaned back into the chair. He recalled the
things related to Trissy in his head, then recited the divination
statement seven times.
He emptied his mind, closed his eyes, and entered a dream state with
the aid of Cogitation.
In the illusory scene amidst the fog, he saw a steam engine that
spurted dense smoke and sparks. He also saw the rows of leather
seats in a clean train carriage.
The gentle and sweet-looking Trissy with her round face and long
eyes sat near a window. There was a checkered ﬁshnet hat on the
table before her.
Klein made repeated attempts to conﬁrm the train number, but he
failed to discern it.
Soon, he couldn’t stand the pressure and left his dream. The long
bronze table and illusory crimson stars appeared before his eyes
again.
“I could only conﬁrm that Trissy took the steam locomotive and left
Tingen. There weren’t any more clues… Sigh, it seems like this
mysterious space only helps me eliminate interferences, but it doesn’t
do much to enhance the standard of my divinations…” Klein rapped
the edge of the table and thought about his next step.
Through the divination, he could be entirely certain that the target
had once been Instigator Tris. The new Trissy, however, was already
ﬂeeing Tingen. Given the circumstances, he didn’t think his new
divination would help Dunn.
Klein quickly made a decision. “Captain already said that he would
send a telegram to Backlund, Enmat Harbor, and other main stops
along the railway, so they Trissy will be placed on the wanted list
throughout the country. I won’t report the divination result then, in
case it would draw suspicion towards me…” Klein quickly made up
his mind, because regardless of his warning, Dunn was already using
the most appropriate measures to follow up on the matter.
Since he couldn’t see the train number in the dream divination, using
the spirit pendulum and other methods would be equally ineﬀective,
even if he attempted to do so by process of elimination.
It was just like the situation with the red chimney.
At that moment, he felt mentally drained, so he didn’t stay above the
gray fog any longer but enveloped himself with his spirituality and
simulated the feeling of falling.
When he “returned” to his room, his mind was ﬁlled with the thought
of tasty, glistening mutton.
“I must add some fennel… Praise the Lady!” Klein swallowed his
saliva, swiftly removed the spirituality wall, and opened his door.
…
The next morning at twenty minutes to nine, he entered the
Blackthorn Security Company with his cane in hand.
“Good morning, Klein! I have good news!” Rozanne waved her hands
excitedly from behind the reception desk.
Klein eyes lit up as he asked, “We caught Trissy?”
“Trissy? Who is she?” The green-dressed Rozanne looked lost.
“… You probably don’t know her. What’s the good news?” Klein
redirected the topic.
Rozanne replied with a glowing smile, “The Captain’s request has
been approved. The police department is going to transfer two police
staﬀ members who have come across supernatural incidents to be
clerks here! I ﬁnally don’t need to frequently stay up all night! Praise
the Lady!”
“That’s great news,” Klein echoed sincerely.
After exchanging a few more pleasantries with Rozanne, he went
through the partition and went underground. He planned to continue
with his mysticism lessons.
When he passed the Captain’s oﬃce and the Nighthawks’
entertainment room, he popped his head in and looked around. He
saw that Dunn, Leonard, and the rest were still there. It meant that
the search and elimination investigation the night before had failed
to return anything worthwhile. The rest would be handed over to the
police department, so that they could take care of the tedious follow-
up tasks.
At ﬁrst, Klein wanted to chat with the Captain to get an update on
the situation. But he saw that Captain was busy typing telegrams, so
he decided not to disturb him. He could ask the Captain again at
lunch.
He went underground by following the stairs and saw the two classic
gas lamps in their metal racks. He saw the ever-quiet corridor which
was lit up by the light behind the glass.
He breathed in the cold but refreshing breeze, took a few steps, and
suddenly stopped.
He suddenly looked towards the gas lamp and his eyebrows gradually
creased.
He had made a crucial mistake!
A mistake that could only be made by someone with knowledge from
Earth!
In his divination above the gray fog the night before, Klein had seen
Trissy taking a steam locomotive. Hence, he subconsciously believed
that it was something happening at that moment.
But—this world had yet to invent electric lights or similar equipment.
When the sky grew dark, there were almost no steam locomotives in
operation that ferried humans. Klein, who was accustomed to trains
which operated at night, had instinctively missed out on that fact!
In other words, it wasn’t something that happened last night!
It was a scene from the future!
Which meant that it was going to happen that day or the day after!
Klein’s heartstrings tightened and he paced back and forth. Then he
went upstairs again.
He knocked and opened the door to the entertainment room, and he
saw that Leonard was reciting a poem by the window, looking
helpless.
Klein ignored Kenley, Royale, and Seeka Tron who were playing
cards. He looked towards Leonard and said, “I have a question for
you.”
“Would it be that you want to learn tricks to entertain the ladies?”
Leonard teased, putting down Selected Poems by Roselle.
He exited the entertainment room and followed Klein halfway down
the stairs that led underground. He then looked into Klein’s eyes and
said with a chuckle, “It seems like you did a successful divination last
night.”
Klein didn’t explain further but said straightforwardly, “I divined that
Trissy will leave on a steam locomotive.”
After their conversation at the workhouse in the West Borough, he
didn’t mind appearing slightly special before Leonard.
“Steam locomotive, the earliest train is at seven in the morning…”
Leonard took out his pocket watch from his shirt and ﬂipped it open
to take a glance. “No time to waste! I’ll tell the Captain that I
received a reliable tip.”
He quickly went upstairs and left the Blackthorn Security Company.
After being gone for a few minutes, he returned and went into Dunn
Smith’s oﬃce.
Klein heaved a sigh of relief and watched the Captain send a telegram
after gathering the other Nighthawks who were playing cards. They
soon left out the door.
Recalling what happened earlier, he felt conﬂicted. It was a diﬀerent
lesson than the one he received from the death of the suited clown.
He had committed a mistake with similar characteristics which made
him seem to understand this lesson more, leaving a deeper
impression on him.
Turning past the armory and entering the duty room, he took oﬀ his
top hat and coat, then hung them onto the clothes rack naturally.
Old Neil had just ﬁnished making himself some hand-ground coﬀee.
He happily took a sip and asked, “Would you like one?”
“Alright.” Klein sat down, as carefree as if he had returned home.
Old Neil glanced at him and frowned, quipping, “Still three cubes of
sugar with a spoon of milk? You’re such a sweet tooth. This is
harmful to your teeth and your body.”
“No, no, no, I only like it sweet when I’m drinking coﬀee. When I
have grilled steak or roasted meat, I prefer rose salt, black pepper,
fennel, and other condiments.” Klein always believed that he was a
fan of all ﬂavors.
Old Neil ﬁnished the coﬀee quickly. He pushed it over and said, “Do
you want to take a break or start straightaway?”
“Let me settle down for a few minutes. The Captain and the team got
a tip about Trissy’s whereabouts, and they are on the way to the
steam locomotive station. I wonder what the outcome will be…”
Klein sighed.
Old Neil clicked his tongue and said, “Is the tip detailed enough? Are
they sure which train it is?”
“No, it’s not conﬁrmed,” Klein said, pursing his lips.
Old Neil suddenly laughed. “Under such circumstances, the
possibility of failure is much higher than success. Trissy should be a
Sequence 7 Beyonder and a Beyonder at that level won’t be captured
so easily. Heh heh, don’t rely on divination, divination isn’t all-
powerful. You’ll only obtain symbolic signs which are very easy to
interpret them wrongly or ignore something.”
Klein recalled the mistake that he made this time and felt
melancholic. He nodded sincerely.
“Yeah, divination isn’t all-powerful.”
After he said that, he sighed. His mind, body, and soul suddenly
entered a magical state. He leaned backwards slightly, intending to
let out a breath. Just then, he suddenly heard an illusory shattering
noise in his ear.
He felt something dissolving inside him, blending together with his
spirit.
Klein half-closed his eyes and experienced the unique and
indescribable feeling in silence.
Klein didn’t need anyone to tell him that it was a result of the
complete digestion of the Seer potion.
…
The ﬁrst town that the Tussock River passed by after it ﬂowed
through Tingen City was called Wienia. It was also the ﬁrst stop from
Tingen to Backlund for the steam locomotive.
On the platform, Trissy changed into a long beige dress and put on a
woman’s circular hat. Fine ﬁshnet gauze hung down from the edge of
her hat, covering half her face. Her appearance became blurry and
indiscernible.
She had already sent a telegram to her partner in Tingen, to remind
the other person to be careful. She told them that she had used
money she burgled to buy a steam locomotive ticket to Backlund.
The reason Trissy didn’t get on the train from Tingen but went
downstream to Wienia was because she still had her instinct and rich
experience as an assassin.
Woo!
A train let out a long and sharp whistle as the long metal behemoth
chugged to a stop next to the platform while spurting smoke and
sparks.
Trissy didn’t carry any luggage and entered the ﬁrst cabin. At the
same time, she decided to get oﬀ the train after three stations and
enter Backlund through other methods.
…
In the basement of Saint Selena Cathedral, Klein closed his eyes and
leaned backwards in his seat.
He took in the complete digestion of the potion, and he faintly saw
one illusory star after another. Those stars seemed to share a baﬄing
connection with him, and they seemed to want to lump together and
fuse as one.
After the indescribable feeling of hunger and thirst receded, Klein
returned to normal and stopped having any additional experiences.
But my mind feels a lot more relaxed and pure… He opened his eyes
and thought.
At that moment, he knew that he had become a real, complete Seer.
Chapter 127: Laying the
Foundations
The light of the gas lamp glowed through the glass, illuminating the
guard room. Old Neil ﬁnished ﬂipping through his newspaper, took a
sip of coﬀee, and looked at Klein.
“How do you feel now? Have you calmed down? Or do you need a
glass of wine, or an advance on your salary, or a day oﬀ?”
Klein, who had completely digested the Seer potion, was attempting
to change his “switch” that activated his Spirit Vision with
Cogitation. He didn’t want it to be too obvious.
The present him no longer needed to rely on a physical motion to
activate his Spirit Vision. Therefore, he could use a more concealed
approach to achieve his goal; for example, stroking the joints of his
middle ﬁnger with his thumb in quick succession, or clicking twice
with his left molar.
Klein considered the situations in which he needed to use his Spirit
Vision while holding a revolver in one hand and a cane in the other.
Finally, he settled on clicking his molar. His left molar would be used
to activate the Spirit Vision, and his right molar to deactivate it.
After repeatedly suggesting to himself, he completed the change. He
then opened his eyes and smiled.
“I was merely too concerned about the Captain’s operation. I don’t
need to calm myself down.”
At the same time, he clicked his left molar twice and attempted to
activate his Spirit Vision. He wanted to familiarize himself with this
method as quickly as possible.
Cough! Cough! Cough! Old Neil started coughing violently. He
coughed till his face turned red, like a cooked lobster.
“What happened?” Klein froze before asking in concern.
He scanned Old Neil’s aura seriously, only to notice that the colors
representing his health were still normal, only a little dull due to his
age.
Old Neil coughed for nearly twenty seconds before earning respite.
He felt for his cup of coﬀee and slowly took a sip. “Everyone makes
mistakes, ahem. I choked on my drink just now… Shall we begin our
mysticism lessons for today?”
“Alright.” Klein silently clicked his right molars twice.
Klein was elated, yet frustrated that he had completely digested the
Seer potion a week or two ahead of his prediction. He was naturally
glad that he was freed from the risk of losing control and would
advance soon, obtaining even more Beyonder powers. That was
something anyone would be happy and excited about. But he was
also frustrated, as it disrupted his plans and schedules.
Considering the fact that he still had to stay with the Tingen
Nighthawks for some time, Klein thought that secretly advancing to
Clown wasn’t the wisest choice. If he did so, he would be constantly
worried about being exposed, and he would be unable to use his
abilities when there were missions, making it even more dangerous
for himself.
He planned to learn from Spirit Medium Daly and submit an
application to the higher-ups. He would use his contributions to
obtain the recipe and extraordinary ingredients before oﬃcially
advancing into a Sequence 8 Nighthawk.
But there was a diﬀerence between grasping a potion in a month and
in a year. Klein could bear the scrutiny of the Holy Cathedral and
become a talent for nurturing, but he didn’t want the higher-ups to
suspect him. He needed to ﬁnd a convincing reason to explain his
circumstances.
He had planned to use the time before the Seer potion was
completely digested to lay some foundations with the Captain. For
example, he would mention that he felt his spirituality become more
active whenever he went to the Divination Club, or pretend to
casually describe the laws of a Seer that he had derived from helping
other people divine their fortunes. He could also mention that he
didn’t hear any voices that he shouldn’t be hearing, or see things that
are not for his eyes.
This way, the higher-ups of the Nighthawks would think that he had
unintentionally learned something from Daly when completing his
“mission” and had done a more thorough job than her.
This would make the higher-ups focus more on summarizing the laws
and discovering the “acting method,” reducing the suspicion placed
on Klein.
That way, I could even help the Captain and the rest learn about the
acting method…Klein added in his heart. He felt that Dunn Smith was
a good captain. He had no glaring ﬂaws other than his poor memory.
Thus, he wanted to reduce the risk of Dunn losing control and make
him more powerful.
Of course, Klein could also choose to apply after a year to avoid any
risks. But the continuous coincidences and the red chimney he saw in
his dream divination gave him no choice but to improve his abilities
as soon as possible.
“I’ll lay the foundation with the Captain three or four times over the
next two weeks before formally submitting my request. At the same
time, I can head over to the underground market to see if there are
any of the necessary extraordinary ingredients. They will probably be
very expensive…” Klein quickly made a decision and focused his
attention once again on the mysticism lessons.
Time passed quickly as lunchtime slowly approached. Old Neil
ﬁnished his coﬀee and cleared the stuﬀ on the table as he laughed.
“Your mysticism lessons will come to an end soon. From the test just
now, it would seem that you can create charms for yourself now.”
“That’s my plan for the next few days.” Klein heaved a satisﬁed sigh.
Charms were diﬀerent from the protective amulets he had given
Benson and Melissa. They needed to be carved with the help of
ritualistic magic, and they had certain unique abilities that could be
used in battle.
But a low-grade charm couldn’t do everything. The spirituality it
contained would decrease over time and had to be renewed once
every two weeks. Also, he needed to activate them with speciﬁc
incantations; it was impossible to use them at will.
Furthermore, the charms wielded by the Nighthawks were still
limited to the “domains” of the Evernight Goddess. Klein could only
make three diﬀerent kinds of charms for the time being. The ﬁrst was
the Slumber Charm, and its eﬀect was similar to Dunn Smith’s and
Leonard Mitchell’s ability to put someone to sleep with their singing.
The second was the Requiem Charm, which was able to soothe
ghosts, souls, zombies, and the like. It could also deal with vengeful
and evil spirits to a certain extent. The last was the Dream Charm; its
abilities allowed the wielder to enter the dream of someone else.
These abilities were similar to the abilities of the Midnight Poet and
Nightmare from the Sleepless Sequence, so Dunn and Leonard had no
use for these charms. Corpse Collector Frye, Sleepless Royale, and
Kenley would bring one or two along with them, but they hadn’t
needed them in a long time. They frequently brought their charms
back to Old Neil so he could “recharge” them.
Old Neil glanced at Klein and smiled.
“I remember you saying that you practiced a lot this month and have
run out of materials. Are you going to the underground market?”
Klein was taken aback at ﬁrst before he nodded with a pained heart.
“Yes.”
He clearly knew the prices of the ingredients. He could only hope
that he succeeded in making the charms on his ﬁrst try instead of
wasting materials…
After being presented with the mission of bringing lunch
underground, Klein put on his jacket and hat before returning to the
Blackthorn Security Company on the second ﬂoor with cane in hand.
As he walked past the entertainment room, he saw that Leonard and
the rest had already returned and were enjoying their lunches.
Knock! Knock! Knock! He knocked on the Captain’s door.
“Please come in.” Dunn’s mellow voice sounded.
Klein pushed the door open and took oﬀ his hat.
“Captain, did you catch Instigator Trissy?”
Dunn rubbed his temples and shook his head in exhaustion. “We
didn’t ﬁnd her at Tingen Station, but according to the telegraph we
received from Backlund, a passenger saw her in the ﬁrst class
carriage of the earliest train. Regrettably, she got oﬀ in the middle of
the journey.”
“How regrettable.” Klein sighed even though he had expected this.
“Divination isn’t all-powerful…”
Dunn’s gray eyes swept past him.
“There’s no need to be depressed. It isn’t easy to capture a Sequence
7 Beyonder. At the very least, we disrupted Trissy’s evil ritual and
saved at least forty innocent lives. Furthermore, we understand her
situation now. She can no longer commit crimes as she wishes.”
“If she tries to do something similar, she’ll be noticed, discovered,
and reported at any time. Sooner or later, she’ll be captured by the
Nighthawks, Mandated Punishers, or the Machinery Hivemind. It’s
even possible that she’ll be killed.”
“Let’s hope that is the case. May the Goddess bless us.” Klein drew
the crimson moon on his chest.
Following that, he paused and pondered over his words.
“Captain, I haven’t heard unwanted voices or seen unwanted visions
for over a week now. Also, that’s true even when I am in Cogitation
or using my Spirit Vision.”
“Really?” Dunn creased his brows, puzzled.
Klein immediately elaborated, “I feel that I’m not far oﬀ from
achieving full control over the Seer potion. This could be due to my
frequent visits to the Divination Club and helping others tell their
fortune.”
“… Why do you think so?” Dunn immediately changed his seating
posture, his expression lost.
Klein added a stammer into his sentence. “E-every time I head to the
Divination Club, I can feel my spirituality becoming more active, and
every time I help someone divine something, my heart, body, and
soul become more relaxed. I’ve also come up with a set of, well, a set
of rules for a Seer. I’ve been following it strictly, just like how a
Mystery Pryer can “do as you wish, but do no harm.” I found
inspiration from this maxim and tried coming up with a maxim
designed for Seers.
“I think that this might be an eﬀective way to help Beyonders gain
control over their potions faster and reduce the risk of losing control.
Just like Madam Daly who has always been a Spirit Medium.”
It was unknown when Dunn had taken out his pipe. He placed it at
his nose and took a whiﬀ, seemingly forgetting about Klein as he
thought for a few minutes.
“A remarkable guess, and an interesting trial…”
Klein had only wanted to brieﬂy mention it this time around to set up
an underlying reason, so he did not say anything further. He switched
to a half-joking tone and said, “Perhaps I’ll be the fastest Nighthawk
in history to gain control of a Sequence 9 potion.”
“May the Goddess watch over you,” Dunn blessed him, not taking
him seriously. He then slipped into deep thought once again.
Witnessing this, Klein turned around and said his goodbyes before
leaving the Captain’s oﬃce.
He was closing the door to the room when he suddenly thought of
another diﬃcult question. How in the world was he going to act as a
Clown!
Must I join a circus? There are no ﬁxed circuses in Tingen, they’re all
roaming ones…Klein’s expression became a little bitter.
Being a Seer was still a rather respectable occupation. Klein would
still be able to hold his head up high even if he was spotted by
someone he knew. But if he became a Clown, there was no way his
reputation would hold!
Perhaps there are other ways of acting as a Clown. There were no circuses
or clowns when the Blasphemy Slate was revealed to the world… Forget
it, I won’t have the chance to advance for another two or three weeks, so
there’s no need to deliberate over this for now. Klein avoided the
question and headed to the reception area. He walked toward
Rozanne, Mrs. Orianna, and Bredt to fetch his and Old Neil’s lunch.
Chapter 128: The Impoverished
Fool
After eating lunch, Klein only rested for half an hour before he
rushed to the Shooting Club to practice with his revolver. He didn’t
dare to relax, not one bit.
After practicing his shooting skills day after day and expending more
than a thousand bullets, he was ﬁnally shooting well enough to earn
Dunn Smith’s basic approval. He was pretty good at ﬁxed-target
shooting.
After practicing for a while, he put away his revolver and took the
public carriage to a stop close to the house of his combat teacher,
Gawain. Then, he walked for ten minutes before arriving at the door.
He changed into his knight training suit that had been left to dry in
the sun. After running, skipping rope, lifting weights, squatting, and
other exercises, not to mention footwork and punching training, he
was covered in sweat and felt exhausted.
“Take a break for ﬁfteen minutes.” Gawain’s blond white hair and
deep facial lines made him look hard and stern. He took out his
pocket watch and ﬂipped it open to glance at the time.
Since they ﬁrst began training, he had ultimately maintained his
silence. He only spoke to Klein when there was a need to switch
training methods or to correct one of Klein’s mistakes whenever one
arose.
Klein panted for air, but he didn’t dare to rest straightaway. He paced
back and forth slowly. The most direct feedback of his combat
training was that he was much tanner. His skin had turned bronze
under the sun.
Gawain put away his pocket watch and stood next to the crude
training ﬁeld behind his house. He crossed his arms as he watched
Klein cool down. He was as quiet as a marble statue.
“Teacher, besides ﬁghting with ﬁsts, would you teach me how to use
a straight sword, broadsword, rapier, and spear?” Klein asked
proactively. He was in a good mood, as he had just digested the Seer
potion.
He had seen weapons like the straight sword and rapier in Gawain’s
collection room before. There was also chest armor and full body
armor. He knew that Gawain wasn’t only good at ﬁghting hand-to-
hand.
Bathed in sunlight, Gawain swept his gaze at Klein. He lowered his
voice and replied, “It’s useless for you to learn any of those. Those
weapons have all fallen behind the times, and their only place is in
museums or the private collections of collectors…”
He fell silent for a few seconds before adding with a voice that had
experienced the vicissitudes of life, “They have been eliminated…
You should focus on guns. Even combat is merely supplementary.”
Klein looked at his listless teacher and chuckled as he spoke.
“I don’t think so.”
“Every minister, every Member of Parliament, every general,
everyone of them thinks so,” Gawain said, clenching his teeth.
Klein stopped and acted like he was a true keyboard warrior. He
responded with ease and ﬂuency, “No, they have merely retreated
from the front lines of a battleﬁeld. They still have their uses
elsewhere.
“Why does combat have to be used against ﬁrearms? They could be
used together. I believe a person who is more ﬂexible, swifter in
action, and quicker in response could use guns in a more eﬀective
manner.”
When he saw Gawain’s eyes suddenly sharpen, Klein turned smug
and continued, “The other weapons aren’t eliminated either. They
only need some enhancement to be more portable…”
“… We could form a squad with high maneuverability. A group that’s
designed to circle the front lines and launch an attack from behind
the enemy and ﬁght right to their core. In such a small-scale surprise
attack, a warrior who has outstanding hand-to-hand abilities and
familiarity with various kinds of weapons could play an important
role. You can imagine such a scene…”
Klein gave full play to his ability of knowing a bit of everything. He
mixed and matched all the combat tactics the special forces on Earth
had and described them to his teacher.
He wasn’t sure when Gawain’s breathing became heavier. He stood
there without moving an inch, seemingly unwilling to break the
scenes he imagined.
Klein stole a glance at the man’s reaction. He felt smug in his head as
he cleared his throat and said in a restrained manner, “Teacher, what
do you think about my plan? Is there any possibility of realizing it?”
Gawain’s body quivered as though he just awoken from a dream. He
looked deeply into Klein’s eyes and said, “Your break is doing you
well. Repeat the whole set of exercises ten times.”
Huh? Klein looked lost.
Very soon, he started running and snapped back to reality. He roared
in his heart, Ten sets? Teacher, no!
I don’t want to celebrate my complete digestion of the Seer potion
like this!
Hey, didn’t you gain any inspiration at all? …
Looking at Klein running towards the other side of the training ﬁeld,
Gawain suddenly uncrossed his arms and covered his face with one
hand.
He closed his eyes tightly, and the wrinkles on his face were deep and
obvious.
…
After nearly puking from exhaustion, Klein took a shower, changed
clothes, and bade a still silent Gawain farewell. He took the public
carriage and left.
He didn’t return home directly but headed to Evil Dragon Bar near
the harbor. He planned to inquire about the price of Beyonder
ingredients and buy items for making charms.
On the way, Klein kept his mind on his tiny stash that he was
carrying with him. He forced himself to stay alert and reached his
destination with great diﬃculty.
“I need to save four pounds for the remaining balance that I owe to
the detective company. I can only use three pounds and ﬁve soli
tonight…” He touched the paper notes in his pocket before grabbing
his cane and alighting the carriage.
At that moment, the sun had already begun slipping below the
horizon. All the houses were gradually tainted with a twilight luster.
The boxing matches and rat-baiting with dogs were already warming
up in Evil Dragon Bar.
After passing through the billiard room and numerous rooms, Klein
ﬁnally entered the underground market.
He looked to the left and right, but he didn’t see Monster Ademisaul
who was always active around there.
“Didn’t Old Neil say that Ademisaul only managed to survive because
the boss of Evil Dragon Bar feeds him?” Klein asked himself
curiously.
As a Nighthawk, he remained vigilant to matters like that. He
approached the brawny man guarding the door and asked, “Where’s
Ademisaul?”
The brawny man replied without a smile, “I have no idea where he’s
sleeping. He’s been like that lately. He lies down in shivers and
chants ‘Dead, dead, all corpses, everyone has to die.'”
What scenes did he see this time? What triggered him? Klein creased his
eyebrows slightly and asked for more details. He wanted to know
where Ademisaul was sleeping, but the guard didn’t know either.
When I’m done, I’ll look for him via divination to see what he’s been
through… After taking note of this, Klein walked towards one of the
two rooms at the end of the trading market.
According to Old Neil, the room on the left was for loans and
repayment, while the room on the right was for the buying and
selling of precious items, including Beyonder ingredients.
When he opened the door to enter the room on the right, Klein
realized that there was a partition that separated it into two spaces,
the inside and the outside. There were another three customers
waiting on the outside.
He lowered his silk top hat and queued behind the three customers.
He leaned his body forward and supported himself with the cane as
he waited in silence.
Soon, the door of the partition opened and a customer in a bluish-
gray harbor worker uniform came out. He kept his head low and left
in a hurry.
Klein lightly clicked his left molar twice and looked at the man with
Spirit Vision. He then looked at the other three customers. There was
nothing wrong with them other than the usual minor illnesses that
people had.
After another ten plus minutes, it was ﬁnally his turn.
He opened the door and entered the room that was lit with a
kerosene lamp.
He locked the door and took the seat that belonged to the customer.
He looked towards the old man wearing a black felt hat opposite him.
“I’d like to know what Beyonder ingredients you have, and at what
prices they are being sold.”
The cheek muscles of the elder were droopy and the wrinkles at the
corner of his eyes were deep, but his body was well-built. He didn’t
ﬁnd Klein’s request weird because many customers weren’t willing to
let another person know what they wanted to buy before they
conﬁrmed that the seller had it available. Generally, they wished to
be introduced to all options.
The old man ﬂipped to the newest pages of the notebook, stole a
glance at Klein, and took a sip of his honey wine before he said,
“Water Ghost’s brain tissue costs from three to ﬁfteen pounds
depending on how intact it is. Star Crystal, 150 pounds per 50 grams.
200 pounds for one Queen Bee Grass. 170 pounds for an adult black-
spotted frog… 280 pounds for Human-faced Rose, but there’s only
one…”
Klein controlled his emotional response. After he listened to the old
man’s introduction, he was surprised that an underground trading
place like this had fewer than thirty Beyonder ingredients.
As he touched the notes worth seven pounds in his pocket and
thought of Miss Justice’s attitude towards a thousand pounds, he
sighed.
“Unfortunately, there is nothing I want.”
Without waiting for the elder to pose any further questions, he
quickly turned around to open the door and made an exit.
He returned to the underground market and looked around blankly.
He stood there for a while and sighed with a bitter smile.
I’m probably the poorest boss among all the secret organizations… That
only steeled his resolve of getting ingredients internally from the
Nighthawks or through exchanges with Justice or The Hanged Man.
After circling the underground market twice, Klein picked and
purchased ingredients to make charms, such as a partially-ﬁnished
silver piece, herbal powders needed for rituals, and natural ores. He
spent one pound and ﬁfteen soli in total.
My private stash of money only has ﬁve pounds ten soli left. Excluding the
ﬁnal payment to the detective, I still have one pound ten soli… After
Klein silently did the math regarding his ﬁnancial situation, he felt
helpless.
Of course, he knew very well that he had only been working for just
over a month. If the time span had been extended to a year, he
should have been able to save up more than a hundred pounds.
“In another two weeks, I’ll have to tell Benson and Melissa that I’ve
gotten a raise to three pounds. We can hire a maidservant, but I
won’t have a private stash of money anymore…” Klein thought as he
walked towards the exit of the underground market.
Just then, he saw Old Neil in his classic black robe entering slowly.
“Got everything?” Old Neil greeted with a chuckle.
“Yes,” Klein answered frankly.
Old Neil tsked immediately. “You came really early.”
“That’s because I’m still hungry, but you’ve already had your dinner.”
Klein chatted casually with Old Neil.
After a while, the boss of Evil Dragon Bar, Swain, walked in with his
navy oﬃcer uniform draped over him. He approached the two of
them with a mask of solemnity and lowered his voice.
“I need your help.”
“What happened?” Old Neil suddenly turned serious, and Klein
couldn’t help but feel a tug at his heartstrings.
Swain’s brown hair was messy, and there was a strong smell of
alcohol in his breath. He replied in a low voice, “A member from the
Mandated Punishers has lost control nearby. We have to ﬁnish him
before he harms any commoners!”
Chapter 129: Rampager
Lost control? Klein’s heart tightened as he nearly blurted out his
question.
Even though Dunn and Old Neil had frequently emphasized the
possibilities of losing control and the harm it caused, this was the
ﬁrst time he was experiencing an incident like that. He felt a little
horriﬁed, a little lost, a little scared, and a little saddened. He felt
extremely mixed emotions.
“Among the cases that we… have to deal with annually, a quarter of
them were a result of Beyonders who lost control… And among the
quarter of cases, a large number of them are our teammates.” Dunn’s
words ﬂashed past Klein’s mind, slowing his reaction.
Old Neil, who had experienced many incidents like this, immediately
asked, “Where is the Rampager? What do you need us to do?”
Klein was taken aback from hearing this. He had believed that a
sleazy, “half-retired personnel” like Old Neil would ﬁnd an excuse to
reject Swain’s request or extort a huge sum in exchange for his help.
Never did Klein expect Old Neil to participate without any hesitation,
not minding the diﬀerences between Nighthawks and Mandated
Punishers.
Klein suddenly understood something when he looked at the serious
Old Neil. It didn’t matter if they were Nighthawks, Mandated
Punishers, or Machinery Hivemind. Their aim was to stop
supernatural powers from harming the innocent and maintain peace
and stability in Tingen. If they were met with a dangerous and urgent
situation, their sense of duty would propel them to help without
hesitation!
Swain answered succinctly, “Be my support!”
He didn’t explain why the person lost control or where the Rampager
was. Instead, he made his way to the exit quickly.
This ex-captain of the Mandated Punishers was clearly an old
alcoholic, but Klein realized that he could not keep up with the man’s
pace. He needed to break into a jog to ensure that he was not left
behind.
He turned his head to look at Old Neil, only to see the old Mystery
Pryer break into a run.
The three of them didn’t pay any attention to the gazes of the guards
on their way there. One of them had an old navy uniform draped
over him, another was in a dark classic robe, and the other in a black
windbreaker. They charged out of the billiard room and into Evil
Dragon Bar.
The customers who were drinking shifted their gazes from the rat-
baiting competition to Klein and company.
“Is that Boss Swain?”
“Where’s he going in such a hurry?”
“Did someone default on their loan?”
…
Amidst the soft murmurs, some of the customers focused their
attention back to the cage. They once again broke into an uproar,
venting the stresses of their day. However, some of the more
perceptive customers felt a faint sense of unease.
Tap! Tap! Tap!
Klein, Old Neil, and Swain ran across the road and entered the harbor
district.
“On that boat.” Swain slowed down and pointed at a cargo ship not
far away. “Two Mandated Punishers are circling the Rampager,
preventing him from entering the Tussock River. Help me inﬂuence
him and bring him under control. Leave the rest to me.”
Old Neil panted for air and said, “Alright, b-but you have to give me
a minute. Phew, a minute to recover.”
Swain nodded and didn’t say any more. He charged up to the ship
and joined the ﬁght.
Upon hearing the sounds of combat on the ship, Old Neil looked at
the somewhat nervous Klein. He took out a piece of silver about the
size of a baby’s palm from a hidden pocket near his waist. He then
passed the silver to Klein and said, “Slumber Charm. The incantation
to activate this amulet is the phrase ‘Evernight’ in ancient Hermes.
After you ﬁnish the incantation, inject your spirituality into the
charm and then throw it at the target after three seconds.”
“Alright!” Klein extended his hand to receive the charm and felt
moved.
This charm was carved with Hermes incantations on both sides, as
well as the corresponding symbols, Path Numbers, and the spell’s
characteristics. He didn’t need to activate his Spirit Vision to feel the
deep, serene power ﬂowing within the charm.
Old Neil stood up straight and took out a similar charm from his
hidden pocket and held it in his palm. He joked as he walked toward
the cargo ship, “Do not be too nervous, relax and think about
something else. For example, I lent you that charm. If you’re going to
use it, remember to make one for me in return. Of course, you can
wait till next month, when you receive a new quota of materials
before you do so.”
This… He really is the experienced Old Neil… Klein placed the charm
into his left pocket, reached into his holster, took out his revolver,
and adjusted the hammer and drum.
“I don’t feel that nervous anymore…” He had a gun in one hand and
his cane in the other. He made his way up the steps with Old Neil
and boarded the cargo ship.
This cargo ship had obvious signs of age. Although it was powered by
steam and had a chimney, it retained its past ﬁxtures such as its mast
and sails. Furthermore, only its surface and some other portions were
plated with metal; the remaining sections of the ship were still made
of wood.
As the sounds of the battle intensiﬁed, Klein and Old Neil suddenly
heard a loud noise amid the din while searching for a way to enter
the cabin.
The wooden cabin was instantly shattered, its fragments ﬂying
everywhere. A ﬁgure fell through the hole and crashed onto the side
of the ship.
Klein didn’t have the luxury of time to evaluate the man’s injuries.
His gaze was focused on the monster which was charging towards the
hole.
The monster was over 1.8 meters in height and was wearing a
tattered shirt and trouser. Its ankles were covered with dark green
scales, and a layer of skin had formed between its ﬁngers and toes, as
if they were the webbed limbs of an aquatic creature.
It had a head covered in wrinkles, still barely resembling a human. Its
scales were coated with a sticky ﬂuid that continuously dripped onto
the ﬂoor.
Sizzle!
The sticky dark-green liquid corroded the deck slightly, leaving
visible marks behind.
Bam! Swain punched the monster from the side, causing it to stagger
two steps to the side.
Bam! Bam! Bam! Even with the ridiculous muscles Swain had, he was
clearly inferior to the monster. Despite having his punches and kicks
connect, they were unable to smash through its scales and cause
physical harm. Swain was momentarily reduced to a wretched state
as he staggered.
If not for Swain’s astounding sense of balance and the eﬀorts of the
other Mandated Punishers to shoot and suppress the monster, Klein
suspected that this blue-eyed elder would’ve been beaten to death by
the monster.
Thud! Thud! Thud! Swain took multiple steps back, then advanced
once again, like a moth to a ﬂame.
But Klein could sense that he was accumulating something, waiting
for something.
Bam!
Swain was sent to retreat, his body obscuring another Mandated
Punisher’s ﬁeld of vision.
The monster took this chance to charge towards the opening.
It wanted to escape the ship and jump into the Tussock River!
Looking at the wrinkled, sticky head of the monster, Klein lifted his
right hand and pulled the trigger.
Bang!
The silver demon hunting bullet hit the monster’s body just as he
predicted. But it had only hit its scales and failed to fully penetrate its
body.
The monster let out a ear-piercing shriek before it exerted strength
with its feet and pounced at Klein.
When a stinking ﬁshy smell hit him, Klein suddenly hunched down
and rolled to the side.
Clang! He felt the ship shake as fragments had hit it as well.
At the same time, he heard an old but deep voice recite an
incantation in ancient Hermes, “Evernight!”
Klein rolled over two more times. He couldn’t care about his cane as
he lifted his head and revolver in a ﬂuster. All he saw was Old Neil
tossing out his charm calmly, despite being incredibly close to the
monster.
The piece of silver was instantly swallowed by a dark red ﬂame and
released the faint sound of an explosion.
A deep, serene power spread forth. The monster, who had almost
destroyed the side of the shop, rocked. Its movements became
sluggish.
Swain charged out from the cabin. He approached the creature and
pulled back his arm, hitting the monster like a jackhammer. His
punches connected with the head of the monster.
But he could barely inﬂict a wound, let alone cause any fatal damage.
But Klein could sense that whatever the blue-eyed elder was
accumulating had ﬁnally reached its peak.
Boom! The monster seemed to recover. It ﬂailed its arm and made
Swain take ﬁve steps back in retreat. Each of his steps caused cracks
to form on the deck.
Seeing that the monster was about to turn around and jump oﬀ the
cargo ship, Klein took out the Slumber Charm from his pocket in a
hurry.
After which, he expertly recited the phrase in Ancient Hermes,
“Evernight!”
Suddenly, Klein felt the silver charm in his hand turn ice-cold, as if it
was made from snow.
He didn’t think too much about it. He injected his spirituality into the
charm, then pulled his arm back before throwing it forward, sending
the charm ﬂying towards the monster.
Meanwhile, the ﬁsh-and-human monster had jumped into the air.
The dark red ﬂames illuminated the surrounding darkness and the
faint explosion was like a prelude to a slumber as it quickly radiated
outwards.
Bam!
The monster fell onto the dock, squirming into a ball. It was
temporarily in a half-asleep state.
Klein was just about to rush to the side of the boat and shoot at the
monster’s head when he suddenly saw Swain charge out and jump
over, his navy uniform already long gone.
He changed his posture in the air, his muscles tightening.
Using his spiritual perception, Klein could feel something that had
been suppressed erupt. Swain descended from the sky and slammed
into the body of the monster. He then straightened his back and
landed a heavy ﬁst on the head of the monster.
Crack!
The monster’s skull shattered into pieces. Dark red blood and grayish
brain matter laced with the green sticky liquid splattered all over the
ground.
“This is one of the abilities of a Folk of Rage?” Klein muttered to
himself as he stood near the broken side of the ship.
Old Neil held his left arm and leaned over to look at what had
happened below.
At that moment, Swain was standing straight. He stared at the
monster under his feet that had just lost its life.
He took out a metal ﬂask and opened the lid. He drank a good half of
the liquor before tilting the ﬂask, pouring the remaining liquor onto
the monster.
After ﬁnishing this, Swain looked like he had aged considerably, his
back hunching a little.
Old Neil sighed as he looked at the scene below. He whispered to
Klein, “I know this Mandated Punisher who lost control. He had
followed Swain for almost thirty years, once clearing water ghosts
who had been killing people on the shore. He also captured evil
Beyonders who were trying to escape through the Tussock River…”
He didn’t continue, but Klein understood what he wanted to say: A
guard who had made many contributions and killed countless
monsters ended up becoming a monster himself.
This was not an isolated incident. It was a possible outcome that
many members of the Nighthawks, Mandated Punishers, or
Machinery Hivemind would one day face.
Hi, CKtalon here, the translator of LoM. I’ve included the author’s
notes before the book went Premium in China below.
It has been two months since LoM was ﬁrst released, and it’s time to
go Premium.
In the past two months, I nearly didn’t say much in the Author’s
Notes or interact much with you. The main reason is that I’m
increasingly convinced that the best communication between author
and reader is inside the novel. I will write whatever I wish to express
or describe inside the story, so there’s no need for me to say anything
else.
Yes, back to LoM, I probably had this idea to ﬁnd the joy from ﬁrst
coming into contact with web novels. That feeling of “wow, there can
be such a world” or “there’s actually such a magical world.”
Back then, every book presented a variety of diﬀerent and interesting
worlds. It always exposed me to more, making me unable to extricate
myself from those worlds as they expand my imagination. Of course,
it has to do with me having little exposure to similar novels.
Therefore, when I felt that I had made suﬃcient preparations in
creating the framework of a relatively new world and an interesting
and amazing system, I began this book with uneasiness and courage.
With “acting” the 22 Pathways as core, with 220 potions and 220
“jobs,” this is a part that I hope the most that can interest everyone.
In addition, it mixes in Cthulu mythos, SCP Foundation elements, and
the vibes of the ﬁrst Industrial Revolution’s era and a steampunk
world.
I read many books and created many settings, but I know that what’s
most important is to carefully tell this story. I took my time to tell it,
which is why the ﬁrst volume’s pace is extremely slow. It’s also why
chapters consisting of more than 410,000+ Chinese characters
(255,000+ English words) were released free. I wanted to honestly
develop the plot and accentuate the characters to portray the world. I
didn’t seek so-called climaxes and presented the scenes in my heart to
you.
Thanks to MAM’s writing, I was able to have standards that can
attract others when writing slice of life parts, allowing me to be
equipped with the ability and writing ﬂair needed to honestly tell a
story.
In the past, I learned how to express, or it could be said that every
writer or author can innately express. But now, I feel that I’ve begun
restraining myself. Many a time, I would not describe it, but use
actions, speech and expressions to present the emotions, without any
inner monologue. I might not even use actions, speech, and
expression, just describing it coldly, like the chapter with the female
lead workers. It’s also my wish to maintain standards at critical
points in LoM.
This book’s various frameworks are probably the most complete one
among all my books. Look forward to how I handle everything.
This is my thoughts and attempts for this book. I hope everyone will
like it. I wish you can support me by paying for Premium chapters;
after all, I still need to make a livelihood. I still need to meet the
demands of my wife…
I’ve always been a normal person, and I’ve never had any doubts to
that. At the same time, I’m also a person whose very lazy and have
many personality problems.
I once thought of organizing my own fan club like other authors, but,
aiyah, it’s really frustrating and tiring. Then, there was no more
‘thens.’
I once thought of having a Weibo <sup>1</sup> to amass some
popularity, but, aiyah, it’s really frustrating and tiring. Then, there
was no more ‘thens.’ I’ve already lost track of the last time I updated
on Weibo.
I made a public WeChat account and attempted writing somethings,
but, aiyah, it’s really frustrating and tiring. Then, there are updates
only once in a while.
I attempted to hire others to help me run the social media account,
but I always ﬁnd it awkward and embarrassing seeing the content
posted by others. So, I stopped it.
Phew, I wish to be a mediator for myself. Admit it, you are a lazy
person. You are a person who is ﬂawed when it comes to social
interactions. You are a thin skinned person who wants face at the
cost of your life. You are a person who doesn’t like getting disturbed
by various miscellaneous matters. You are just like it is to wash a pig
is to waste both water and soap.
Perhaps, what I can do well and am willing to do well is to write
novels, the depiction of the story in my heart.
That is how I reconcile with myself, not to live on awkwardly or force
myself to become popular. For the public account, I’ll post something
when I think of it. If there’s nothing, forget it. Well, reconciliation is
just an artistic way of saying convincing. The accurate description
should be to live in self-abandonment. *Rubs hands nefariously.*
After this communication, we will have Premium chapters for the
next update. I’ll make my plea here for you to support Premium and
vote with your Power Stones. There will be a mass release! Really, I
have a stockpile!
Well, there will at least be 5, maybe 6!
Chapter 130: Backlund's Secret
Gathering
Klein looked at Swain standing before the monster’s corpse before
looking sideways towards the Mandated Punisher who was helping
his semi-conscious partner up by the arm. Klein suddenly felt an
indescribable sadness.
It was almost impossible for members of the Nighthawks, Mandated
Punishers, and the Machinery Hivemind to be known as heroes. The
things they did were never made known to the public but only
hidden in conﬁdential dockets. But the danger and pain they endured
were ever so real.
Perhaps there would be a day when my enemy will be one of my
teammates… Klein sighed silently. He felt the heavy weight that all
Nighthawks, Mandated Punishers, and Machinery Hivemind carried.
At that moment, Old Neil let out a sigh.
“Let’s go. Let’s not disturb them.”
“Okay.” Klein picked up his cane. Just as he widened his stride, he
suddenly noticed that Old Neil was still holding his left hand. He
asked, concerned, “Are you hurt?”
Old Neil chuckled brieﬂy before saying, “I got stabbed by one of the
shrapnel earlier. If I was still young, I deﬁnitely would’ve been able
to dodge it. Luckily, it’s just a small cut.”
He moved his right hand slightly to let Klein see the tiny wound that
was still lightly bleeding on the back of his left hand.
After he conﬁrmed that it wasn’t a big issue, Klein walked oﬀ along
the gangway as he sighed.
“Mr. Neil, you’re much calmer than I imagined. Despite being less
than two meters away from the monster, you could still chant the
incantation calmly and use the charm.”
Although the rampaging Mandated Punisher had leaped towards
Klein in the form of a monster, Old Neil was physically very close to
him the entire time.
Old Neil chucked at the compliment.
“I’m an experienced Nighthawk. Among the dangerous things that
I’ve done, what happened just now isn’t even in my top ten. Once,
when I was patrolling Raphael Cemetery with Dunn, I had no idea
that a corpse had turned into a zombie and left its tomb to lie in
ambush in the shadows of the trees. I passed by without noticing it at
all since I was looking for some hidden spot. Heh, you know what I
mean. In the end, he leapt onto my back and seized my throat.”
Klein felt gripped by terror when he heard the recollection as he
voiced out his guess.
“And under such a situation, you were still calm enough to use a
charm? Or did you use some spell that a Mystery Pryer could cast
quickly?”
Old Neil stole a glance at him and chortled. “No, Dunn managed to
drag that zombie into a slumber in time. I’m telling you this story to
tell you that, as a Nighthawk, you not only have to believe in
yourself, you also have to trust your teammates too.”
Klein fell silent for a few seconds. Then, he replied both sincerely and
jokingly, “Mr. Neil, you are so wise today.”
Old Neil did a tiny hop and found his footing on the pier. He replied
in disdain, “That’s because you only get to know the most trivial side
of me usually.”
The two of them left the harbor and walked towards Evil Dragon Bar.
Klein put away his revolver, set his cane aside, and took oﬀ his
jacket. Under the light of the gas street lamp, he started checking if
there was any damage to his jacket.
“How lucky. There are only a few splinters and a patch that got
dirtied…” He removed the splinters and roughly patted the dust
away. Then, he put it back on.
Old Neil looked at him with a smile and mimicked his tone by adding
leisurely. “What a pity, there’s no way to claim compensation.”
Klein was temporarily at a loss for words.
I’m not such a person! He emphasized in his heart.
As the public carriage arrived, Klein took out his silver vine-leaf
pocket watch and ﬂipped it open to check the time.
“If there’s nothing else, I have to head home,” he turned to tell Old
Neil.
Old Neil nodded slightly and said, “Enjoy your dinner at home. You
don’t need to think about the Slumber Charm. I’ll get Swain to
compensate me. He’s a rich man after all. Of course, I won’t go today.
I have to consider his mood.”
Klein opened his mouth, but in the end, he only said, “… Thank you
for your generosity.”
He boarded the carriage quickly and returned to Daﬀodil Street. It
was already past seven in the evening, and the sky had already grown
dark.
Klein took out his keys to open the door and saw Melissa taking oﬀ
her ﬁshnet hat and setting it on the clothes rack. He smiled and did
small talk.
“You just got back?”
Then, his mixed emotions suddenly vanished, and he felt relaxed and
warm.
“There was a practical lesson in school today,” Melissa explained
seriously.
Klein sniﬀed and smelled the fragrance of food. He was stunned and
asked subconsciously, “Then, who’s cooking dinner?”
The moment he ﬁnished his sentence, both of them answered the
question in unison, “Benson!”
Their tone had a hint of alarm.
Benson, who had heard their conversation, walked out of the kitchen.
While wiping his hands on an apron, he said, “Do you have no
conﬁdence in my cooking? I remember that before Melissa learned
how to cook, you two would wait for me to come home and watch
me cook with anticipation. Actually, cooking is so easy. You want
potato beef stew? Put in the beef ﬁrst, then the potatoes, then add
some seasoning…”
Klein and Melissa exchanged glances and remained silent.
Putting aside his cane and took oﬀ his hat, Klein turned around and
smiled.
“I think it’s time to hire a maidservant. It’s very unhealthy to not eat
dinner on time.”
“But I don’t want to have a stranger next to us when we chat. That’ll
make me feel uncomfortable,” Melissa said, subconsciously ﬁnding an
excuse to object.
Klein spoke with a smile as he took oﬀ his jacket.
“I don’t mind…”
Just then, his expression froze, and he stopped what he was doing.
I almost took oﬀ my jacket. I still have a revolver at my armpit…
Ahem. He cleared his throat and pretended nothing happened. “Don’t
mind her. When we get home, we can let the maidservant rest in her
room. I doubt any maidservant would dislike resting. Hmm, we must
ﬁnd a maidservant who’s willing to learn how to cook.”
He didn’t want to endure the torture of a cuisine that left him
guessing in the future.
Benson stood at the kitchen and nodded in agreement.
“When we have time, we can go over to Tingen Family Servant
Assistance Association. They have a great deal of experience and
many resources in this ﬁeld.”
“Alright, it’s decided then!” Klein ignored Melissa’s unwilling look.
…
Backlund, Empress Borough, Viscount Glaint’s residence.
Audrey Hall left the party with her personal maid, Annie. They came
to the second ﬂoor and entered the bedroom that the Viscount had
prepared.
She took oﬀ her glamorous dress and her lightweight dancing heels
slowly with Annie’s assistance. She then put on a black hooded robe
that she had prepared ahead of time.
Pulling up the hood, Audrey stood before the full mirror and
examined herself.
She saw that more than half her face was covered by the shadow of
her hood, and only her beautiful lips were clearly exposed.
Long black robe, face hidden by shadows, a mysterious feeling… This is
something I’ve been dreaming of wearing all this time! Audrey thought to
herself happily.
Worried, she added a blue boat-shaped soft hat under her hood. With
the ﬁne checkered ﬁshnet drooping down, her facial features became
even more indiscernible.
“Not bad, that’s it!” Audrey stuﬀed her feet into leather ankle boots,
looked to the side, and told Annie, “Wait for me here. No matter who
comes, do not open the door.”
Annie looked at her helplessly and said, “But you have to make sure
that your trip doesn’t take more than an hour.”
“You should trust me. I have kept my promise every single time in
the past.” Audrey smiled and leaned in towards her personal
maidservant. She hugged her and kissed her cheek as etiquette
demanded.
Then, she walked quickly and pulled up her hood. Turning around,
she exited the bedroom through a secret door.
She walked all the way down and came to the side door of the
viscount’s residence where she saw that there was already a carriage
waiting there.
Glaint stood amidst the shadows as he glanced at Audrey and
complimented sincerely, “By dressing up like this, you are really,
yeah—like the description Emperor Roselle often used—very cool.”
“Thank you.” Audrey pulled up an imaginary skirt and curtsied
elegantly.
The two of them got into the carriage and left the villa. They arrived
at a house about ten minutes away.
Outside the house, Audrey saw Apprentice Fors Wall and her friend,
Tribunal Xio Derecha, whom she had been seeing recently.
Fors’s slightly wavy brown hair and her light blue eyes showed a
natural laziness. She pointed at Xio Derecha next to her and said,
“She’s an excellent persuader, capable of helping you get things that
you want.”
Xio Derecha was slightly shorter, about 150 cm at most. Her facial
features were soft, but she seemed pretty young and immature.
Although her shoulder length blond hair was messy and unkempt,
and she was in a traditional knight training suit, she carried an
indescribable look of dignity and a convincing charm.
Audrey had met her a few times. She smiled faintly and greeted,
“Miss Xio, can I trust you?”
“You don’t have to worry at all.” Xio Derecha smiled and gestured
with her hand.
Just as she walked to follow Audrey and Viscount Glaint, they heard
a sudden thud.
Audrey looked towards the source of the sound and saw that a
triangular blade coruscating with a cold glimmer had fallen beside
Xio Derecha’s leg.
Audrey and Xio Derecha exchanged looks, simultaneously at a loss
for words.
After nearly twenty seconds, Xio Derecha quickly squatted and picked
up the triangular blade and hid it on her body.
“We have to prevent the occurrence of an accident. Some people lack
rationality, and they aren’t convinced easily,” Xio Derecha explained
seriously.
Audrey nodded and replied with a clear voice, “I believe you…”
“These are tools to convince those b*stards to talk to us calmly,” Fors
added, looking sideways at the grass plains.
The quartet didn’t continue conversing and walked a few steps
forward. They knocked on the wooden door with three long and two
short knocks.
The door squeaked and opened. Slowly, using her Spectator state,
Audrey looked into the house that had many people sitting around
randomly. They employed various methods such as hoods or masks to
conceal their looks. Some didn’t even bother and exposed their faces
openly.
Almost instantly, Audrey noticed a black-robed man on a single seat
sofa.
That man wore a hood too, hiding his looks under a shadow.
He looked at all the guests in silence, giving people a feeling that he
was somehow in a commanding position.
He is very conﬁdent, but his gaze is very disgusting. His gaze moved up
and down my body like two slippery tentacles wanting to tear oﬀ my
clothes… Audrey’s senses were sharp. She carefully observed and
made a judgment calmly, but she nearly had goosebumps.
Fors introduced him.
“That’s Mr. A, a powerful Beyonder, the leader of this secret
gathering.”
Chapter 131: Transaction
Mr. A? That sounds more like a code name for a criminal rather than a
powerful man of mystery. It can’t be compared to The Fool at all… No,
only gods or demigods can be compared to Mr. Fool… Audrey felt a
sense of superiority as she thought about this.
She looked calmly at Mr. A and spoke to Fors and Xio Derecha with a
hushed tone, “Are there any stories about this man?”
The hooded Viscount Glaint was equally curious.
Xio Derecha replied sternly, “There were several such incidents in the
past. Sequence 8 Beyonders, some even at Sequence 7, have targeted
and tried to deal with Mr. A, but they’ve all mysteriously
disappeared.”
“So he truly is a powerful Beyonder,” Glaint marveled.
They walked into the room as they spoke. The guards immediately
closed the door behind them.
After adjusting to the gas lamp’s light in the room, Audrey saw two
blackboards with several phrases written across them right in front of
her.
At that moment, Fors, who had an unlit cigarette in her hand,
whispered, “Those are the requests of the members of this gathering.
You should be able to understand that many people do not wish for
others to know what they possess to avoid being a target of greedy
people. Thus, they write their requests, or what they are selling, as
well as the rough price on the blackboards anonymously.”
Audrey nodded. She didn’t care to observe the members of the
meeting; instead, she shifted her gaze to the words on the left board.
“I need a pair of eyes from a mature Manhal Fish.”
“The dust left behind by vengeful spirits, 165 pounds.”
“Three pages from Emperor Roselle’s notebook, 20 pounds.”
Audrey couldn’t maintain the state of her Spectator when she saw
that. She was as shocked as she was excited.
These prices… these prices are too… too cheap! She thought in
excitement and joy.
As she walked, her gaze shifted as she saw other notices.
“Tears of an Infant ﬂower, 200 pounds.”
“Mummy Powder, 10 grams, 5 pounds.”
“Fishman Secretion, 30 ml, 29 pounds.”
“Formula for Sequence 8 potion Sheriﬀ, 450 pounds.”
…
Too… just too cheap! The Beyonder ingredients all cost less than 300
pounds!Audrey’s eyes sparkled as she found a place to sit together
with her companions.
Xio Derecha leaned over and whispered into her ear, “Do you have
anything you want?”
Audrey breathed heavily. Emperor Roselle’s famous quote ﬂashed
through her mind: “I want it all!”
She had two elder brothers, rendering her eligibility to inherit the
aristocratic title and the main portion of the inheritance null. But as a
lady adored by her parents and brothers, she had property, farmland,
pastures, mines, jewelry, stocks, and bonds to her name. Together,
they were valued at 300,000 pounds.
This was a part of her inheritance, but she only possessed them in
name before her father, Count Hall, passed away, or when she got
married. Every year, she received a corresponding amount from a
trust fund.
But even so, she could receive 15,000 to 25,000 pounds a year,
making her one of the richest women among the nobles in the entire
Loen Kingdom.
Of course, she had expenses she couldn’t avoid as a noble. And now
that she was receiving annual payouts, she could no longer pester her
parents for money all the time.
She controlled herself and answered with reservation, “For the time
being, I have my sights on Emperor Roselle’s notebook. I adore him,
and I think that the special symbols and literature he created hold a
mysterious power; it’s just that we haven’t found the correct way to
decipher them.”
Audrey, you are becoming more and more hypocritical… She added in
her heart.
Just as she had said that, a young man in a white shirt sitting near
them stood up excitedly. He agreed with Audrey, “Yes! That’s true!
I’ve ﬁnally met someone who shares the same opinion as me!
“I’m the person with the three pages of the notebook, and I can sell
them to you right now!”
Audrey was at a loss at ﬁrst before she replied with a smile, “Then
please allow me to express my gratitude.”
She took out a pair of 10-pound notes and handed them over to the
man, then received the three pages of Emperor Roselle’s diary in
exchange. Of course, no one here knew that they were part of his
diary, and thus everyone generally called them his notebook.
Audrey ﬂipped through the pages after she received them and
conﬁrmed that the writing was similar to the previous pages that she
had come across.
She put away the diary and asked Xio and Fors softly, “Who can I
look for if the notes are fake? Mr. A?”
“Yes, Mr. A will not allow any fraud to take place in his gathering.
And I could help you mediate this privately too,” Xio Derecha replied
eagerly.
“I understand.” Audrey entered her Spectator state and surveyed the
Beyonders and Beyonders-to-be around her.
There were many people looking over because of the excitement of
the young man just now. They were observing Audrey and Glaint,
some making it obvious while others were more discreet, but Audrey
and Glaint’s hoods covered their features well.
There are sofas and chairs strewn all around the venue, all facing the
board. The material of the furniture is rather normal, indicating that the
person who gathered them here, Mr. A, isn’t a noble and doesn’t care
much about the venue… Yes, with the conﬁdence he displayed, he need
not be overly pretentious with the venue… Audrey looked around and
calmly observed.
Mr. A looks at all the ladies present, his gaze often lingering on those who
have above-average looks… He’s lecherous… Why is he looking at me so
frequently? Can he see through my robe?
Audrey was shocked at this deduction. She felt disgusted, as if she
had just eaten a ﬂy.
But her worries quickly eased, for she noticed that Mr. A was not
looking at her body or the bodies of the other ladies…
This means that his eyes cannot see through fabric directly. His sense of
sight is exceptional. It’s as if he’s observing me at a close distance. With
that ability, the hood won’t achieve much. Audrey calmly observed the
rest of the people engaging in their own deals and got an
understanding of the circumstances of some of the people there.
At that moment, Mr. A’s facilitator walked over and whispered to
Audrey’s group, “You can write your requests on a piece of paper and
pass them to me, or wait till the break later to write whatever you
want to sell on the blackboard in the small room.”
Fors took a whiﬀ of her cigarette and surveyed the surroundings
cautiously. “Have you considered which Sequence 9 formula you
want?”
She had kept her promise and told Audrey and Viscount Glaint about
all the Sequence pathways she knew of.
Audrey pretended to think before saying, “Spectator, I want to
become a Spectator. And, I also want the advancement of Spectator,
the Telepathist.”
She considered the fact that she would have to come into frequent
contact with Fors and Xio Derecha in the future, making it highly
possible that they would realize that she was a Beyonder, a Spectator.
Thus, she decided to take this opportunity to reveal this to them and
completely conceal the fact that the Tarot Club existed.
Even though I’ll be wasting some money, it’ll still be worth it… Audrey
praised herself.
At the same time, she noticed that Xio Derecha was looking at the
blackboards from time to time, her expression was that of desire and
depression.
Xio told me that the corresponding Sequence 8 to Arbiter was Sheriﬀ.
She’s looking at the 450-pound price tag? Well, it’s obvious that she wants
the formula for Sheriﬀ…
She’s already been an Arbiter for more than a year, and she has been
unknowingly acting the role of an Arbiter. Her potion should have been
digested already…
All these details tell me that Xio lacks money!
As Audrey was deducing all of this, Viscount Glaint revealed his
choice.
“Apothecary, I want the formula for Sequence 9 Apothecary!”
Feeling the gazes from Audrey, Fors, and Xio, he explained himself
with a chortle, “To me, health and not having to worry about major
illnesses and harm is the most important thing!”
“A rational decision. I once dreamed of becoming an Apothecary.”
Fors sighed while smiling.
She had a rather languid demeanor.
After making the decision, Audrey and the rest wrote their requests
on pieces of paper and handed them over to the facilitator. They
looked on as the facilitator made his way around the venue and
asked the other participants, collecting several other slips of paper.
This facilitator then shuﬄed the notes and handed them over to his
partner in charge of the blackboards, asking him to transcribe the
information onto them.
“I need the formulas for potions Spectator and Telepathist, the price
will be negotiated face-to-face…”
The facilitator would repeat the request three times after he wrote it
onto the blackboard. If someone was interested, they could apply for
a room in secret. There would be facilitators helping them complete
the deal.
After waiting for a while, Audrey and Glaint didn’t receive a request
for a deal. They were rather disappointed.
At this moment, a facilitator walked over to Audrey’s side and
handed her a folded piece of paper.
“It’s from Mr. A,” the facilitator said softly.
Audrey unfolded the slip of paper and took a look.
“Are you interested in the formulas of other Sequence 9 potions?”
Audrey curled the ends of her mouth disdainfully and wrote on a
blank spot: “I am only interested in Spectator.”
She folded the piece of paper and handed it back to the facilitator,
then watched as he passed it back to Mr. A.
Mr. A took a glance and didn’t say anything, continuing to look over
the rest of the members silently.
But Audrey sharply noticed that he had secretly burned the piece of
paper and allowed the ashes to fall to the ﬂoor.
Fifteen minutes later, Mr. A said, “Now we will have a break. You
can interact with other participants freely.”
At this moment, the young man who sold Emperor Roselle’s diary
approached Audrey and said in excitement, “I have already
deciphered a portion of the Emperor Roselle’s special characters and
tattooed them onto myself, allowing me to gain some remarkable
abilities.
“Are you interested?”
Audrey suddenly recalled that she had asked Mr. Fool if the special
characters in the Emperor Roselle’s diary possessed any unique
abilities. Mr. Fool’s answer was that they were useless unless a deity
suddenly took interest in them.
She looked at the young man in front of her and thought for a
moment. She then probed, “What remarkable abilities?”
The young man answered excitedly, “I have become stronger and
more healthy!”
Audrey looked at him in pity. “I’m sorry, I have more trust in my own
research.”
In the remaining time, she continued observing those who came to
this gathering, but didn’t obtain any more information. All she had
was a rough deduction that some of them were doctors or lawyers,
ordinary occupations.
Audrey and the rest left the venue after another half an hour and
returned to Viscount Glaint’s mansion as they waited till the ball
ended.
Audrey returned home at about 10 that night. She was about to get
her maidservant to prepare some hot water when she saw her dog
Susie shoot her a look.
My dog just shot me a look… Audrey’s emotions became complicated.
Chapter 132: Meeting the
Monster Again
She found an excuse for her maidservant to leave them alone
temporarily. Audrey locked the door and looked back at her golden
retriever, Susie, who she wasn’t sure could still be considered as her
pet.
“You heard… Uh, or came across something?”
Susie sat steadily and howled, reverberating the air around her.
“Yes, I heard the Count’s discussion with a few Members of
Parliament in the study. They said that the King and the Prime
Minister came to a mutual agreement; they will give up their revenge
plan on the Feysac Empire in Balam’s East Coast for the time being.
Where’s Balam’s East Coast?”
Susie’s terrifying speed at grasping Loen made Audrey feel mixed
emotions. She fell silent for a few seconds before she said, “I’ll give
you a map tomorrow…”
“Okay~” Susie replied in delight. “The King and the Prime Minister
believe that presently the most pertinent task is to push for the
reformation, which will allow civil servants to be selected via
examination. They hope to pass the bill through the House of Lords
and the House of Commons before October.”
“Really?” Audrey asked, pleasantly surprised.
That was the ﬁrst matter that she had managed to secretly guide after
she became a Spectator. Turning it into reality would give her a sense
of achievement!
Susie answered frankly, “I can’t give you a deﬁnite answer. This is
just what I’ve heard, I couldn’t even fully understand what they
meant. After all, I’m a dog that just started to learn.”
Audrey was stunned for a moment before she beamed and said,
“Susie, you did well! This is your reward!”
She took out a bag from a lavish cabinet, tore open the seal, and
placed it before Susie.
It was a dog biscuit produced by the Backlund Pet Care Company
which was made of ﬂour, vegetables, meat, and water. It was a snack
that Susie really liked.
Susie sat straight and sniﬀed. She waved her paw, seemingly deciding
how she was to consume it to suit her present identity the best.
After a few seconds, she gave up thinking, adhered to her instinct,
and leaped forward. She grabbed the bag of snacks and ran outside.
She stood on her hind legs and opened the door with one claw. Then
ran out and hid in the shadows and began enjoying her snack.
…
On Sunday, Klein didn’t wake up until the afternoon, because he had
spent the night on duty at Chanis Gate. Klein took the trackless
public carriage and arrived at Evil Dragon Bar.
He had previously planned to use divination to ﬁnd Monster
Ademisaul and determine the reason for his recent oddity. However,
he was interrupted by the loss of control of a Mandated Punisher and
could only reschedule it to today.
He went through the billiard room and entered the underground
market. Klein didn’t need to search for he immediately saw
Ademisaul shivering in a corner.
When the pale-looking young man with black, messy, oily hair sensed
Klein’s approach, he suddenly covered his eyes and leaned against
the wall in an attempt to move towards the side door.
Klein quickened his pace and blocked Ademisaul from leaving. He
tapped the left molars twice secretly.
In his Spirit Vision, Ademisaul’s aura appeared rather unhealthy. All
the colors seemed dim. In other words, although he didn’t have any
major diseases, his body was very weak.
At the same time, Klein realized that vibrant fear and anxiety were
revealed in the monster’s emotions. He had lost almost all of the blue
that represented rational thinking.
The surface of his Astral Projection extended from the depths of his
Ether Body. The color was a uniﬁed, transparent, and colorless, just
like a pure light. Is this the uniqueness of a naturally-born
“Monster”? Klein nodded indiscernibly as he stared at Ademisaul’s
face and said, “What did you see recently? What did you come
across? Why are you hiding in a corner and quivering while saying
that there are all corpses and that everyone is dead?”
Ademisaul lowered his head and looked towards his toes. It seemed
like he didn’t dare to look directly at the person before him.
He was shivering almost violently in his grayish-blue trousers and
ragged linen shirt. He replied in a ﬂuster, “No, I didn’t see anything.
N-no, I only had a dream. There’s blood everywhere in the dream and
corpses scattered everywhere. Haha! Boohoo! I was among the
corpses! I was there! I’m gonna die, I’m gonna die! I don’t want to
die, I don’t want to die!”
He laughed and he cried. His reply confused Klein.
Klein massaged his temples and lowered his voice to ask again, “Why
are you afraid of me?”
Ademisaul was taken aback for a few seconds when he suddenly
squatted down. He yelled in extreme fear, “No!
“No!”
…
Everyone looked over and Klein suddenly felt awkward.
I didn’t do anything to you… Why are you screaming as though something
happened! He laughed dryly. He saw that Ademisaul had curled up in
a trembling fetal position. Besides begging for mercy, he didn’t say
anything else. Klein had no choice but to distance himself and
pretend that he was just passing by.
Hmm, maybe I should ask Mr. Azik for advice. But he just went on
vacation to the northern part of the Feysac Empire last week, and he’ll
only return next Thursday or Friday. Before that, I have to ﬁrst report to
Captain… Klein covered his mouth as he yawned. He turned and left
the underground market.
After he got his salary that week, his private stash returned to eight
pounds ten soli. However, truly rare Beyonder ingredients were so
expensive that he could only window shop. Of course, if he wasn’t
afraid of the high interest, he could get a short-term loan from Swain.
When he exited Evil Dragon Bar and waited for the public carriage,
Klein considered the future developments.
In another week, the twelve pounds from my advance salary at the
beginning will be cleared. The money that I bring home will ﬁnally reach
three pounds a week. Melissa will have no excuse about delaying the
hiring of a maidservant… The other three pounds will remain a secret,
and I’ll save up more money for myself…
And I have to quickly get the Telepathist formula or related clues from
Daxter Guderian. I can use the excuse of giving an underling funds to
exchange it for cash from Miss Justice… This could be done through an
anonymous bank transfer. During the process, I’ll cause interference via
divination. That will be very safe and it won’t reveal my identity…
…
After getting on a public carriage, Klein didn’t head to the Blackthorn
Security Company directly but planned on heading to the Divination
Club for two hours.
It was part of the work needed to foreshadow his digestion of the
potion.
Plus, Klein was now considered famous in the divination industry.
There were returning customers from the past and there were also
referrals. On average, he would have more than ten divinations in an
afternoon.
Hence, even though he only went twice a week, he could still make a
proﬁt of half a pound. To the impoverished Mr. Fool, it was better
than nothing.
Sigh, it’s a pity that I made it sound too good at the beginning and
fostered too perfect of an image. I can’t just change my divination fees as I
wish… While sitting in the meeting room at the Divination Club,
Klein thought to himself helplessly as he drank his Sibe black tea.
With his present fame, people would still seek his services even if he
charged four soli.
However, as a Seer that respected fate, he could only continue to
charge eight pence.
Although Klein had fully digested the potion, he wasn’t willing to
take the risk of going against the Seer principles that he previously
summarized. That included not obtaining excessive beneﬁts from
divination. After all, he didn’t know if it would lead to losing control
or other negative eﬀects.
The conﬁdential information the Nighthawks had didn’t include the
concept of “digesting.” Thus, Klein couldn’t determine if there was
still risks after fully digesting the potion, or if he could do anything
that was against the principle.
Just as he was thinking about these things, the beautiful attendant
named Angelica came in and walked over to him. She leaned down
and softly said, “Mr. Moretti, someone wishes for your divination.
Red Agate room.”
“Alright.” Klein had checked if it was a suitable day to visit the
Divination Club before he came, and he had obtained a deﬁnite
answer from his divination.
He took his silk top hat, exited the meeting room, and saw his
customer that was waiting at the door of the Red Agate Room.
The customer was a maiden around sixteen years old. She was
wearing a light blue ruﬄed dress and holding a gauze hat of the same
color. She had brown curly hair, a cute face with baby fat, and a pair
of beautiful light blue eyes.
“Elizabeth?” Klein recognized his sister’s good friend, Elizabeth, who
studied at the Ivos Public School.
He had once helped pick an amulet for her and also resolved Selena’s
magic mirror divination incident with her assistance.
Similarly, Elizabeth said in pleasant surprise, “Mr. Moretti, it’s really
you? I was wondering if it was you when I saw the name.”
“I am a mysticism enthusiast after all,” Klein explained helplessly.
Then he added, “Don’t tell Melissa. Oh, Selena as well.”
The divination result showed that it was suitable for me to visit the
Divination Club! Why did I run into Elizabeth? He shook his head as
he turned around to open the door to the Red Agate room.
At the same time, he clicked his left molar twice.
They entered the room slowly. After he took the seat of the diviner,
he lifted his head to look towards Elizabeth.
With just one glance, his creased his eyebrows.
There was a faint layer of gloomy green in the maiden’s energy ﬁeld!
A symptom of being haunted by spirits and wraiths… Klein made a calm
judgment and asked directly, “Have you had nightmares recently,
ones with repetitive elements?”
Elizabeth, who had just locked the door and had yet to take a seat,
was dumbstruck. It took her a long time to reply, “Yes… That’s why I
came here to look for you.”
Klein leaned back and asked, “What kind of dream did you have?
When did it start?”
“It began from the last two days of my vacation to Lamud Town. Oh,
our family has an estate there.” Elizabeth was considered half a
mysticism enthusiast, so she had better memories of such situations.
“In my dream, I always run into a knight in full black armor. He
carries a huge broadsword and his face is fully covered by a helmet,
so all I could see is a pair of glowing red eyes. In the dream, he keeps
attempting to get closer to me. Afraid, I run away, but the distance
shortens each and every time…”
Klein thought and asked, “Two or three days before you had such a
dream, did you get in touch with any antiques, ancient ruins, burial
objects, or a mausoleum?”
Elizabeth recalled and answered, “I-I visited a mountain near Lamud
Town. There was an abandoned ancient castle.”
That’s a standard opening of a paranormal novel… Klein lampooned
silently as he pressed on, “Did you leave anything behind in the
castle? Or did you take anything from the castle?”
Elizabeth creased her beautiful eyebrows and answered moments
later in uncertainty, “I got cut by brambles and bled… Does leaving
blood behind count?”
Klein nodded with a mask of solemnity and answered in a deep voice,
“Yes.”
Chapter 133: Expensive Charms
Elizabeth immediately turned nervous after hearing Klein’s reply.
Subconsciously, she began to speak faster.
“Can you help me divine the speciﬁc reason? It will be even better if
you can divine a way to solve this…”
Divination can only give us a general direction of how to solve the
problem, and furthermore, it will be unclear and ﬁlled with symbolism,
making it diﬃcult to decipher the hints correctly… Of course, you’re very
lucky, I’m not an ordinary Seer, I’m a true mysticism scholar! Klein
lampooned the girl’s question before saying solemnly, “Since this
matter has to do with dreams, I would suggest a similar divination
method.”
“Alright, alright.” Elizabeth nodded her head like a hungry
woodpecker.
Klein maintained his professional attitude. “I will need you to sleep
here and allow that dream to present itself. Is that a problem?”
“There’s no problem, I trust you,” Elizabeth answered without
hesitation while pursing her lips.
But she quickly added with a stammer, “B-but, I cannot guarantee
that I would… I would have that dream.”
“It’s just an attempt,” Klein consoled her with a gentle smile.
He then pointed at the long sofa on the side of the Red Agate room.
“Please.”
“No, no need for that, I’ll sleep here.” Elizabeth shook her head
gently. She crossed her arms and said, “I sleep like this at school after
classes whenever I feel tired.”
She used her arms as a pillow and leaned forward onto the edge of
the table.
“Alright, you can pretend that I’m not here.” Klein smiled as he
observed the colors of her aura and emotions. He used them to
deduce if the girl had fallen asleep or not.
“Okay.” Elizabeth closed her eyes and buried her face into her arms,
trying hard to ease her breathing.
Klein didn’t speak as he leaned back into his chair. The room
suddenly became unusually quiet.
It was a peaceful silence, a silence that could make one forget their
troubles.
Sometime later, Klein took out a semicircular piece of silver from his
pocket after he conﬁrmed that Elizabeth had fallen asleep. The piece
of silver was ﬁlled with indecipherable Hermes phrases as well as
symbolic imagery and numbers.
It was a Dream Charm that Klein had succeeded in making the
previous morning!
He had also ﬁnished making two Slumber Charms and two Requiem
Charms. The former were made with rectangular pieces of silver
while the latter were made with triangular pieces. This was to help
him diﬀerentiate between them solely by touch during an intense
battle.
“Crimson!” Klein softly recited the phrase in ancient Hermes.
This was the activation incantation that he had set. Since there was
still the step of injecting spirituality into the charm, there was no
need for his incantation to be diﬀerent from the rest. All it needed
was to be short and easy to remember.
The mysterious incantation reverberated around the room. Klein felt
the Dream Charm become light in his hand, as if it had temporarily
lost its weight.
Klein immediately placed the charm on the table in front of him after
he injected it with his spirituality.
A transparent ﬂame leapt up silently, enveloping the charm and
became a deep, serene black.
The black ﬂames spread quickly, enveloping Elizabeth and Klein.
Klein seized the opportunity to enter his state of Cogitation. He used
his spirituality to look at the illusory spherical light in front of him.
The spherical light was surrounded by a boundless darkness, making
it seem exceptionally lonely.
Klein didn’t dare delay any further as he emitted his spirituality,
allowing it to touch the illusory ball of light.
Silently, the scene around him started to coruscate and warp, but it
quickly settled into a yellowish-brown plain. The plain was littered
with the corpses of horses and humans. Fresh blood and weapons
could be seen everywhere.
Elizabeth was wearing a regal gown with engageantes and a ﬁshnet
hat. She was looking around, lost.
She quickly saw Klein’s ﬁgure and revealed a look of surprise and joy.
“Mr. Moretti, we meet again! I had suspected that the Klein Moretti
on the name register was you when Selena and I came to get a
divination. I came again multiple times, but always missed you as I
had to attend lessons during the day…
“When I was free during the summer break, I was dragged to a
holiday at Lamud Town by my parents…
“You can help me right?”
Klein froze for a moment when he heard the girl’s talkativeness.
To think that Elizabeth had suspected that I was working part-time at the
Divination Club and tried to ﬁnd me on multiple occasions…
Yet, she didn’t appear abnormal at all!
Hmm, her surprise was authentic, masking her true thoughts…
Indeed, everyone’s dream shows their most honest side, other than me,
Mr. Fool.
As he was indulging in his thoughts, Elizabeth’s dream changed. A
tall knight, about 1.9 meters in height, was walking toward them,
dragging a broadsword which was scraped the ground.
This knight was dressed in black armor. The metallic sounds of metal
colliding could be heard with his every step. Two blobs of red light
akin to ﬂames peeked out from the slit of his faceplate; they were
staring at Klein and Elizabeth intently.
The will of a wraith… Still not at the stage of an evil spirit. Klein, who
was in his spirituality state, didn’t need to activate his Spirit Vision.
According to the classiﬁcations based on the Nighthawks’
conﬁdential information, the feelings of vengeance and injustice left
behind by spirits were the weakest and easiest kinds of souls to deal
with. Following those were shadows and wraiths. Evil spirits were the
most diﬃcult soul-like creatures to deal with. The most horrifying of
evil spirits were said to be as strong as High-Sequence Beyonders.
With this in mind, Klein took a step forward, blocking Elizabeth
behind him. He then stomped down with his foot and shattered the
dream.
Multiple specks of light scattered like ﬁreﬂies. Klein’s spirituality
returned to his body, allowing his eyes to once again adapt to the
darkness of the Red Agate room. He saw the tools needed for
divination placed around the table, as well as the Dream Charm that
had almost ﬁnished burning.
Klein felt the pinch when he saw this. Charms in the Evernight
Goddess’s domain were all made using pure silver, so it pained his
heart.
Using these charms is akin to burning money! Even if I don’t account for
my labor costs, the materials alone already averaged to about six to eight
soli per charm!
Well, he felt a little more at peace when he thought of the Beyonders
from the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun. After all, they burned
gold—the corresponding metal for the Sun was gold.
Elizabeth groaned softly and slowly woke up before straightening her
posture.
She glanced furtively at Klein and asked, “Mr. Moretti, were there
any results from your divination?”
“Yes.” Klein nodded seriously. “Your nightmares should disappear in
no more than a week.”
I will report this to the Captain and get him to send someone to deal with
it at Lamud Town… Klein added in his heart.
“Really? That’s great! Thank you Mr. Moretti!” Elizabeth became
excited. She then suddenly creased her brows.
“What’s the matter?” Klein asked in concern.
“Nothing. I just remembered that I have to go home now.” She slowly
took out a single soli bill that she had prepared and placed it on the
table. She then grabbed her hat and bade goodbye to Klein a little
hesitantly.
After leaving the Red Agate room, Elizabeth walked toward the stairs
outside the door. She ﬂailed her arms after she conﬁrmed that no one
was watching and groaned softly, “Pins and needles! How
numbing…”
…
In the Blackthorn Security Company, Dunn rubbed his forehead as he
looked at Klein.
“Did you suddenly return because you came across another
supernatural incident?”
Hey, Captain, what’s with that tone of disparagement… Klein cleared his
throat and answered without hesitation, “Yes.”
“What’s the matter this time?” Dunn Smith rubbed his forehead
again.
Klein organized his words and replied, “Two things. For the ﬁrst
incident, I discovered ‘Monster’ Ademisaul hunched in a corner,
shivering in fear when I was buying materials for my charms at the
underground market.”
When he said that, he hinted heavily that he needed a reimbursement
for the materials.
Klein couldn’t mention the fees for the detective he employed to ﬁnd
Daxter Guderian, for it involved the red chimney. He deeply regretted
not employing separate detectives.
Dunn seemed to fail to read between the lines as he nodded slightly.
“What happened to Ademisaul?”
Klein exhaled silently and described in detail, “Ademisaul had a
dream. He dreamed that there were corpses and blood everywhere.
One of the corpses was his, and thus he became very frightened.”
Dunn thought for a moment before asking slowly, “As a Seer, what
do you think it symbolizes?”
“A disaster. A disaster that spans a wide area. But I have no
information other than this. Furthermore, not everything in
Ademisaul’s dream might have a symbolic meaning,” Klein said while
deliberating his words.
“I will report this to the Holy Cathedral and see what they have to
say.” Dunn shook his head and said in a self-deprecating manner,
“This isn’t something I have expertise in.”
Klein didn’t have any other ideas either. He changed the subject and
spoke about the wraith harassment Elizabeth faced.
“Lamud Town… Is that lady a believer of the Goddess?” Dunn asked.
“Yes.” Klein gave an aﬃrmative answer.
“Then there should be no problems. Let’s head over to Lamud Town
now and try to get dinner there. Oh, and bring Frye along. His
abilities should prove useful if the incident involves corpses and
ghosts.” Dunn massaged his temples and tried his hardest to
contemplate whether he had forgotten anything.
If Elizabeth wasn’t a believer of the Evernight Goddess, then they
would have to hand her over to the Mandated Punishers or the
Machinery Hivemind according to her faith. If her faith didn’t lie in
any of the three major Churches, then she would be handed over to
the Machinery Hivemind who were responsible for the outskirts.
Klein didn’t speak. He waited silently for a while before ﬁnally
hearing Dunn add, “Also, we have three men on the mission. We can
request to use Sealed Artifact 3-0782.”
“3-0782?” After a minute, Klein recalled that the Sealed Artifact was
called the Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem.
This Sacred Emblem’s Beyonder inﬂuence seemed to be able to last a
long time. It had the ability to constantly purify any corpses and
spirits in a ﬁfteen-meter radius. However, it had the drawback of
purifying the soul of a commoner at the same time. Research data
indicated that if a normal human were to stand within its radius for
an hour, they would become an idiot that only knew how to praise
the Sun. The limit for Beyonders was six hours.
As for ghosts and corpses, they would scatter in less than a minute.
Hmm, to think that the Captain would remember the codename for this
Sealed Artifact… Damn, I feel that my memory is worse than his… Klein
suddenly froze, nearly wanting to hang himself.
Dunn Smith leaned back and looked at Klein with his deep gray eyes.
“You went to the Divination Club again today? Did you feel any
changes over the past two days?”
Chapter 134: It's Been More
Than A Minute
Captain, that’s the exact question I wanted you to ask! Klein nodded
seriously.
“I feel even better. I even believe that I can pass the Holy Cathedral’s
examination right now. It’s a kind of feeling and conﬁdence that can’t
be described with words.”
Realizing that his answer could be a little vague, he couldn’t help but
add, “Perhaps the name of a potion is really crucial. When I strictly
followed the Seer principles that I derived and acted as a fortune-
teller, everything became perfect and easy. Yes, I can now activate
my Spirit Vision with an even more inconspicuous manner.”
Dunn creased his eyebrows slightly as the light in his eyes converged,
he muttered seemingly deep in thought,”The name of the potion…”
After about ten seconds, he looked at Klein again.
“Do you need to return and inform your family? Sunday is the second
day after your duty at Chanis Gate. You’re supposed to get some
rest.”
Taking into consideration the fact that Elizabeth was a good friend of
his sister, and that he had promised that the problem would be
solved within a week, Klein answered without hesitation, “We don’t
have to waste time. After we set oﬀ, just get the carriage to take a
turn by Daﬀodil Street.”
“Alright. Get Frye while I ﬁll out the application form to get Sealed
Artifact 3-0782 out.” Dunn pointed at the break room diagonally
opposite.
Frye was a Corpse Collector, so he didn’t possess the abundant energy
of a Sleepless. If he was free, he would take a nap.
Filling in the application form yourself, approving it yourself, and
collecting it yourself… Captain, our management system is quite ﬂawed…
Klein lampooned silently before he retrieved his hat and exited
Dunn’s oﬃce to knock on the door diagonally opposite.
After Klein knocked thrice, Frye opened the door and looked at Klein
with undisguised puzzlement.
“What’s the matter?”
As he was taking a nap, his hair was messy and his shirt was untidy.
His cold and gloomy temperament faded quite a bit.
However, he still looks like a dead person that climbed out of his coﬃn…
Klein hid his smile and answered seriously,
“There’s a case that involves wraiths. The Captain wishes for your
assistance.”
“Okay.” Frye lifted his hand subconsciously to smooth out his messy
hair, returning him to the cold person that kept the living at bay.
After he dressed up, the two of them waited by the sofa in the
reception hall. The surroundings warmed up after another seven or
eight minutes, as though the area was being exposed to sunlight.
Immediately following that, they saw Dunn Smith walk through the
partition while he held in his hand an ancient badge about half the
size of a palm.
The badge had a dark gold luster and was engraved with the
symbolic signs of the Sun and lines that extended to the edge. It was
the Sealed Artifact 3-0782 from the Intis Republic, originally named
the “Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem.”
The Intis Republic was the country that Roselle transformed from an
empire into a republic before turning it back into an empire. Now, it
had established itself as a stable republic and was located on the west
coast of the Northern Continent. Its border with the Loen Kingdom
included landmarks like Midseashires, the Hornacis mountain range,
and so on.
Since the establishment of Intis as a nation, the Church of the Eternal
Blazing Sun had repressed the Church of the God of Craftsmanship
which later became known as the Church of the God of Steam and
Machinery. With it being the main religion of the country, the
country could also be referred to as the Kingdom of the Sun.
“Let’s set oﬀ. Frye, you’ll drive. Cesare can’t withstand the
puriﬁcation of the Sacred Emblem for too long,” Dunn reminded
them calmly.
Cesare Francis was a clerk who was in charge of purchasing and
collecting supplies. He was also their driver, but he was just an
ordinary person. He couldn’t stay more than an hour within a ﬁfteen-
meter range of Sealed Artifact 3-0782. The journey from Zouteland
Street to Lamud Town, according to Klein’s understanding, would
require at least two and a half hours. That didn’t include the time to
detour to Daﬀodil Street.
“Alright.” Frye didn’t object but checked if he had his personal items
with him.
…
When the rays of the setting sun dyed the pinnacle of the town’s
cathedral, the Nighthawks’ carriage ﬁnally arrived at Lamud Town.
The town was located at the northwest edge of Tingen. Many
buildings still had the unique characteristics of the era before the Age
of Steam. There were nearly zero factories and the nearby villages
engaged in commercial trading.
After they stopped the carriage, Dunn looked at the hair salon
opposite and said,
“I asked one of the locals earlier. It only requires a ﬁfteen-minute
walk from here to the castle ruins on the mountain. It’s said that it
belonged to a feudal lord who ruled during the Fourth Epoch.
However, no one knows what happened after that. Of course, their
description is merely a local myth.”
“Yes, let’s go over now and deal with that wraith before the sky turns
dark. Then, we can take turns to watch over 3-0782 and keep it away
from commoners?”
From the moment Dunn retrieved the Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem,
three hours had already passed. It was getting closer and closer to a
Beyonder’s limits. In no time, they would have to part ways and give
each other time to recover.
“Okay.” Frye gave a succinct reply.
“I have no problem about that.” Klein touched the Slumber Charms
and Requiem Charms in his pocket.
The three Nighthawks in thin black windbreakers walked through the
street in the town and headed toward the mountain when they
reached a fork in the road. Along the way, the road was overgrown
with weeds and clustered with shrubs, but it was still spacious
enough to let two carriages pass side-by-side.
It wasn’t long until they saw a collapsed outer wall of an ancient
castle. On the outer wall that was still standing, there were green
plants crawling all over it while the exposed part was mottled.
When he started to get close, Klein could feel a piercing chill as
goosebumps formed all over his arms.
“There really is a wraith,” Frye said monotonously as he looked at
the ancient castle.
Dunn looked sideways to steal a glance at the newly promoted
Nighthawk, then he laughed and said, “Don’t worry. We have both
3-0782 and Frye; the wraith won’t cause too much of a problem.”
He held his custom-made revolver in one hand and the Mutated Sun
Sacred Emblem in the other. He took the ﬁrst step towards the
ancient castle that looked like a ruin.
Klein followed closely behind and prepared to pull the trigger at any
time, swing his cane, or use his charms.
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
When Dunn was less than ﬁve meters away from the ancient castle,
where a broken horse stable, water well, and other ﬁxtures were
reﬂected in Klein’s eyes, a cold breeze howled in a way that could
only be described as sad and shrill. It seemed to be rejecting the
uninvited guests.
The three Nighthawks didn’t stop. The warm and pure feeling
gradually dispersed the chill and conquered the front of the ancient
castle.
They scaled the pile of rocks, passing through the collapsed outer
wall before slowly entering the castle which had lost its main
entrance and was ﬁlled with broken tiles.
The hall of the ancient castle was full of collapsed stone pillars and
was covered with moss. It was spacious, but the windows were
narrow and placed high on the walls. Hence, the lighting was poor. It
looked dim and gloomy inside.
That’s also a trait of buildings from the end of the Fourth Epoch and the
beginning of the Fifth Epoch… Klein, who was a historian, instinctively
made a judgment and activated his Spirit Vision.
Just then, an illusory yet piercing roar suddenly burst out. Suddenly,
from out of nowhere, a thick cloud of black fog ﬁlled the air, resisting
the inﬁltration of warmth and purity.
A tall ﬁgure suddenly surfaced amidst the black fog. He wore full-
body, black armor and carried a broadsword that a commoner would
have found diﬃcult to lift.
The wraith looked identical to the one Klein saw in Elizabeth’s
dream. Two ﬂame-like balls of red light shone through the gap of his
helmet, appearing cold, but they were staring at the three
Nighthawks angrily.
“You have disturbed my slumber! You will have to pay with your
ﬂesh and blood!” He suddenly launched himself forward and
instantly shortened the distance to Dunn. He suddenly slashed
downwards with his broadsword.
Dunn retreated swiftly and lifted his hand to ﬁre his revolver.
Clang!
The silver demon hunting bullet didn’t manage to penetrate the
illusory black armor and only produced a crisp but unrealistic sound.
Klein and Frye retreated to the side simultaneously. One held a gun
in one hand and aimed at the two balls of ﬁre that took the place of
the black-armored knight’s eyes before pulling the trigger. The other
Nighthawk transformed his eyes into a tranquil grayish-white and
focused on the wraith.
The black-armored knight roared in anger again. He took another
huge stride towards Dunn and swung the broadsword horizontally.
Bam!
The broadsword didn’t hurt Dunn, but it knocked him away, causing
him to land heavily by the side of the door. It left him spewing a
mouthful of fresh blood.
With a loud thud, 3-0782 dropped on the ground. Since it was
wearing a metal boot, the wraith eagerly kicked with its right leg and
sent the dangerous badge out the ancient castle’s door. It was a
distance beyond ﬁfteen meters from it.
Klein, who hadn’t managed to shoot the wraith successfully, became
nervous and puzzled when he saw that scene. It was as though he
was overlooking the transformation before his eyes from a calm and
rational position.
Bang!
He ﬁred another bullet. The silver demon hunting bullet hit the
wraith’s helmet and produced sparks. But there was no obvious
damage.
“Right gauntlet!” Frye shouted. He was always cold and gloomy, but
now his tone was ﬁlled with anxiety.
No sooner had he ﬁnished talking, he lifted his revolver as well and
aimed at the wraith’s right metal gauntlet.
Bang! Bang! Klein shot sub-consciously according to Frye’s
instruction, ﬁring silver demon hunting bullets almost simultaneously
with him.
This time, the wraith didn’t block it with his armor but raised his
broadsword and struck the two bullets away.
Bam! He took a stride and charged at Klein, colliding with him
directly.
As Klein ﬂew out, he saw his chest cave in, saw himself spitting
blood, but he didn’t feel uncomfortable, not one bit.
He suddenly snapped out of his daze, fell on the ground, rolled about,
and screamed.
Suddenly, the ancient castle, the wraith, the collapsed pillars, and the
moss ﬂoor shattered eerily. Everything returned to black fog in the
air, just like when the black-armored knight ﬁrst appeared.
The only diﬀerence was that Dunn held both his ﬁsts tightly, bowed
slightly, and his gray eyes were dark and deep.
As expected, everything was just a dream. Captain pulled the wraith, Frye,
and I into his dream at the same time. But I’m special, and I can remain
clear-headed and rational… Klein realized that he was still standing
two meters away to Dunn’s right. He hadn’t vomited any blood or
screamed.
Just then, Dunn stood up straight and looked at the wraith that was
going to slash with his sword. He calmly said, “It’s been more than a
minute.”
The wraith was stunned and let out a shrill cry. Its body started
producing black steam, as though it had just received its death
sentence.
Any zombies or spirits that had yet to turn into evil spirits couldn’t
stay within the ﬁfteen-meter range of the Mutated Sun Sacred
Emblem for more than a minute!
Holy shit, Captain, you’re so cool! Klein looked at the scene from the
side and nearly let out a cheer!
Dunn had used his dream ability not to attack the wraith on his own
turf, but merely to drag out the time!
In the warm and pure feeling, the black steam evaporated quickly
and the chill dispersed gradually. In no time, the knight became
transparent and blended into the void.
Clang!
A black gauntlet fell to the ground, its surface covered with white
frost.
Klein was about to ask for the Captain’s go ahead to pick up the
“drop,” but when he looked over, his spirituality was suddenly
disturbed.
Somewhere near the stairs that separated the hall and the dining hall,
there was an intense yet illusory misery and uncleanliness
summoning him!
Chapter 135: Portrait of a Baron
“There’s some sort of problem there,” Klein said with a serious tone,
pointing at the steps separating the living room and dining room.
He once read in the Nighthawks’ conﬁdential records that if similar
situations appeared in one’s spiritual perception, it usually implied
that there was something evil and corrupted hidden at the target
location. It was best not to interact with it if one wasn’t conﬁdent;
otherwise, one might lose their life. Sometimes, even a mere glance
could result in irreversible damage.
Dunn looked over, and similarly, with his high spiritual perception,
he immediately sensed something wrong. He turned to look at Klein
and instructed calmly, “Divine and see if we would be successful in
our investigation.”
Captain didn’t get me to divine before we entered the castle. He was rather
conﬁdent… That means that he believes that the hidden thing might be
more dangerous than the wraith. Klein nodded in silence. He holstered
his revolver and handed his cane to Frye.
He then released the topaz bracelet within his sleeve, held the silver
chain with his left hand and silently recited a suitable statement.
Instantly, his eyes darkened as a breeze started spiraling around him.
“The investigation of the hidden place in the ancient castle would be
successful.
“The investigation of the hidden place in the ancient castle would be
successful.”
…
After reciting the statement seven times, Klein’s eyes regained their
normal color. He saw the dangling topaz rotating clockwise.
It wasn’t very obvious, but it was unmistakably rotating clockwise!
That meant that the investigation would be successful.
Klein, who was already a true Seer, immediately nodded at Dunn and
Frye.
“The danger will be manageable by us, or there could be no danger at
all.”
Dunn pinned the Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem to the left side of his
chest, then pressed down on his hat. He briskly walked toward the
steps and expertly started searching for a mechanism.
Frye, who had picked up the gauntlet, handed Klein’s cane back to
him. He grabbed his revolver and cautiously scanned the
surroundings, as if he was afraid that an enemy would suddenly
appear.
I’m still not professional enough… as a Nighthawk… Klein geared
himself up and took out his revolver, and turned alert as well.
A few minutes later, it was unknown what the kneeling Dunn Smith
triggered as heavy sputtering sounds emanated from the staircase.
The ﬂoor split open, revealing a set of steps heading down. A cold
and corrupted vibe emanated, seemingly condensing into something
corporeal.
Dunn glanced over and removed Sealed Artifact 3-0782 from his
chest. He tossed it directly into the trap door.
After a few clanks, it was unknown where the Mutated Sun Sacred
Emblem stopped.
If there are dead spirits within, they would deﬁnitely toss 3-0782 back
out… That would be interesting… Klein stared at the stairs and waited
patiently.
The lingering sinister and corrupted feeling soon dissolved away like
snow meeting the sun. Warmness and purity blanketed the entrance
of the trap door.
“Klein, go down with me. Frye will stay here and prevent other
enemies from destroying the mechanism.” Dunn made an experienced
decision.
“Alright.” Klein didn’t shrink back from the task. He took two steps
forward and arrived next to Dunn. Frye nodded, not letting his guard
down.
Dunn went down ﬁrst, his footsteps reverberating in the silence.
He didn’t prepare any sources of light, for a Beyonder that went
down the Sleepless pathway, the darkness was not an obstacle, but a
blessing.
Their vision wasn’t hindered by such an environment.
After taking a few steps down, Dunn suddenly turned around and
looked at Klein. “I forgot that you don’t have night vision. I’m not
used to preparing objects that provide illumination…”
“… Captain, you don’t need to mind about me. I have my Spirit
Vision.” Klein realized that he wasn’t shocked at all.
That cool Captain from before was indeed not normal!
In his Spirit Vision, the darkness before him was screened by a gray
ﬁlm. Even though it was very blurry, it was enough for him to make
out where the steps were.
Well, the Captain sure is healthy, and his mental state is ﬁne too… Klein
carefully extended his feet and made his way down slowly.
The ﬂight of steps wasn’t long. It only took about ﬁfteen steps to
reach the ground.
Sealed Artifact 3-0782 was lying there, releasing its purity and
warmth. It also radiated a faint glow.
Klein could see much more clearly with the help of the illumination.
He surveyed the surroundings and noticed that it wasn’t a huge
basement. It was no longer cold and sinister, but the dampness
remained.
In the middle of the basement was a black coﬃn, with dark red nails
driven into the lid.
The lid of the coﬃn had been pushed open slightly, allowing one to
see a headless corpse that was all bone.
Dunn looked around, then bent over to pick up the Mutated Sun
Sacred Emblem.
“Captain, this coﬃn… It was intended to prevent the dead within
from becoming a zombie or a wraith.”
Klein looked at the dark red nails in the coﬃn and the formation they
were in. He used his decent mysticism knowledge to determine that
this was an ancient ritual to prevent anything the corpse from
reanimating.
At the same time, he muttered inwardly. But under normal
circumstances, who would have nothing better to do than guard against
their loved one from reanimating? Hmm, the people who helped bury the
corpse must not be family… And if they placed the coﬃn in the basement
instead of a tomb, they must have been afraid of someone ﬁnding the
corpse…
Dunn, who had worn Sealed Artifact 3-0782 again, approached the
coﬃn and inspected it.
“The deceased was probably poisoned to death.”
“That means the person who poisoned him must have used ritualistic
magic to prevent him from reanimating and seeking revenge. This
should have happened about 1300 years ago? He became a wraith in
the end… The resentment of this spirit is simply shocking!” Klein also
walked in front of the coﬃn. “Where is his head? That ritual does not
call for the head to be sliced oﬀ…”
Dunn thought for a moment before saying, “I have a deduction. This
wraith didn’t exist all the time and only appeared recently. It’s only a
ﬁfteen-minute walk from the town to the castle. Throughout the
years, troublemakers must have frequented this place, but before this
incident, there were no rumors of there being a wraith in this ancient
castle.”
Klein nodded indiscernibly.
“Captain, what you mean to say is that someone came here recently,
opened the coﬃn, and took away the head of the deceased?”
“Yes, the ritual prevents the corpse from reanimating, but it also seals
and preserves its resentment within the coﬃn. When the coﬃn was
opened and the ritual dispelled, this resentment quickly evolved into
a wraith with the help of its gauntlet…”
“There’s no corpse of the person who opened the coﬃn, so he’s not
an ordinary person… Besides, why did he take away the head of the
deceased?”
Dunn stared at the skeleton in the coﬃn. “For resentment to be
preserved for such a long time, there should be some reason other
than the ritual. He could’ve been a Beyonder when he was alive,
perhaps a descendant one or two generations removed of a Mid-
Sequence Beyonder. I am talking about the Mid-Sequencers as
deﬁned in the past, Sequence 5 or 6.
“And such corpses are always special. His head might be usable in
some kind of ritual or in some other occasion.”
Dunn paused before continuing, “What I said just now was all
conjecture. But we can try to verify some of it. We can split up later
in town and investigate to see if anyone was injured before in their
youth. Well, if they are still alive, it would prove that the wraith only
appeared recently.”
“A logical train of thought,” Klein praised. He quickly searched the
basement but didn’t ﬁnd anything else.
He tried using ritualistic magic to make a sketch of the “guest” that
entered the basement, but because it had been more than a month
since it happened, as well as the disturbed environment due to the
frequent appearance of the wraith, there wasn’t much of a result.
He then took Frye’s place, allowing the expert on the dead to conduct
further tests.
Fifteen minutes later, as the sun was vanishing below the horizon,
Dunn and Frye followed the steps and returned to the hall of the
ancient palace.
Dunn felt for the switch to the trapdoor while Frye gave a short
description, “The deceased was indeed poisoned to death. The traces
near the neck appeared recently, at the very most three months
back.”
This means that it’s highly probable that someone came here before…
Klein nodded in thought.
The three Nighthawks returned to Lamud Town before it got dark
and asked for two rooms at an inn. The member that got the Sealed
Artifact 3-0782 was to take this dangerous item for a stroll outside
the town where no one would be. They would change their shifts
once every two hours, and thus only needed two rooms.
After a simple dinner, Klein, Dunn, and Frye immediately split up and
covered all corners of the town, asking the residents who had lived in
this town for extended periods of time.
In situations like this, their identiﬁcation documents as policemen
proved useful.
…
“Oﬃcer, why are you asking this? I used to head to the abandoned
castle to play when I was young… Injured? Deﬁnitely, how could a
child not have fallen while playing? I remember, yes—I’ve been cut
by a sharp rock on the outer walls of the ancient castle in the past…”
A forty-year-old blond man looked puzzledly at Klein, but answered
his question honestly.
This was the fourteenth person Klein had asked, of which two vividly
remembered being injured in the castle when they were young.
The Captain’s deduction is correct… Klein decided as he put away his
identiﬁcation documents. He smiled and said, “Thank you for your
cooperation, I have no more questions.”
He was about to leave when the forty-year-old man called after him,
“Oﬃcer, are you interested in the ancient castle? I have an oil
painting of the ﬁrst Baron that resided in there. He was the
grandfather of my grandfather of my grandfather… Well, anyway, it
was a long time ago. He took away a oil painting from the castle and
told me that it was the oil painting of the ﬁrst Baron Lamud.
“Do you want it? It’s a true antique!”
If it was a true antique, your family would have sold it a long time ago…
This guy sure is gutsy, daring to fool even the police. Should I scare him
with my gun? Klein lampooned and adopted the attitude of a window
shopper and said,
“Who knows if it’s a real antique or not? I’ll trust my own judgment.
“Take it out and let me see it.”
The blond man smiled and returned to the room and rummaged for
it.
Some time later, he walked out with a oil painting in hand.
Klein casually looked at the oil painting. He saw that the baron had
gentle features and bronze skin, his eyes hiding an indescribable
range of human experience. He was also wearing a white curly wig.
Huh, he looks a lot like Mr. Azik! Klein’s eyes suddenly opened wide,
his gaze subconsciously falling below the right ear of the baron.
He then looked at the unremarkable mole near the ear.
The position of the mole was exactly the same as Mr. Azik’s mole!
Chapter 136: The Stumped Klein
This can’t be right… How could Mr. Azik be the ﬁrst in the so-called line
of barons, Baron Lamud? This is a ﬁgure who lived fourteen or ﬁfteen
hundred years ago! No way, how can I be sure that the person in the
portrait is the ﬁrst Baron Lamud? Klein looked at the oil painting, his
mind buzzing in confusion. It was like everyone around him had
become monsters or a dream where the entire world was ﬁlled with
gods.
He looked up and stared at the blond middle-aged man. He extended
his hand to grab his revolver from his armpit holster and said in a
deep voice, “This is not an antique. If you don’t clarify the situation, I
will arrest you and charge you with fraud!”
He didn’t care if prosecution fell under the police department. His
only goal was to threaten the man to get information!
At the same time, Klein clicked his left molars twice to activate his
Spirit Vision. Then, he looked at his target’s emotional color changes.
The blond man jumped in fright and said in a panicked, muﬄed
voice, “No, I’m not sure if it’s an antique either. No, I heard that it’s
an antique, but I don’t know much about such things. I really have no
idea. I don’t even know many words, yea—words.”
He eyes darted around anxiously, seemingly about to cry for help.
Just then, he saw Klein adjust his revolver’s cylinder and hammer. He
looked as though he was going to shoot a suspect that resisted.
He suddenly stood straight and stopped looking around.
“Where did you get the oil painting?” Klein asked heavily.
The blond man’s lips quivered as he said with a fawning smile,
“Oﬃcer, this is what my grandfather found in the ancient castle,
more than forty years ago. An outer wall and the room on the second
ﬂoor collapsed, revealing these items, items that people couldn’t ﬁnd
in the past. One of them was the oil painting. No, no, no, not this oil
painting. The original oil painting was torn and couldn’t be
preserved. So, my grandfather found someone to make a copy of the
painting. Mm, the one you saw just now, I didn’t lie to you. An oil
painting from forty years ago could really be considered as an
antique…”
“Are you sure that this is the portrait of the ﬁrst Baron Lamud?”
Klein stroked the trigger and made sure the man’s gaze didn’t move
an inch.
The blond man chuckled and said, “I’m not sure, but I’m guessing
so.”
“Reason?” Klein nearly laughed at the man’s shamelessness.
“Because there wasn’t any labels on the oil painting,” the blond man
replied seriously for once. “Just like I’m called the Scoundrel Gray,
my father is called the Curly-Haired Gray, and only my grandfather
was the real Gray.”
Klein exhaled silently and asked, “Where’s your grandfather?”
“In the cemetery, he’s been buried there for almost two decades. Next
to him is my father who was buried three years back,” the blond man
answered honestly.
After Klein asked a few questions from diﬀerent angles, he adjusted
the cylinder in front of the blond man and put it back into his armpit
holster.
He put away his police identiﬁcation and turned around in his black
windbreaker before walking towards the motel with his hands stuﬀed
into his pockets. He walked quietly along the street underneath the
dim light that was shining out from the houses that lined both sides
of the street.
I can’t conﬁrm if the portrait is that of the ﬁrst Baron Lamud… I wonder
if the town has the exact historical records of the ancient castle…
Regardless, the man in the portrait must be a person from the past, at least
a thousand years ago…
Besides the hair, he looks almost identical to Mr. Azik. Is this what we call
reincarnation?
Back when Mr. Azik gave up his position in other universities in Backlund
and came to Tingen, perhaps it was driven by instinct…
Hmm, there’s another possibility. Such as, the man in the portrait is Mr.
Azik and Mr. Azik is him!
Having thought of this, Klein felt a jolt. He nearly stumbled on the
steps ahead.
He paced back and forth around a damaged gas street lamp and tried
to incorporate his knowledge from the world of information overload.
According to his earlier guesses, he made a further inference.
Mr. Azik might have become immortal due to some reasons, such as being
a vampire. Could that be why he’s survived for so long?
That’s not right. When has there ever been a bronze-skinned vampire…
Plus, when I shook hands with Mr. Azik, I could clearly feel his body
temperature and the fresh blood that ﬂows within him.
Although he dislikes the heat of the South, he isn’t afraid of the sun. He
once competed in a rowing competition with other teachers under the hot
sun…
Hmm, there’s another possibility. Mr. Azik’s Sequence potion or some
other factors bestowed him with a long life, and the price for it is memory
loss! Man, taking into consideration his various dreams, can I presume
that he loses his memory as part of a cycle? Every few decades, he forgets
his past and gains new life. Then, his dreams are the lives that he has lived
before… Heh heh, I think I’ve read something like that before in a novel…
I can’t just rely on divination to verify this. I have to look for the traces of
the lives that Mr. Azik lived, traces of him not having a childhood, but
starting directly as an adult!
Klein started leaning towards his latter guess. However, he
temporarily couldn’t eliminate the possibility of reincarnation.
He reined in his chaotic thoughts and considered carefully whether
he should inform Captain Dunn about it.
If Mr. Azik was a Beyonder that lived for a thousand years, his ability
would be much stronger than I imagined…
He advised me out of kindness. However, it would be hard to say if he will
remain kind when I ﬁnd clues about his past.
But Mr. Azik has been nice to me all this time. To involve the Nighthawks
would result in a non-trivial possibility of harming him…
Sigh. It looks like I must divine this matter in the world above the gray
fog. This is the most proper choice for a Seer!
Klein made the decision and returned to the hotel quickly.
Since Dunn and Frye had yet to return, he seized the opportunity to
get another room at the cost of one soli.
After he entered the room, Klein made a spirituality wall with the
assistance of Holy Night Powder. Then, he took four steps
counterclockwise, went through the mad ravings, and arrived above
the gray fog.
The lofty palace stood tall and silent while the ancient, mottled
bronze table and twenty-two high chairs remained the same.
Klein took the seat of honor and made a brown goatskin and black
fountain pen appear before him.
He picked up the pen and wrote seriously: “I should tell Dunn Smith
about Mr. Azik.”
Then, he took the topaz pendant from his left sleeve and did a spirit
pendulum divination.
The spirit pendulum divination resulted in the pendulum spinning
counterclockwise, which meant that he shouldn’t tell him!
Putting down the topaz pendant, Klein thought about it and decided
to make an attempt with dream divination, just to be sure.
Thus, he changed his divination statement to: “The result of hiding
matters related to Mr. Azik from the Nighthawks.”
Klein held the goatskin, recited the statement seven times silently,
and leaned backwards to enter a deep sleep.
He saw himself in the illusory, blurry, and distant world. He saw that
he was struggling while drowning in a sea of blood.
Then, there was a hand that extended and pulled him up from the
blood sea. The owner of the hand was Azik with bronze skin and a
small mole near his ear.
The image shattered and reorganized. Klein saw that he was in a dark
and gloomy emperor’s ﬁnal resting place. The surrounding coﬃns
opened one after another.
Azik stood next to him, looking forward, as though he was looking
for something.
Just then, Klein exited the dream in an instant and saw the illusory,
gray, and boundless fog.
The symbolic meaning of the earlier dream is that, if I were to hide the
related matters about Mr. Azik, I would receive his assistance when I’m in
danger in the future. Heh, the danger might have come about because I
helped to keep the secret… What does the last scene mean? I will discover
some mausoleum with Mr. Azik? Yes, perhaps the mausoleum has other
symbolic meanings… Klein clasped his hands together and supported
his chin while he interpreted the contents of the dream divination.
Combining it with the earlier result of the pendulum divination, he
decided to not report his inference to the Captain, but merely bring
up that a townsfolk had taken out a portrait of the ﬁrst Baron Lamud,
and that the portrait looked like a history teacher in Khoy University.
Klein couldn’t be sure that Dunn wouldn’t hear about it elsewhere, so
he had to at least mention it.
Of course, Dunn was unfamiliar with Azik and didn’t know of his
recount and strange dreams, so he would ﬁnd it diﬃcult to connect
them. Klein even suspected that the Captain wouldn’t quite remember
what Azik looked like.
Then, he stopped thinking further and planned to leave the world
above the gray fog. Just then, he noticed the crimson star that had
been silent all this time was twinkling with faint light again.
Klein extended his spirituality with interest and saw the young man
that spoke Jotun again. He saw him kneeling before a pure crystal
ball.
The young man was still wearing the black tights that were diﬀerent
from the clothing of countries in the Northern Continent. His facial
features were blurry and distorted, but Klein could faintly see his
brownish-yellow hair.
He knelt there and prayed with an unusual pain in his tone.
Klein leaned sideways to hear. He relied on his beginner-level Jotun
and barely understood what the young man was saying.
“O Magniﬁcent Deity, please cast your eyes on this land that you
have forsaken.
“O Magniﬁcent Deity, please allow us, the People of the Dark, be
freed from the curse of our destiny.
“I am willing to dedicate my life to you, using my blood to please
you.”
…
A land that was forsaken… People of the Dark… Magniﬁcent Deity…
Klein murmured the few key words and suddenly thought of a place
that The Hanged Man had mentioned once.
The Forsaken Land of the Gods!
It appeared in Roselle’s diary too! He even sent out a ﬂeet to search for it,
but it was fruitless… Klein squinted his eyes and wondered if he had
guessed correctly.
He tapped on the edge of the long bronze table with his ﬁngers. After
three taps, he came to a decision. He extended his right hand and
touched the illusory crimson star.
The cloud of crimson immediately exploded, and the light ﬂowed in
like water.
Chapter 137: City of Silver
City of Silver, Mortuary.
Derrick stood in front of a ﬂight of stairs as he looked straight ahead
with reddened eyes. In front of him were two coﬃns containing his
parents.
Embedded in a stone plate in front of him was a simple silver sword.
The frequent booming of thunder caused the house to shake and the
sword to sway.
The Berg couple inside the coﬃns weren’t completely dead yet. They
struggled to keep their eyes open while making weak attempts to
heave for air, but in the eyes of some, the luster of their lives could
no longer suppress their irreversible darkening.
“Derrick, do it!” An elder dressed in a long black robe looked at the
youth and said in a deep voice with a staﬀ in his hand. The
expression of the youth was visibly contorted.
“No, no, no!” Derrick, who had brownish-yellow hair, shook his head
repeatedly. He took a step back with every word, and ﬁnally let out a
ear-piercing scream.
Thump!
The elder struck down his staﬀ and said, “Do you wish for the whole
city to be buried along with your parents?”
“You should know that we are the People of the Dark who have been
forsaken by God. We, we can only live in a cursed place like this and
all the dead would become horrifying evil spirits. There’s no way to
reverse it regardless of what we do, other than—other than ending
their lives by the hands of a family member!”
“Why? Why?” Derrick asked in despair, shaking his head. “Why are
the citizens of the City of Silver destined to kill their parents the
moment they are born…”
The elder closed his eyes, as if recalling what he had experienced in
the past. “This is our destiny, this is the curse we must bear, this is
the will of God…”
“Draw your sword, Derrick. This is a show of respect for your
parents.
“After this, when you have calmed down, you can try becoming a
Divine Blood Warrior.”
In the coﬃn, Berg tried to speak, but he could only let out a groan
after his chest heaved several times.
Derrick took several steps forward with great diﬃculty, returning to
the side of the silver sword. He extended his shivering right hand.
His brain registered the cold touch of the metal, causing him to recall
the Blood Ice his father brought back when he went hunting. Blood
Ice the size of a mere palm was enough to keep his home cool for a
few days.
Images ﬂashed past his eyes—his stern father teaching sword
techniques, his friendly father patting away the dust on his back, his
gentle mother mending his clothes, his brave mother stepping in
front of him when they encountered a mutated monster, and ﬁnally,
his family huddling in front of a ﬂickering candle and sharing food…
A faint sound croaked from his throat despite his utmost suppression.
With a low grunt, he exerted force with his right hand and drew the
sword.
Tap! Tap! Tap!
He lowered his head and charged forward, raising the sword and
driving it down with force.
Ah! Blood splattered following a pained scream. The blood splattered
onto Derrick’s face and into his eyes.
His vision became red. He pulled out the sword and pierced it into
the coﬃn by the side.
After the sharp metal pierced through ﬂesh, Derrick released his grip
and wavered as he stood up.
He didn’t look at the condition of the people inside the coﬃn. Derrick
stumbled as he ran out of the Mortuary, as if he was being chased by
evil spirits. His ﬁsts and teeth were clenched tight. The blood on his
face left streaks across his face.
The elder who had taken in everything from the side sighed.
There were stone pillars that lined the main streets of the City of
Silver. Atop the stone pillars were lanterns, and within the lanterns
were unlit candles.
There was no sun in the sky here, no moon, no stars; only an
unchanging darkness and lightning that threatened to tear apart
everything.
The citizens of the City of Silver walked along the dark streets with
the illumination of the lightning. The few hours when the lightning
died down was considered by them as the true night as mentioned in
the legends. That was the time where they had to use candles to light
up the city, drive away the darkness, and make it serve as a warning
for the monsters.
Derrick made his way along the street. He didn’t have anywhere he
wanted to go, but as he walked, he realized that he had reached the
door of his house.
He took out his keys and unlocked the door. He saw the familiar
sights, but he didn’t hear his mother’s concerned voice or his father
reprimanding him for running about. The house was empty and cold.
Derrick clenched his teeth again. He walked quickly to his room and
searched for the crystal ball. His father had told him that this was a
crystal ball used by a long-destroyed city to worship their deity.
He knelt and faced the crystal ball, praying without any hope in
mind. He pleaded bitterly, “O Magniﬁcent Deity, please cast your
eyes on this land that you have forsaken.
“O Magniﬁcent Deity, please allow us, the People of the Dark, be
freed from the curse of our destiny.
“I am willing to dedicate my life to you, using my blood to please
you.”
…
Over and over again, just as he was in complete despair and about to
stand, he saw a dark red glow burst forth from the pure crystal ball.
The glow was like ﬂowing water, instantly swallowing Derrick.
When he regained his senses, he realized that he was standing in a
magniﬁcent palace supported by giant stone pillars. In front of him
was a long ancient table, and on the other side of the table was a
human ﬁgure obscured by a thick fog.
Other than that, there was nothing around him. It was empty and
ethereal. Under him was a boundless fog and incorporeal dark red
specks of light.
Derrick felt a ﬂame of hope ignite in his heart. He stared at the
human ﬁgure at the very top, confused and puzzled.
“You, are you God?”
After asking this, he suddenly remembered a statement he read from
a book in the City of Silver and quickly lowered his head.
That statement was: “You may not look directly at God!”
Klein leaned back as he crossed his hands. He adopted a relaxed
posture and answered using the language of the giants, Jotun, “I am
not God, I am merely The Fool who is interested in the long history
of this world.”
Klein had already activated his Spirit Vision by clicking his left
molars. He noticed that the youth in front of him had diﬀerent colors
covering the surface of his Astral Projection and the depths of his
Ether Body.
This meant that he was not a Beyonder.
The Fool… Derrick ruminated over the term and, after a long silence,
said with diﬃculty,
“I don’t care if you’re God or The Fool, my prayers will not change. I
hope that the people of the City of Silver will be freed from the curse
of their destinies. I hope that the sun and sky described in the books
will appear in our skies. If possible—if possible, I wish that my
parents can be revived.”
Hey, I am not a wishing well… Klein put down his hands and laughed.
“Why should I help you?”
Derrick froze. He thought for some time before saying,
“I will oﬀer my soul to you. I will use my blood to please you.”
“I have no interest in the soul and blood of a mortal.” Klein smiled
and shook his head. He saw the color of the youth’s feelings turn into
the color of despair bit by bit.
Without waiting for the youth to speak, Klein nonchalantly said, “But
I can give you a chance.”
“I am a Fool that likes a fair and equal exchange. You can use what
you can attain to exchange with me, or people like you, to exchange
for things you want. But remember, they must be equal in value…”
“This can make you powerful. Perhaps one day, you can rely on your
own strength to free the City of Silver from its curse and make the
sun appear in your sky once again.”
Based on the youth’s description, Klein was conﬁdent that the City of
Silver was the so-called Forsaken Land of the Gods.
Of course, he couldn’t be certain of this for the time being. After all,
the religious literature claimed that the world existed in a “sunless”
state during the First Epoch, the Chaos Epoch. No one knew if there
were any other strange lands that the countries of the Northern
Continent were unaware of, other than the Forsaken Land of the
Gods.
Derrick listened quietly. He lowered his head in silence and replied
after a while, “I want to become the Sun. I wish to obtain the formula
of the corresponding starting Sequence potion from you.”
Sequence, potion, the Sun… The Sequence pathway that the Church of the
Eternal Blazing Sun possesses… From the looks of it, we exist in the same
world…
The term “Sequence” was born from the revelation of the ﬁrst Blasphemy
Slate, which happened at the end of the Second Epoch, the Dark Epoch…
In other words, if the City of Silver is really the Forsaken Land of the
Gods, this means that it was split apart from the Southern and Northern
Continents at the end of the Second Epoch.
Could this be related to the cataclysm of the Third Epoch? According to
the legends, the Evernight Goddess, Mother Earth, and the God of Combat
descended upon this world and protected humans from the cataclysm
along with the Lord of Storms, Eternal Blazing Sun, and the God of
Knowledge and Wisdom… Klein obtained a fair bit of information from
the youth.
But he had trouble interpreting what the youth was saying, and even
more trouble organizing his words, as he wasn’t ﬂuent in Jotun.
Luckily, ancient Feysac was derived directly from Jotun. Klein could
be described as an expert in that area, and thus, he could master
Jotun relatively quickly, preventing him from making a fool of
himself.
Klein maintained his posture. He replied with a calm tone, “We can
discuss this transaction in the future. Do not go out for the next two
days. Try your best to not be in the same room as anyone else.”
He didn’t know the unit of time used in the City of Silver, much less
the time diﬀerence it had with the Loen Kingdom. All he could do
was generalize it as tomorrow and wait until the Tarot Gathering was
over before he told him that was the time for future meetings…
Klein knew that there was a term for “day” in the Jotun, and thus
deduced that the youth would understand even if the City of Silver
didn’t use it as a measure of time.
“Alright, I’ll follow your instructions,” Derrick replied with his head
lowered. He didn’t have any objections.
Klein heaved a sigh of relief. He tapped his ﬁngers on the side of the
table and said, “Before I send you back, let me ﬁrst complete our
equal exchange. I gave you a chance to be strong, and you have to
give me something equal in return.”
“I have said that I am The Fool who is interested in the long history
of this world. What I ask in return is the history of the City of Silver,
everything that you know.”
Derrick thought for a moment before replying softly, “I will describe
it faithfully.”
“The City of Silver has existed ever since the omnipotent and
omniscient God, the Lord that created everything forsook this land.
No, it existed before that, but it was called the Kingdom of Silver.”
Chapter 138: Giant Pathway
The omnipotent and omniscient God… The Lord that created everything…
Klein leaned back and maintained a profound posture while he
ruminated over the words that the youth from the City of Silver had
said.
He was no stranger to a “Lord that created everything.” The Creator
mentioned in the The Book of Storms, The Revelation of Evernight,
and other urban myths referred to the Creator with similar titles. It
was also the way various secret organizations like the Aurora Order
described the True Creator.
But this was the ﬁrst time Klein was hearing of an “omnipotent and
omniscient God” in this world. Be it the Evernight Goddess, Lord of
Storms, and the God of Steam and Machinery, none of them claimed
to be omniscient or omnipotent.
If the City of Silver was really in the Forsaken Land of the Gods, then the
Forsaken Land of the Gods would truly belong to this world. The
“omnipotent and omniscient God” might be the title of the Creator that
was used by the living in ancient times…Klein looked towards the young
man opposite him in thought. He looked at the emotional colors of
pain and sorrow.
When Derrick felt The Fool’s gaze, he lowered his head involuntarily.
He recalled the legends that his parents had told him. He said slowly
and sadly, “When the sun disappeared from the sky, when the clouds
were ripped and torn apart, when lightning and thunder became our
rulers, and the monsters lurking in the dark suddenly emerged, ones
so terrifying beyond one’s imagination, they destroyed one city after
another in the Kingdom of Silver. Humanity’s Dark Ages had arrived.
“The remaining experts in the City of Silver then relied on their
united power and two magical items before they ﬁnally warded oﬀ
the attack of the Things of the Dark. They gradually eradicated the
monsters within a one day journey of the city, and they established a
city-state that protected the last light of human civilization.”
A standard textbook description… Klein couldn’t help but comment in
his head.
The young man’s description made him feel that the City of Silver
was in a diﬀerent world than the Northern Continent.
Maybe this is the unique characteristic of the Forsaken Land of the Gods?
He thought, without revealing his emotions.
Derrick calmed his breathing and continued, “During the ﬁrst few
decades, plants couldn’t grow. The City of Silver had a severe lack of
food, and we could only hunt dark creatures or mutated animals to
relieve our hunger. The population dropped drastically. Fortunately,
we found Black-Faced Grass. It could survive under such
circumstances, and it became our only reliable and stable food
source.
“It was said to be the ﬁnal intervention that the magniﬁcent God left
for us. It allowed one generation after another to live on in the City
of Silver. It persisted in the Dark Ages for 2582 years.
“The passage of time was recorded by a long line of Chiefs. For the
rest of the people in the City of Silver, we call periods of frequent
lightning ‘day,’ and when the lightning subsides, we call it ‘night.’ It’s
a rather confusing system, and it makes exact dates diﬃcult to
pinpoint.”
Such a magical place… Klein was glad that he hadn’t talked about
“tomorrow,” but instead vaguely mentioned the following two days.
Derrick brieﬂy talked about the few memorable incidents in the City
of Silver’s history and said, “When the population returned to a
certain level, the number of Beyonders increased. The six-member
council started forming elite troops to explore the dark. We have now
explored all of the original territory and nearby cities. We are
advancing towards the darker and more terrifying depths of the dark.
At the border, we found cities with strange architectural style, but
they were destroyed at some point. We suspect that they were
sanctuaries built by other remaining humans. Unfortunately, they still
lost to the Things of the Dark in the end.”
The Things of the Dark that he mentions should be a reference to monsters
that hide in the dark, ones that are beyond imagination. Klein nodded
indiscernibly.
“… The Kingdom of Silver was once ruled by the Giant King. Hence,
the Beyonder chain that we are in control of is the Giant pathway,
also known as the Divine Blood Warrior sequence pathway… When
we killed certain monsters and explored those destroyed cities, we
obtained potion formulas of other Sequences. However, the Sequence
pathways are incomplete,” Derrick said, moving on to explain the
current situation in the City of Silver.
Upon hearing that, Klein’s mind jolted. Although he didn’t change his
posture much, he was obviously paying more attention.
I love knowing more about Sequence potions! The Giant King… The City
of Silver and the Northern Continent share the same history? The Second
Epoch’s history… Hmm, killing a monster causes it to drop a formula? Is
this a game? No, there’s another possibility. Those monsters were once
human, Beyonders… Klein suddenly felt a heavy weight on his
shoulders.
Derrick saw that the Fool didn’t reply. He clenched his teeth,
pondered, and said, “The names of the Giant Sequence pathway are
Sequence 9 the Beyonder Warrior, Sequence 8 Gladiator, Sequence 7
Weapons Master, Sequence 6 Dawn Paladin, Sequence 5 Guardian,
and Sequence 4 Demon Hunter. Only the elders in the six-member
council know the names of the higher Sequences.”
Sequence 4 Demon Hunter… This is the name of a High-Sequence potion
formula? This is the ﬁrst time I’ve heard something like this! Klein felt
delighted at the fact that he ﬁnally learned one of the names of the
higher Sequences. However, he suspected that it was a name from
ancient times, which would be diﬀerent from the current version in
the Northern Continent, just like the Windstorm Priest and the
Seafarer.
Oh, Beyonder Warrior, Gladiator, Weapons Master… Sounds familiar…
Oh right, the Sequence pathway that the Church of the God of Combat has
in control is very similar to this! Sequence 9 Warrior, Sequence 8 Pugilist,
Sequence 7 Weapons Master! Due to the limits of his security
clearance, Klein only knew the titles of the ﬁrst three sequences that
the Church of the God of Combat had in control, but the similarity
between the two pathways was still obvious.
Based on the core meaning, they are basically identical. The complete
Sequence that the Church of the God of Combat mastered is the so-called
Giant Sequence pathway… It is said that there was a God that emerged in
the Third Epoch, which was the Cataclysm Epoch, to inherit the estate of
the Giant King? Or could it be that He Himself was an ancient Giant?
Klein analyzed and judged while he maintained his calm appearance.
Derrick continued to explain.
“After we pulled through the initial hardships, the City of Silver has
been ruled by a six-member council ever since. The elder that enjoys
the highest position in the council is called the Chief. The other ﬁve
are equal in rank… The current six-member council is formed by
three Demon Hunters, two Guardians with the greatest potential, and
a Shepherd.”
The City of Silver has three High-Sequence Beyonders! Demigod-like
experts! These three alone could destroy the Tarot Club a hundred times
over… Klein felt a little afraid. He had yet to attempt recruiting
someone under the nose of a High-Sequence Beyonder.
However, since the young man was just a mere commoner, with him
not even at Sequence 9, it was unlikely that he would gain the
attention of the upper echelons for a long time. Thus, Klein relaxed
again.
Is Shepherd from another Sequence pathway, perhaps from one of the
incomplete pathways? Sounds reminiscent of the style of the Aurora
Order. The member from the Aurora Order that wrote a letter to Mr. Z,
what was his name again? He kept mentioning the “Lord’s lamb”… Klein
maintained his leisurely posture and asked casually, “Shepherd?”
“Yes, this is a Sequence pathway that we found from a city that the
Things of the Dark destroyed. It only reached Sequence 5 Shepherd,
but Elder Norwaya is very strong, very strange, and very scary. It is
said that she once won against an evil spirit at the level of a High-
Sequence Beyonder without getting injured. Therefore, when there
was a vacancy in the six-member council, they made an exception for
her,” Derrick, feeling a little fear.
Klein thought, then smiled as he asked, “What’s the Sequences before
Shepherd? I ﬁnd them familiar. As you know, a sequence’s historical
name and its current name is always diﬀerent.”
“In the City of Silver, the names of potions have never changed,”
Derrick refuted instinctively. He then lowered his head and said,
“Sequence 9 Secrets Suppliant…”
Indeed! Klein was satisﬁed when his guesses were conﬁrmed.
This is the name of Sequence 9 from the Aurora Order!
“Sequence 8 is Whispered, Sequence 7 Shadow Ascetic, Sequence 6
Rose Priest, Sequence 5 Shepherd,” Derrick recounted what he knew.
Whispered, Listener, they are about the same… Heh, I know more than
the information provided by the Tingen Nighthawks. In a good mood,
Klein beckoned for Derrick to continue.
Derrick then roughly described the current situation of the City of
Silver, and ﬁnally, he couldn’t help but say, “I carry the curse of
destiny. Whether a citizen of the City of Silver is a commoner or a
Beyonder, we all turn into evil spirits after we die. The evil spirit of a
Beyonder is just stranger, more terrifying, and far more diﬃcult to
deal with. In the past, there were many occasions when this curse
nearly destroyed the City of Silver. The only way to prevent an evil
spirit from rising is for a person to be killed by someone of their own
bloodline.”
“Such a cruel matter. I hope you can grow strong and ﬁnd a method
for the people in the City of Silver to shake oﬀ the curse.” Klein, The
Fool who was merely an empty shell, could only provide some free
chicken soup for the soul.
“So, I want to be the Sun… When there was a Sun shining over the
land, we had never encountered any curse,” Derrick muttered softly
with great diﬃculty and pain.
Klein nodded slightly and asked, “You will have the chance to.
Remember, that I can pull you in here anytime in the next two days.
Try to avoid being around other people.”
“Alright,” Derrick replied solemnly.
“Before that, I need you to conﬁrm your code name.” Klein smiled
and pointed at the deck of tarot cards that appeared on the table.
Conﬁdent that Derrick had never come into contact with tarot cards,
he gave a brief introduction. “Pick one of the cards as your code
name. Anything besides The Fool, Justice, and The Hanged Man.
Derrick took two steps forward, ﬂipped through the tarot cards, and
said without hesitation, “Sun. I pick The Sun.”
“Remember your choice, it will follow you for the rest of your life,”
Klein replied like a charlatan.
At the same time, he extended his hand and severed the connection
in a restrained manner. Then, he watched as the crimson glow
receded, and the young man opposite him turned incorporeal and
dispersed bit by bit.
Chapter 139: Studying 3-0782
After the crimson light in front of him dissipated, Derrick Berg saw
his room once again. He saw the pure crystal ball in his hands.
Crack!
The crystal ball shattered from the inside. Some of it turned into
pieces of illusory beams of light that ﬂew into the void around him,
while the other crystalline fragments fell noisily to the ground.
Derrick looked on, dumbfounded. He could see the traces of blood on
his face reﬂected in the bronze mirror. He noticed a crimson light
spiraling on the back of his right palm, forming a circle with lines
extending out from the edge.
The strange symbol bore into the back of his palm and vanished.
Derrick fell into a daze in the time it took several ﬂashes of lightning
to illuminate the sky before snapping to his senses.
He looked at the fragments of the crystal ball on the ground, then
looked at the back of his right hand as his gaze turned deeper.
He walked out of his bedroom, returned to the living room, and
opened the door to look up at the sky above the City of Silver.
An arc of lightning streaked across the sky, illuminating the city with
a silver sheen. Right on the heels of that was rumbling thunder. The
world belonged to the dark. Without any speck of light, the heavy
darkness only left people in despair.
Derrick clenched his ﬁsts. There was no joy in his eyes for they were
still ﬁlled with the remnant grief and pain.
But he was no longer lost.
…
Phew, looks like I’ve managed to trick another person into becoming a
member. No, I’ve managed to recruit another member… Klein shook his
head and mocked the present strength of his Tarot Club.
The leader, The Fool, was only a Sequence 9, one who had just fully
digested the Seer potion!
And there were at least three High-Sequence Beyonders at Sequence
4 in the hopeless City of Silver that The Sun spoke of!
“After mentioning the acting method one more time, I can start
telling the Captain the speciﬁcs and hand in my special application.
At the very least, I’ll stop being in charge of support once I become a
Clown.” Klein didn’t stay in the world of fog. He extended his
spirituality, wrapped it around himself, and initiated a descent.
Tearing through the gray fog and passing through the ravings, he
returned to his room before dispelling the wall of spirituality.
Then, Klein picked up the key and headed out of the room. He ﬁrst
went to the two rooms booked by Dunn to take a look in order to
conﬁrm that the Captain and Frye hadn’t returned yet. He then
headed to the ﬁrst level and handed the key back to the boss.
The boss looked at the wall clock to the side and gave a thumbs up.
“Well done!”
Hey, are you mistaken over why I booked an hourly room? Klein wanted
to explain himself, but ﬁnally decided to leave the misunderstanding
as it was.
Feeling wronged, he tried to console himself.
Yes, this way, he won’t mention that I rented another room in front of the
Captain!
After heading out and going through the motions, Klein did a quick
divination and returned to the inn based on the results. He headed
straight to the second ﬂoor to ﬁnd Dunn and Frye discussing their
investigations in one of the rooms, just as he expected.
“We can conﬁrm that the wraith appeared within the last three
months,” Dunn summarized to Klein with a nod as he came through
the door.
Klein immediately echoed, “My investigations also conﬁrmed it…”
He highlighted the main points of his questioning and concluded,
“Heh, there’s a townsfolk named Scoundrel Gray who claimed that he
had the portrait of the ﬁrst Baron Lamud. He said that it was an
antique oil painting more than a thousand years old.”
“Don’t tell me you bought it?” Dunn’s eyes shimmered as he was
taken aback before he asked.
Captain, do you think that I’m so stupid to be fooled that easily? Klein
gave a dry laugh.
“No, I didn’t. Even though I’m a history student, I have attended
some lessons on archeology and have some degree of experience in
this area. I can more or less determine if something is fake. Heh, the
person in the portrait looked a little like my history teacher, Mr.
Azik.”
He casually mentioned the most important piece of information.
And indeed, Dunn didn’t pay too much attention to it. He massaged
his temples and said, “This is a small town near a historical site.
There will always be a myriad of ‘antiques’ here. I just saw a vendor
selling the silver wine glasses of Baron Lamud.”
“Someone tried to sell me the insignia of the Lamud Family, claiming
that it had been dug out of the castle,” Frye added.
Klein subconsciously asked, “Did you guys buy them?”
Frye and Klein looked at each other, and didn’t continue with the
subject.
“The next mission is for you or Frye to take Sealed Artifact 3-0782
out of town to somewhere uninhabited. Otherwise, a good half of the
people in this inn will become idiots blathering praises of the Sun.
Are you going ﬁrst, or Frye?” Dunn looked at Klein with his deep
gray eyes.
“Me.” Klein raised his hand slightly and smiled. “It’s still quite early,
so I can come back and have a nice sleep later. We’re doing two-hour
shifts, right?”
“Yes. Frye, go over with Klein and conﬁrm where you’ll exchange the
Sealed Artifact.” Dunn turned to look at Corpse Collector Frye. He
had already found an opportunity to hand Sealed Artifact 3-0782
over to Frye when they split up to conduct their investigations.
Otherwise, he would have been puriﬁed and started praising the Sun.
Frye hadn’t had enough time to recover, and could only hold the item
for another three hours.
“Alright.” Frye took out the Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem from the
inner pocket of his black windbreaker and handed it over to Klein.
Klein took the item with a fair bit of curiosity and interest. The metal
was warm to the touch, as if hot water was ﬂowing within it.
The warm, gentle glow was like a ripple, spreading outward in waves
and bringing with it a pure smell. At the same time, Klein felt that
the dark golden Sacred Emblem carved with the symbol of the Sun
was cleansing his spirituality, removing the impurities and leaving it
pure.
Of course, all Sealed Artifacts have their dangers. Death might occur if
one isn’t careful enough. It’s even possible to have a fate worse than
death… He muttered to himself as he placed the Sealed Artifact
3-0782 into his inner pocket.
After inspecting his revolver, charms, and cane, he walked out of the
room and left the inn together with Frye. They headed straight for
the outskirts of Lamud Town.
The two circled an area beside a sparse and deserted forest and
conﬁrmed that there was no one within dozens of meters of them.
“Chase away anyone who approaches you,” Frye coldly reminded,
“I’ll come to take your place in two hours.”
“Sounds good,” Klein replied with a smile.
After seeing Frye enter the town, he found a tall boulder he had eyed
previously. He picked up some leaves from the tree beside him and
wiped the surface of the boulder.
He then touched the top of the stone with his ﬁnger and inspected
the stone under the light of the crimson moon.
After conﬁrming that it was clean, Klein put on his black
windbreaker and sat down.
Why stand when you can sit! Klein thought to himself.
After a few minutes of silence, he looked at the dark, quiet, and
rather scary forest. He couldn’t help but stand up, taking out several
metal bottles from his hidden pockets and scattering their contents—
herb powder and essential oils—around the boulder.
Klein recited an incantation in Hermes. With the help of the
materials, he created a barrier of spirituality, sealing the area he was
in.
He did this simple ritual for two reasons. First, he didn’t want to rely
too much on his premonition for danger as a Seer to defend against
corpses and spirits launching a sneak attack against him. The second
reason was to—was to keep the bugs away…
This is a hundred times better than insect repellent! Klein sat back down,
satisﬁed.
After sitting there for a few minutes, Klein took out Sealed Artifact
3-0782 out of curiosity. He began a detailed inspection of the
Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem.
I wonder if I could use divination to ﬁnd out its origins and how it
became special… He took out the pen and paper he always had on
him and wrote a statement: “The origin of the Mutated Sun Sacred
Emblem in my hands.”
As a qualiﬁed and true Seer, Klein had made the preparations needed
to divine anywhere.
After reciting the statement seven times, he closed his eyes and
entered a state of Cogitation, using that as a launchpad to propel him
into his dreams.
All he saw were fragmented pieces of light in his dreams. Other than
that, he didn’t learn anything else.
Yes, the Church must have gotten other Seers to attempt the same thing in
the past. The fact that there is no mention of its origins must mean that
there was no result from the divination, just like what happened just
now… Klein sighed. He then thought, I wonder what would happen if
I eliminate the interferences?
This thought immediately ﬁlled Klein’s head, pushing his curiosity to
a peak.
After more than ten minutes of hesitation, he stood up. He decided
that it was ﬁne since there was no one around, considering how he
was in a secluded area of the forest. He took four steps
counterclockwise inside his wall of spirituality before entering the
world above the fog once again.
Klein sat at the seat of honor of the ancient table in the magniﬁcent
palace. He conjured a few sheets of yellowish-brown goatskin and a
black fountain pen, as well as the Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem.
“It feels rather real…” He rubbed Sealed Artifact 3-0782 in his hands,
ﬁnding the tactile feedback identical to the one he had felt in the
outside world.
It instantiates itself based on what I felt? Klein mumbled to himself
before writing down the statement he had come up with previously:
“The origin of the Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem in my hands.”
After reciting the statement seven times, he held the piece of goatskin
and Sealed Artifact 3-0782 in his hands. He leaned back and entered
his dream.
In the blurry dreamworld, Klein saw a drop of glowing gold liquid. It
was warm and bright.
It was suspended above an altar, before a man dressed in a white
classic robe.
The man only had his back facing Klein. He had lost all signs of life
as he fell slowly towards the sacriﬁcial altar.
At that moment, the Sun Sacred Emblem he was holding had come
into contact with the golden liquid, the latter quickly seeping into the
emblem.
The dream quickly dissipated after Klein saw this, waking him up.
So it was because of the golden liquid that this Sacred Emblem has
been so eﬀective and uncontrollable to this day. Hmm, decades have
passed since the discovery of this emblem, but its cleansing powers
haven’t declined. I wonder what that golden liquid was? Some
advanced Beyonder ingredient? Klein toyed with the Sealed Artifact
3-0782 in his hand and slipped into deep thought.
After deliberating over it for a few minutes, he tried to emulate the
feeling he had in the dream. He wanted to separate the golden liquid
from the Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem he had conjured.
He accomplished it almost immediately as the thought came to him.
Klein looked in shock at the emblem which was no longer warm or
pure. He watched as the drops of golden liquid silently suspended
themselves in the air. He had even more praises for this mysterious
space above the fog.
This is practically a miracle, even if the separation and instantiation here
isn’t real!
“The origins of this drop of golden liquid.” He penned down a new
statement with great excitement.
Chapter 140: Expert At Courting
Death
“The origins of this drop of golden liquid.”
After reciting the divination statement seven times, Klein held onto
the goatskin and the illusory golden liquid before leaning back in his
seat.
He didn’t know if he could divine with the item that was instantiated
based purely on a feeling. All he could do was make bold
assumptions and carefully seek conﬁrmation.
In seconds, Klein’s eyes darkened, turning from brown to black as he
entered a state of Cogitation.
His eyelids drooped down and he “saw” the illusory yet blurry dream.
In the blurry world that looked in shambles, a golden, glaring sun
suddenly appeared!
A low grunt resounded across the void. The pure and clean light
suddenly lit everything up as the gold and burning ﬂames swept
outwards.
Boom!
Klein was instantly expelled from his dreamworld and ﬂipped onto
his side as he shivered. His body seemed to become a huge bonﬁre
which burned with a raging ﬂame.
At that moment, his thoughts were all over the place. No proper idea
could form from the chaos in his mind.
Rumble!
The mysterious space above the gray fog shook violently, and the
lofty palace collapsed inch by inch. The ancient, mottled bronze table
broke into a few pieces.
The terrifying changes only continued for three seconds before the
world above the gray fog returned to tranquility as though nothing
had happened.
The gold ﬂame on Klein gradually extinguished. He rolled around on
his charred skin as he groaned in pain, until he eventually regained
his ability to think.
He supported himself on the armrest of the high chair and stood up
with great diﬃculty. He was terriﬁed and confused about what had
just happened.
He had never imagined that a mere divination would result in such
consequences!
He panted and lifted his head to survey his surroundings. He realized
that the lofty palace and ancient bronze table, which looked like they
had stood unchanged since ancient times, had been damaged. In the
world above the gray fog, which had never experienced any
abnormality, it was simply an unprecedented level of damage.
What happened? Did my divination point towards some unfathomable
existence?Klein calmed down slightly and let his burned ﬂesh shed
while he speculated. If I wasn’t protected by this mysterious space above
the gray fog, there might not even be ashes of me left behind… Could that
drop of gold liquid be the blood of a god? Did I see the Eternal Blazing
Sun, or some powerful angel of His? No, that was the sun, so I think it
was the former… Damn, did I just look directly at a god?
Klein felt more fear as he thought about it. He felt that he had nearly
died.
Those who know nothing fear nothing, but those who don’t court death
won’t die… In the future, I can’t just divine anything and everything. Who
knows what I’ll see!
If that were to happen once more, I don’t know if this mysterious space
could even shelter me from fatal damage… When that happens, I’d
actually die…
Yes, it deﬁnitely won’t do if I continue making experiments with the
golden liquid. The existence from before which was likely Eternal Blazing
Sun. He must have sensed the sudden, hidden and unexpected inﬂuence
from the divination above the gray fog and failed to respond in time… If
He were prepared, this mysterious space might not have been able to
withstand the repercussions…
Having come to this realization, Klein’s body had already returned to
normal. It was no longer charred, but compared to before, he was
dimmer and more incorporeal than before.
He lifted his hand to massage his temples and commanded with his
mind to restore the palace and the long table.
Then, the palace that looked like the home of a giant and the long
table cast out of bronze returned to normal. Everything looked like it
had before.
Klein sat down and leaned against the back of the chair. He mocked
himself and said,
Well, this isn’t entirely bad. At least I know the limit of the mysterious
space and I have a certain goal… Only powers approaching the angels of
the gods can completely inﬂuence the power of the area above the gray
fog?
Sigh, I have to add another new rule to my Seer principle. ‘Do not
randomly divine things that involve a high-level entity.’ Yes, I shouldn’t
hastily activate my Spirit Vision either. If I were to look directly at things
that shouldn’t be looked at directly, it might be game over. In the outside
world, I don’t have the mysterious space to fend oﬀ most of the negative
eﬀects…
After a while, Klein’s expression turned odd because some knowledge
was reverberating in his head.
Yes, knowledge!
In the short time he had spent with what appeared to be Eternal
Blazing Sun, Klein was constantly in his divination state. Hence, he
could instinctively divine certain matters and knowledge from the
being that he was looking at.
He quickly used a dream divination to recall and organize what he
had gathered that wasn’t his primary objective. He picked up the
black fountain pen and wrote one line after another.
“1. Do not look directly at God.
“2. Pure white angel.
“3. The technique of making a Flaring Sun Charm… It’s a relatively
high level charm in the domain of the Sun. Its potency can last a year
before it deteriorates… There’s no need for a ritual to pray to the
Eternal Blazing Sun, but the procedure requires the Sealed Artifact
3-0782 to take the ritual’s place. It will siphon power from the
Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem…
“4. Extremely hostile towards Lord of Storms and God of Knowledge
and Wisdom.
“5. Bard potion formula:
Main ingredients: a Crystal Sunﬂower or an adult Flint Bird’s tail
feather or a Fire Bird’s tail feather… A piece of Siren Rock or a
Singing Sunﬂower…
Supplementary ingredients: a blade of Midsummer Grass, 5 drops of
July Wine Juice, a blade of Elf Dark Leaf…
“6. Light Suppliant potion formula:
Main ingredients: a piece of Brilliance Rock or powder of Dazzling
Soul or… Blood of a Mirror Hedgehog or the Heart of a Magma
Titan…
Supplementary ingredients: a Golden-edged Sunﬂower, three drops of
Aconite Juice…
“7. Priest of Light potion formula:
Information of main ingredients missing.
Supplementary ingredients: 5 grams of Rosemary, 7 drops of ﬁngered
citron juices, Rock Water…
“8. Sequence 4, Unshadowed potion formula. Main ingredients could
be the golden blood of god extracted from the Mutated Sun Sacred
Emblem. It could also be replaced with three adult Sun Divine Bird’s
tail feathers and a piece of Holy Brilliance Rock.
Information of supplementary ingredients missing…”
After writing down the eight lines, Klein couldn’t help but rap the
edge of the long bronze table.
He had gained way more than he imagined!
He was already satisﬁed with surviving his reckless divination earlier,
but now he had received an unexpected “survival reward.”
From the conﬁdential information he received from the Nighthawks,
he knew that the Sequence pathway that the Church of the Eternal
Blazing Sun held was called Sun, and its Sequence 9 was Bard. It
would allow the Beyonder to imbue courage and strength for
themselves and their allies through their singing, a “job” that brought
about devotion and submission. Their slogan was “Let us praise the
Sun!”
The corresponding Sequence 8 was Light Suppliant. They could cast
spells and hold rituals from the Sun’s domain which were very
eﬀective against corpses and spirits. Sequence 7 was called Solar
High Priest, which greatly enhanced the spells and rituals within its
domain.
In other words, I have obtained the complete potion formulas of Sequence
9 and Sequence 8 in the Sun Sequence pathway. Yes, unlike before, the
potion formula even lists replacement items and ingredient names from
diﬀerent eras… As expected of formulas obtained directly from Eternal
Blazing Sun through divination! Klein thought in satisfaction.
He had originally planned on seeing if The Hanged Man could solve
the request of the young man from the City of Silver. After all, the
Church of the Lord of Storms and the Church of the Eternal Blazing
Sun were the most ancient orthodox sects. They had fought against
each other for thousands of years, so it would only make sense for the
two churches to have learned the initial sequence of each other’s
pathways.
The Hanged Man might not have cared about the Sun pathway previously,
but since he is very likely a Sequence 7 Seafarer, it would probably be
easy for him if he really needed to gather the information. However, I
don’t need him now. I solved it myself, through an unbelievable yet
extremely dangerous method… Miss Justice, Mr. Hanged Man, my Sun
friend, your Fool nearly turned himself into a charred corpse… Klein
lampooned silently while still feeling a lingering sense of fear.
He lowered his head and looked at the records on the goatskin before
him. He thought of another formula.
Would the Priest of Light be an ancient name of Solar High Priest? The
conﬁdential information of the Nighthawks never mentioned it, and my
divination didn’t pinpoint the Sequence number… Is it Sequence 6, or
Sequence 5?
Sequence 4, Unshadowed… This is the ﬁrst High-Sequence formula that
I’ve obtained! It’s such a pity that it lacks the supplementary ingredients. I
wonder how I can ﬁll in the blanks? I can’t believe that drop of golden
liquid is really the blood of a god. Sealed Artifact 3-0782 is probably far
stronger than anyone imagines. From what I can see, it’s suﬃcient to
become a Grade 1 Sealed Artifact.
Yes, it’s likely that the Nighthawks from before only determined whether
the item has any traits of the living, how much danger it would cause to
nearby humans, how diﬃcult it is to control the item’s eﬀects, and if it
can be used against corpses and spirits. They had no way of discovering its
unique origin.
The Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem can probably even ﬁght against evil
spirits… How could the examiner ﬁnd an evil spirit to experiment on?
As an oﬃcial Nighthawk, I can’t become the owner of Sealed Artifact
3-0782, but, yes, I can ﬁnd an opportunity to make a Flaring Sun Charm
and siphon its power? Sigh. I certainly can’t do it now. I haven’t prepared
the necessary ingredients. Why would I, a Nighthawk of the Evernight
Goddess, carry the ingredients of the Sun around with me?
Klein massaged his forehead regrettably. He saw that there was no
other movement in the world above the gray fog and ﬁnally relaxed.
He conﬁrmed that the Eternal Blazing Sun hadn’t managed to track
him down.
Do not look directly at God, do not look directly at a high-level entity. I
must remember this!
Why would the Eternal Blazing Sun be extremely hostile towards the Lord
of Storms and the God of Knowledge and Wisdom?
What the hell is a pure white angel?
…
As these mixed thoughts ﬁlled his brain, Klein felt the emptiness and
an aching pain in his head. Plus, he felt that too much time had
passed. He had to return to the outer world, just in case someone
discovered anything amiss.
Back then, he thought it would take a minute or so to divine two or
three times in the mysterious space. Plus, there was a spirituality wall
isolating him from everything else. Once it was touched, his body in
the world above the gray fog would sense it. Hence, he felt utterly
safe, but he hadn’t considered the possibility of having some sort of
accident. In the end, he nearly lost his life and that wasted quite a bit
of time.
Due to the fact that he was afraid that he would be greeted by a Light
of Puriﬁcation beam or discover that the Mutated Sun Sacred
Emblem was damaged, he enveloped his body with spirituality before
he stimulated a descent with his heart in his mouth.
The crimson moonlight reﬂected in his eyes, and there was a
darkness hidden within. Klein saw the sparse forest and the weeds
before him, as well as the intact Sealed Artifact 3-0782 in his hands.
After a few seconds of breathless anxiety, he ﬁnally believed that he
was safe.
Phew… Klein let out a breath of relief. He felt exhausted after his
insane probing at the border of death.
Chapter 141: Nightmare
The exhausted Klein dispelled the sealed wall of spirituality, allowing
the cool wind to blow onto his face. The scent of grass and trees that
the wind carried revitalized him.
He rubbed the warm and classic Sealed Artifact 3-0782 with his
hands and sighed to himself.
“Who would have thought that there would be a drop of god’s blood
in this emblem? I have to assume that the experts from the Church of
the Eternal Blazing Sun must have tried searching for this item in the
past, but couldn’t ﬁnd it…”
Klein stretched his neck. He didn’t dare try anything else, keeping the
Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem in the inner pocket of his windbreaker.
His hand followed a chain and took out a silver vine-leaf pocket
watch. He opened it to see that there was still about an hour before
Corpse Collector Frye’s shift.
I need two matches to prop up my eyelids… This is a side eﬀect of that
near-death experience! Klein didn’t have any other ideas. All he could
do was take out a small metal bottle from a tiny hidden pocket. He
uncapped the bottle and brought it near his nose.
A pungent smell, a mix of mint and disinfectant, quickly entered his
nose, giving Klein goosebumps. His senses were jolted, making him
forget his fatigue temporarily.
He had learned the formula from Corpse Collector Frye. It was called
Quelaag’s Oil, and it could help a person ignore the stench of rotting
corpses, as well as refresh and clear the mind.
The next hour felt like torture. Klein paced around from time to time,
and was bitten by the mosquitoes in the forest several times.
Finally, he saw the black-haired, blue-eyed Frye walking out of the
town wearing a windbreaker and holding a cane.
Even though Frye still looked like a living corpse, Klein felt as though
he was looking at his savior. He covered his mouth and let out a
yawn, making his eyes teary. He made his way over and took out
Sealed Artifact 3-0782 from his pocket.
“What happened?” Frye asked as he looked at his partner’s pale face.
Klein sighed and said, “I just did my shift at Chanis Gate the previous
night and didn’t sleep too well in the morning, so I’m very tired.”
He didn’t elaborate further and changed the subject. “Shall I come for
my next shift four hours from now?”
“Seven hours. The Captain doesn’t need sleep at night.” Frye took the
Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem.
I’m glad someone enjoys staying up late… Klein ridiculed the Captain
under his breath. He bade goodbye to Frye and walked towards the
town.
On the way back to the inn, he took out his pocket watch again and
checked the time.
Hmm, ten minutes earlier than we arranged… What a nice person…
Klein laughed and walked faster. He returned to the inn and opened
the half-closed door. The boss watched him as he made his way to
the second ﬂoor before he entered his room.
He removed his coat and shoes after locking the door. He didn’t wash
up, but instead fell directly onto the bed.
His breathing became heavy in just a few seconds, then long and
peaceful.
In his dreams, Klein returned to Earth where he was playing a game
he hadn’t beaten. A cup of soda and a plate of spicy chicken wings
were on his left. To his right was a bowl of rice and bitter bamboo
shoots meat soup.
He didn’t like bitter bamboo shoots, but he liked it in soup with meat
slices. The refreshing taste and the little bit of fat from the meat were
tantalizing, a perfect complement to the rice.
He could eat an extra bowl of rice if it was paired with some good
sauce dip!
Just as Klein was about to enjoy his supper and continue playing his
game, his dream changed again, presenting him with the internal
layout of 2 Daﬀodil Street.
Klein suddenly became alert, aware that he was dreaming.
He saw himself seated at the side of the dining table, a copy of the
Tingen Daily Tribune in his hand. In front of him was a bowl of
tomato oxtail stew, pan-fried lamb chops, mashed potatoes, and
wheat bread.
He subconsciously turned to look at the door, suddenly noticing a
ﬁgure standing outside the window of the living room, silently
staring inside the house!
Klein was shocked. He immediately recognized the gray-eyed Dunn.
Half his face was clinging close to the window as he silently watched
the people inside.
… Captain, can you not scare someone in their dreams? Is this your way
of acting as an Nightmare? Klein thought, ﬁnding humor in his
exasperation. He scooped up a mouthful of stew and put it into his
mouth.
Ah, this is my cooking! He sighed to himself. He understood why he
became suddenly became alert in his dream, why the scene of him on
Earth vanished.
He would naturally become aware when someone barged into his
dreams!
At this moment, Dunn left his spot by the oriel window and directly
entered the house. In his black windbreaker, he came silently before
Klein.
He took oﬀ his hat and nodded before sitting down. He didn’t stand
on ceremony, picking up cutlery and quickly polishing oﬀ the stew,
lamb chops, wheat bread on the table.
Klein looked on dumbfounded, unsure what the Captain was doing.
Phew. Dunn exhaled in satisfaction and gave Klein a thumbs up. He
then took out his pipe and a matchstick before taking an intoxicated
puﬀ.
He exhaled a cloud of smoke and stood up. He then put on his hat
and bowed before leaving the house and the dream.
“…” Klein looked at the Captain’s back, unable to collect himself for
a long time.
He looked down at the empty plates and instinctively wanted to
conjure up the food he had just now.
But this time, the oxtail stew, lamb chops, mashed potatoes didn’t
appear in his dream.
It was completely eaten? A Nightmare can do that? Klein twitched his
lips and thought in frustration. So the Captain’s goal was to prevent me
from eating supper in my dream? That sure is a nightmare… This method
of acting as a Nightmare sure is creative…
He let out a laugh and exited his dream, once again falling asleep.
At about half past ﬁve the morning the next day, Klein, who had no
choice but to wake up early, drink his coﬀee and eat his toast and
bacon. He hurried out of town to take over from Dunn.
At seven in the morning, they prepared to set oﬀ back to Tingen.
It wasn’t even ten when they arrived at 36 Zouteland Street. Fyre sat
behind the typewriter after Dunn, the most energized of the lot,
returned Sealed Artifact 3-0782 to the back of Chanis Gate. He took
advantage of the fact that the clerks hadn’t arrived yet so that he
could write a report on the mission and the claims of the related
expenditures.
Klein looked on from the side, satisﬁed that the items he had
expended were within the list—including the materials he used to
drive the bugs and mosquitoes away.
He didn’t return home immediately, for he had arranged to meet the
asylum’s Doctor Daxter at one in the afternoon at the agreed upon
venue through a coded letter.
Then there’s still the Tarot Gathering at three… Why does the boss of a
secret society have such a tiring life? Klein thought to himself. He took
a two-hour nap in the Nighthawks break room to catch up on sleep.
He didn’t forget the information he had obtained the previous day.
He wasn’t worried that he would forget, for the information could be
recalled using divination. He was afraid that he would disregard the
existence of this information and even lose the ability to divine the
information. Thus, he recalled the pieces of information once again
before he slept to reinforce them.
This was also the reason Klein insisted on doing a review every week
and reorganize all the information he knew.
After lunch, he took a look at his pocket watch and left the
Blackthorn Security Company for the Shooting Club at 3 Zouteland
Street.
Klein entered the reception area after pushing open the door, but he
didn’t head directly to the shooting range belonging to the
Nighthawks. Instead, he found a seat in the hall as he waited
patiently with his black cane in hand.
He had arranged to meet Daxter at the Zouteland Street Shooting
Club!
He had arranged this through handwritten letters. Whenever Klein
needed to meet him, he would write to Doctor Daxter Guderian in
place of a patient’s family member and ask about a unique condition
called “dissociative identity disorder.” In his letter, Klein would use
various methods to mention the term Spectator, as well as a hidden
mark of ink to authenticate his identity. The letter would also
casually mention a time to meet.
As for the place to meet, they had already decided this the ﬁrst time
they met. If Klein felt that there was a need to change the location,
he would mention it when they met in person.
When Daxter Guderian needed to meet for nonurgent matters, he
could send a letter to the Hound Pub or the Shooting Club. The
recipient would be marked as Mr. Hornacis which Klein would take
at scheduled times.
In urgent situations, he could hand the letter directly to the boss of
the Hound Pub, Wright, and mention his “search for mercenaries.”
This way, Wright, who was an associate of the Nighthawks, would
immediately hand the letter over to the Blackthorn Security
Company.
After waiting for a while, Klein saw the reﬁned Daxter enter the
Shooting Club, a few minutes past one.
He was wearing a black hat and a ﬁtted tuxedo. He had a cane inlaid
with silver in his hands, as well as a pair of gold-framed spectacles on
his face.
Daxter walked around the club without attracting attention and saw
Klein, who nodded slightly. He then retracted his gaze and walked to
the counter, expertly applying for a shooting range and renting a gun.
This was not his ﬁrst visit.
“Small shooting range 7, 3 soli an hour. The fee for renting a revolver
is one soli seven pence per hour and it contains six rounds,” the
receptionist quickly settled the request.
After Daxter conﬁrmed that he was renting the items for an hour and
paid the fee of 10 soli, he took the revolver and extra bullets and was
led into the respective shooting range by the facilitator.
Klein waited another ﬁve minutes before slowly standing up. He
grabbed his cane before walking to the small shooting range 7 and
knocked on the door.
The door opened a tiny crack with a creak. Daxter ﬁrst looked around
cautiously, then opened the door fully.
Klein immediately entered and locked the door.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Daxter,” he said as he took out a 10 soli bill. He
handed the bill over to Daxter. “We wouldn’t let our associates bear
any extra fees.”
Because I can claim compensation… He added in his heart.
Daxter didn’t decline. He took the cash and asked heavily, “Mr.
Moretti, why did you ask to meet me?”
Chapter 142: Association
Klein obviously couldn’t just bring up the Telepathist formula right at
the start. However, he didn’t hide his intention either. After all, the
man opposite him was a Spectator. He wouldn’t be conned so easily.
“Has Hood Eugen behaved unusually recently?” he ﬁrst asked Daxter
Guderian about the patient in the asylum who was a member of the
Psychology Alchemists.
Daxter examined Klein’s eyes, expression, and gestures. He thought
and said, “No, he’s acting normal. Frankly speaking, I think if he
really wanted to leave the asylum, he could immediately behave in a
very healthy and very normal manner. But he hasn’t done so, and he
continues to stay in the asylum. He appears to be treating every
patient. Yes, patients who exhibit chaotic, violent, or abnormal
thoughts appear to be getting better. Maybe Hood Eugen is trying to
train his Beyonder powers with this method.”
Psychiatrist, Sequence 7 that corresponds to Spectator? Perhaps even
higher… Since Hood Eugen isn’t a doctor in the asylum but entered as a
patient, it means that he hasn’t truly grasped the acting method. It should
be as Daxter has guessed; he’s probably training his Beyonder skills and
doing so resembles that of the “acting method.” To a certain extent, it
could slow down the potion’s negative inﬂuence. Hence, Hood Eugen
decided to just take the asylum as his home… Klein openly showed that
he was in deep thought regarding Hood Eugen’s matter.
Because that would make Daxter Guderian feel that he knew and
understood a lot, making him appear unfathomable.
With this in mind, Klein guessed something else. The Psychology
Alchemists hadn’t grasped the “acting method.” After all, even a mainstay
member at the Sequence 7 was unaware of this. In this era with few
Beyonders, a Sequence 7 was considered mid level in any secret
organization. They were important enough to know crucial matters,
especially those that could help members resist the loss of control.
Plus, the Psychology Alchemists was a secret organization that had only
been established in the last three hundred years or even earlier. It was
understandable that they hadn’t grasped or deduced the “acting method.”
The only organization that brought up the method explicitly was the Secret
Order. They were an ancient organization that had more than ﬁfteen
hundred years of history and could be traced back to the previous epoch!
Hey, the Church of the Goddess is even older than the Secret Order. Just
the Letter of Saints from the The Revelation of Evernight clearly indicates
that it’s nearly three thousand years old. That’s not to mention the
mythical legends before that… How could such an ancient church not
discover the “acting method?”
During the long history of a huge organization, there must have been
members who experimented with various possibilities, just like Spirit
Medium Daly. They might not have understood the principle of the acting
method in detail, but they acted out the name of the potion correctly
anyway. They would have discovered the gist of it through the good
feedback they received. As that accumulates through the generations of
Nighthawks, unless the higher-ups were a bunch of curly-haired baboons,
it would be impossible to deduce the “acting method!”
Klein’s thoughts made the connection and was suddenly shocked.
To the Nighthawks who didn’t know of the “acting method,” someone like
Spirit Medium Daly was a genius, an example that an ordinary member
couldn’t emulate. Hence, no one suspected that the experience of Daly and
others could be adapted for their own use.
But to those who have grasped the “acting method,” this would be
extremely odd!
Klein believed that in the long history of the Church of the Evernight
Goddess, Spirit Medium Daly was deﬁnitely not the ﬁrst member to
have used the “acting method ” to digest the Low Sequence potions
quickly. She might not even be in the top ten or top ﬁfty!
It doesn’t make sense. Unless Daly didn’t understand the “acting method”
on her own, but had other people’s guidance… Then, it could be
concluded that every member of the Holy Cathedral follows the beliefs of
the past, believing in their predecessor’s experience, and not daring to
rebel against their teaching. After all, rebelling would imply the loss of
control most of the time… Yes, other than this explanation, there is
another possibility. The higher-ups of the church have hidden the “acting
method” for some reason…
I need to ﬂip through some records and search for examples of Beyonders
in the Church of the Evernight Goddess digesting their potions quickly, as
well as their ﬁnal outcome… Klein thought with a mask of solemnity.
Daxter looked at him, waited for a few minutes, and asked curiously,
“Oﬃcer, is there some sort of problem with Hood Eugen’s actions?”
“Not right now. It just made me think of other matters,” Klein
replied, smiling. He cast his suspicions aside.
He asked instead, “Has there been any actions taken by the
Psychology Alchemists recently?”
“No, besides a small gathering in Awwa to exchange items and
experience,” Daxter answered honestly.
Klein nodded slightly and said, “How about your own situation?”
Daxter controlled his expression as he replied, “Not too good myself.
I still hear some ravings and have some illusions. If I wasn’t a doctor
specializing in mental health, I might even think that I have some
sort of disorder.”
As he spoke, his face grew solemn. “I followed Hood Eugen’s and
your instructions to ignore those illusions and ravings. That made me
feel much better, but they still aﬀect my sleep, and I have become
more grumpy and short-tempered. I’m not like myself, as though
another new me is growing from within, or maybe it could be
described as a new character. I’m very worried and terriﬁed that I
might suddenly lose control one day.”
Just as I have predicted, I didn’t even need to divine to see that coming…
Having prepared for this, Klein smiled and said, “You don’t have to
worry, you’re a subsidiary member of the Nighthawks now. There are
beneﬁts for you. As an ancient organization, we master many
methods to keep one from losing control. It isn’t one hundred percent
eﬀective, but it will deﬁnitely help you.”
“Besides, I’m willing to share with you my personal experience. You
must know the man standing before you only used a month to shake
oﬀ the shackles of illusions and ravings, and they haven’t resurfaced.
You should know from Hood Eugen and your other cadres that doing
so is very diﬃcult.”
For Sequence 8 Telepathist, Klein bragged a little.
“Oﬃcer, there’s a bit of a lie in what you said, but it’s mostly the
truth,” Daxter suddenly said calmly. “What do you want from me?”
It’s tough to lie to a Spectator… Klein replied with a smile, “It’s not
something that only I want to get.”
Miss Justice wants it too.
Of course, he knew that Daxter would deﬁnitely assume that the
Nighthawks Squad wanted something.
“If your method is really eﬀective, and the items or information you
want is within my reach…” Daxter weighed his words as he spoke.
“I will give you the perks in advance,” Klein said straightforwardly.
“We want the Telepathist formula.”
He wouldn’t hide the potion formula but inform the Captain as well.
He would tell the Captain that Daxter used it in exchange for his
personal experience on bringing the potion under control.
During the procedure, Klein would deﬁnitely verify the formula and
“accidentally” memorize it in his head.
Besides, he would use the fact that he used his personal experience in
exchange for the formula to earn merit with the Nighthawks.
By then, with his previous merits, he might not even need to put in
extra eﬀort to apply for the Clown formula and main ingredients.
A formula for two deals, quite a good bargain… Klein thought happily.
Daxter looked into his eyes and kept quiet for a while before he said,
“You’re very frank… I’ll try my best to get the formula, but I’m not
sure how long it’ll take me. If it gets too dangerous, I hope that I can
replace it with something else.”
“No problem.” Klein didn’t intend to force the request on the man. He
then described the ” acting method ” vaguely. “The key to resisting
the loss of control lies within the name of the potion. We have to
understand it and learn its true meaning. You can’t completely
understand it by thinking about it. It must be understood through
experience. For instance, as a Spectator, you have to understand that
you’re only a spectator, not an actor. How a Spectator should act is
something that you need to discover through attempts and
experimentation to deduce the principles required of you. From
there, adhere to it strictly.”
Daxter listened attentively. Then, he replied, “That’s a brand new
way to look at things. Heh, I’m willing to use the word ‘theory’ to
describe what you just said. This is just like a theory of a play and
opera… I’ll try, and I hope it’ll help.
“If—if it really works, I’ll do my best to get you the Telepathist
formula!”
“May the Goddess protect you.” Klein drew a crimson moon on his
chest.
Klein didn’t request the potion formula of Psychiatrist as well,
because he knew that it was a task that Daxter couldn’t complete
with his current position. He might end up exposing him if he wasn’t
careful.
Thus, he planned to take it one step at a time by helping Daxter
achieve a higher position in the Psychology Alchemists slowly.
Then, the long-term beneﬁts would be abundant.
Klein looked outside through the peephole in the door, then he left
quickly and turned to the small shooting range that was designated
for the Nighthawks.
He entered and locked the door. His face grew grave once again.
When he was guessing the reason why the Church of the Goddess
hadn’t developed the “acting method, ” he realized another thing that
he had overlooked!
He had overlooked it because he had obtained two crucial factors in
reverse order. It made him fail to make a further consideration.
The ﬁrst matter was that the Antigonus family was destroyed by the
Church of the Evernight Goddess.
The second matter was that the Antigonus family had the Seer
Sequence in its grasp, or at least, most of it.
As there was a very long period of time between when Klein learned
the two facts, he almost didn’t piece them together. Hence, he
overlooked something that should have been pretty obvious.
Since the Antigonus family had grasped a majority of the Sequences of the
Seer pathway, how is it possible that the Church of the Evernight Goddess
only received Sequence 9 Seer?
They should have obtained more than that as the spoils of war!
If a member from the Aurora Order got ahold of the Clown formula from
the Antigonus family’s magical notebook, then what about the Church that
destroyed the entire Antigonus family?
Even if the Antigonus family was well prepared and hid their most
valuable things at the highest peak of Hornacis Mountain, the Church of
the Evernight Goddess shouldn’t have gained so little. They were the ones
who killed the family members of Antigonus family. Furthermore, the dead
can be made to speak!
Chapter 143: The Fool's Real-
time Translator
Klein paced around the small shooting range as he pondered over the
intent of the Church of the Evernight Goddess regarding the Seer
pathway.
Do they not want Nighthawks to choose this pathway, or do they not want
Beyonders to become powerful through this pathway? As such, they only
revealed the Sequence 9 Seer which is clearly a support type? Captain also
mentioned that the Holy Cathedral might have the subsequent recipes…
No, they didn’t even provide the names of the potions for Sequence
Numbers 8 and 7 in the conﬁdential information that I read. They merely
described the battle characteristics of each Sequence… In other words,
they don’t want those under them to realize that the Church might hold
the actual formulas.
Is there a possibility that Nighthawks who chose this pathway could
become “vengeful spirits” for the Antigonus family, and thus, the higher-
ups of the Church made a decision like this? Or could there be some other
reason?
Klein suddenly felt incredibly suspicious, a sense of intense wariness
and vigilance, towards the higher-ups of the Church. He began
reconsidering whether he should openly hand over the special
application to become a Clown.
If there are some terrifying secrets behind this, wouldn’t I be jumping into
the ﬁre myself? Frankly, I’m not a person that can be placed under strict
investigation…
But the Tingen branch has handed the Clown potion formula over to the
Church. Any Seer who learned of this would hope to advance. Isn’t that
normal? Sequence 8 is still considered a low Sequence, so it shouldn’t
invite too much attention…
The only problem is that I would only take a month to completely digest
the potion and submit a special application. If the higher-ups are familiar
with the “acting method,” they would be able to realize what I did
immediately… Of course, I do have an excuse; I know Spirit Medium Daly
after all. Old Neil, who is strict in abiding by the Mystery Pryer’s maxim,
is also my friend. The claim that I gained inspiration from them and
reﬁned the “acting method” isn’t too hard to believe.
Yes, even Daly received attention from the higher-ups only after showing
signs of digesting a Sequence 7 potion in three years, and is now being
nurtured to become a future Archbishop. Being at the stage of Clown
shouldn’t garner me too much attention—unless I fully digest the Clown
potion in a few months, giving them conﬁrmation to believe that I have
truly mastered the “acting method”…
In other words, applying for the Clown potion isn’t a risky move. I can
continue with that plan, but I should pay attention to this in the future.
Sigh, I’ll have to take things one step at a time. I’ll do a divination back at
home.
Klein collected himself and took out his revolver from his holster
before carrying on with his daily shooting practice and maintenance.
The quality of the revolver that he had gotten from his schoolmate,
Welch, was unexpectedly good. Without any surprise, it would last
for quite some time. Of course, he had to credit Dunn and Leonard
for teaching him how to maintain a revolver.
To be honest, it doesn’t matter if it’s damaged. These are all things I can
request compensation for. Klein looked at the target, put away his
revolver, and left the Shooting Club.
He took the public transport back to 2 Daﬀodil Street. Before arriving
at his destination, he saw a young lady pacing about his door.
This lady was dressed in a blue lacy dress, as well as a thinly veiled
hat. She was Melissa’s classmate—Elizabeth who had her adorable
baby fat.
She quickly approached when she saw Klein arrive, taking oﬀ her hat
to reveal her joyful face.
She paused for two seconds before smiling.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Moretti. I’m guessing that you just came back
from Lamud Town, right?”
I’m sorry, I came back in the morning… Klein smiled.
“No, I came from Zouteland Street.”
Yes, that was a very honest answer… He laughed to himself.
Elizabeth froze for a moment, then said with excitement, “Alright, I
guessed wrongly. I came to look for you because I wanted to tell you
that I didn’t have that nightmare last night. I no longer dreamed
about the knight in black armor! This was exactly the same as the
result of your divination!”
Of course — that wraith was completely puriﬁed by Sealed Artifact
3-0782. I couldn’t channel his spirit even if I was there, much less your
dream… Klein laughed and replied gently, “I’m happy that you’re
freed from your troubles. I’m also very satisﬁed with my divination
yesterday.”
“Thank you, thank you once again! Alright, I have to go now, I still
have lessons in the afternoon. Bye bye, Mr. Moretti. I’ll visit Melissa
when I have the time~” Elizabeth left joyfully, renting a carriage by
the side of the road.
As the carriage began to roll forward, she smiled and thought
proudly, Melissa deﬁnitely doesn’t know how great her brother is…
…
It seems as though my explanation just now was useless. Young ladies
would rather trust their intuition and the truths made up in their minds…
Klein saw Elizabeth board the carriage and opened the door to his
house. He made his way to his room.
He rested for a while before he began to consolidate everything that
had happened over the past week, including the questions he had yet
to resolve.
After completing the task, he burned his notes, took out his pocket
watch, and opened it.
“Half past two? There’s another ﬁfteen minutes left…” Seeing that he
still had time, Klein put on his oldest suit and headed to Smyrin
Bakery at Iron Cross Street to buy a cup of sweet iced tea from Mrs.
Wendy.
He drank his beverage as he returned, then sealed his room with a
wall of spirituality at ﬁfteen minutes to three. He then took four steps
counterclockwise and entered the world above the gray fog.
In the quiet, ancient palace, Klein conjured a piece of goatskin and
wrote down a divination statement: “I should obtain the Clown
potion through the Nighthawks.”
He put his pen down and untangled the spirit pendulum on his wrist.
He grabbed the pendulum ﬁrmly with his left hand, allowing the
topaz to be suspended right above the piece of paper.
He recited the statement seven times. His eyes darkened and the
pendulum in his hand started to turn. It turned clockwise.
It’s a positive answer, so it’s appropriate. But it’ll be hard to say for the
sequences after Clown. I should seriously develop my Tarot Club… Klein
did another divination to conﬁrm the answer.
After this, he used his hand and pressed down on the dark red star
representing the Sun.
He wanted to bring the youth from the City of Silver in early and ask
if he revealed whatever had happened in this world to the six-
member council. If he hadn’t, then Klein would give him a better way
of knowing what time the gatherings would start.
…
In a room of the Berg household in the City of Silver.
Derrick sat silently by the side of his bed, waiting for The Fool’s
summoning.
In order to avoid being near anybody, he didn’t even go out of the
house after he “returned.” He had nearly ﬁnished all the food in his
room.
Bearing with the hunger and hearing the growls of his stomach,
Derrick felt as though he was a living corpse roaming around on a
dark plain. However, he remained silent nor did he stand.
At that moment, he saw a dark red color spread in the air, quickly
swallowing him.
The gray, boundless, cold, lonely world appeared in his ﬁeld of vision
once again. Seated at the seat of honor, The Fool, who was obscured
by the thick fog, presented himself in front of him once more.
Klein was satisﬁed that his “summoning” wasn’t interrupted. He also
conﬁrmed that he didn’t face any immediate danger.
“Sun, we meet again,” he said smilingly, using Jotun.
Derrick was shocked by what had happened. He lowered his head.
“You are a Fool who keeps his word.”
“The other members will arrive in a while. Before that, I’ll conﬁrm a
few things with you ﬁrst.” Klein used the Loen language this time,
but willed the mysterious space to translate it into Jotun.
The words rang through the air, coming to Derrick in Jotun. He asked
curiously,
“What’s the matter?”
Well, now that I’ve gained a certain degree of mastery over Jotun, the
mysterious space above the gray fog can translate whatever I say in real
time. This means that I won’t have to worry about Justice and The
Hanged Man not understanding whatever Sun says… Sigh, why does a
boss like me have to work so tirelessly? Klein pinched the bridge of his
nose. He laughed and shook his head.
“I’ll permit you to recite my name; remember the incantations I’m
going to tell you.”
“The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era, the mysterious ruler above
the gray fog; the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck”
Derrick’s pupils constricted when he heard that, but he didn’t dare to
get distracted. He recited it over and over again in his heart, then
conﬁrmed it with The Fool.
“You have to use a simple ritual and recite my name whenever you
return to the City of Silver… I will notify you in advance for future
gatherings. You need not pay too much attention to it on other days,
nor do you have to avoid anyone. When you receive my notiﬁcation,
isolate yourself within a thousand heartbeats.” Klein told him the
method he had been deliberating on for quite some time.
This was essentially a response to a prayer.
As he had to consider the situation regarding the City of Silver, as
well as save time, Klein opted to omit the other steps of the ritual
since it was a plea directed toward him.
“A thousand heartbeats?” Derrick muttered to himself.
Klein described the general idea of the Tarot Club to Derrick, then
took out his pocket watch and looked at the time.
Derrick froze for a while, instinctively looking at the wondrous item.
When three approached, Klein extended his hand and pressed on the
dark red stars representing Justice and The Hanged Man.
Derrick didn’t blink as he witnessed this. He saw light burst forth
opposite and beside him, as two hazy ﬁgures extended from within.
Audrey Hall surveyed her surroundings and froze suddenly. She then
heard the ever-calm voice of Mr. Fool.
“This is our newest member, his code name is Sun.”
“This is Miss Justice, and that is Mr. Hanged Man.”
Newest member? Audrey was shocked at ﬁrst, then her shock
immediately turned to joy.
She was very excited to see the development of the Tarot Club. She
felt like a protagonist.
The Hanged Man Alger creased his brows, a little upset that The Fool
would drag in a new member so suddenly.
He should’ve at least mentioned it to us… But a great ﬁgure like Mr. Fool
wouldn’t have to care about our feelings… He thought in exasperation
before giving a simple greeting to Justice and Sun.
In this short process, Audrey entered the her Spectator state and paid
close attention to the newest member Sun.
“He should be quite young… His body language tells me that he’s a
little nervous and restrained… But he ultimately maintains a
tolerable air of silence, giving the feeling of, hmm, a lone wolf, yes, a
lone wolf…” Audrey thought as she cast her gaze at The Fool who
was seated at the end of the long bronze table.
She said in joy, “Mr. Fool, I’ve collected another two pages of
Emperor Roselle’s diary.”
Chapter 144: Three-Way Deal
Actually there were three pages, but the characters were too complicated
and too diﬃcult to memorize. My limit is only a little over two pages. I
would mess up if I were to memorize more. The rest will have to wait until
the next gathering… Audrey added in her head.
New pages of Roselle’s diary? Klein’s mind stirred. He smiled and asked
in reply when he already knew the answer, “Miss Justice, what do
you need?”
Audrey’s eyes beamed with excitement, but she replied in a reserved
manner, “You know that I’ll soon fully digest the Spectator potion. I
hope that I can get the formula for the Telepathist potion so that I
can prepare the ingredients ahead of time. Hmm, I know that there
isn’t much content for two pages of the diary, and it might not equal
to the value of the Telepathist formula, so I’ll give you another page,
hmm, I’ll also pay you a sum of money on the side…”
She had yet to ﬁnish what she said when she suddenly felt that it had
come out wrong. She couldn’t help but berate herself in her head, Mr.
Fool is at the very least an important ﬁgure which approaches that of a
god, how could he be bought over by money?!
Hence, Audrey couldn’t maintain her Spectator state as she hurriedly
added with a stammer, “That’s not what I meant! Mr. Fool, what I
meant is that you can determine the compensation that you’d like.
Yes, that’s what I meant!”
I like your earlier suggestion… I would answer like this: When you have
fully digested the Spectator potion, you will get the formula you need. I
have a subordinate, no, I have to use the word “adorer” that sounds more
awesome. He happens to be handling some matters that require money,
and this is his anonymous account in Backlund Bank… Yes, then I will
disguise myself and make an anonymous account in Backlund Bank.
Klein didn’t answer immediately but weighed his words carefully
with an unfathomable expression.
Backlund Bank was one of the seven major banks in the Loen
Kingdom, and as such, it possessed the right to clear transactions.
The Loen Kingdom settled accounts with receipts to take care of cash
transfer business between banks within the same city in a centralized
manner. However, unlike banks in the Intis Republic, not all banks
were part of the same league. The biggest seven banks held on to
these rights. Hence, they were called the clearance banks, making
other banks rely on them.
Transferring money from a diﬀerent location, on the other hand,
could only be done within the same bank. It would be completed by
squaring accounts between branches. With the invention of the steam
locomotive and telegram, the eﬃciency of these transfers had been
enhanced drastically.
Just then, The Sun, Derrick Berg, suddenly spoke.
“The Telepathist potion formula? Telepathist that is followed by
Psyche Analyst?”
Audrey looked towards him puzzledly. “You know of it?”
At the same time, Miss Justice saw a problem through her instinct as
a Spectator.
The young man had used the ancient title “Psyche Analyst” instead of
the modern term, “Psychiatrist!”
This guy is very strange… Audrey examined Sun’s every movement.
Derrick didn’t think that he behaved any diﬀerently but replied
seriously, “I can get you the formula!”
Then, he felt guilty as he couldn’t provide it immediately. He tried
his best to explain himself, “It’s a Sequence pathway that stemmed
from the Dragon race. And our City of Silver was once ruled by the
Giant King’s imperial household. As you know, the Giants and the
Dragons are sworn enemies. Hence, the City of Silver has all of
Sequence 9, 8, and 7. I have ways to get them.”
This kid… I already warned him not to speak carelessly or expose his
origins. In the end… Klein nearly wanted to extend his hand to cover
his face.
Sigh, although The Sun appears to be in great pain, very mature and silent
for his age, he’s just a boy after all! However, that clariﬁes one thing for
me… It turns out that the Spectator Sequence’s origins stem from the
Dragon race. It’s no wonder that the symbol formed by stars behind Miss
Justice’s high chair is the Dragon… The City of Silver has preserved
history well… Klein maintained his posture of leaning against the back
of his chair while he listened thoughtfully to The Sun’s description.
In fact, he could’ve easily stopped The Sun from exposing those
matters. As long as he didn’t help in the simultaneous translation,
Justice and The Hanged Man wouldn’t have understood him at all.
However, Klein took a diﬀerent approach. He felt that it might help
him consolidate his mighty and mysterious image in the minds of the
three members eﬀectively. Hence, he listened with a smile and didn’t
make a sound.
Giant King, Dragon race, the City of Silver… Audrey was confused. She
ﬁrst took a look at The Hanged Man opposite her, but she could tell
that he was shocked and confused as well from his body language.
She looked sideways towards the seat of honor on the long bronze
table. She saw The Fool sitting on the high chair, engulfed in thick
grayish-white fog. His right arm was placed on the armrest while he
leaned sideways leisurely. He showed no shock, no curiosity, no
thoughts, and no doubt. He only looked at them with a smile.
He knows… He knew all of this… Audrey and Alger made the deﬁnite
judgment almost at the same time.
“The City of Silver, I’ve never heard of this place… Where is it?”
Audrey probed while Alger listened attentively.
At that very moment, Derrick Berg’s head was ﬁlled with questions as
well. He could tell that, besides the godlike Fool, Justice and The
Hanged Man were some sort of Beyonder.
In the Forsaken Land of the Gods, besides the people in the City of
Silver, Derrick had never seen another living human.
So, he asked in reply, “If you aren’t residents of the City of Silver,
which city-state are you from?”
Sigh… Klein couldn’t help but wish to sigh again.
Audrey trembled her lips, momentarily at a loss for words.
Yes, the hidden meaning behind his question is that if you don’t want to
answer a similar question, don’t pry into the questions about where the
other person lives…Miss Justice nodded faintly and elegantly kept
quiet.
Obviously, Alger had misunderstood The Sun’s intentions as well. He
didn’t know the other person was really just asking straightforwardly.
So, he kept quiet too.
When Derrick didn’t receive any reply, he seemed to realize what was
happening. He didn’t bring it up again and instead said,
“I will try to get the Telepathist potion formula as soon as possible. I
would like to use it to exchange for the beginning Sequence pathway
of the Sun.”
“Sun Sequence pathway? Sequence 9 Bard?” Alger asked in reply.
Derrick thought and said, “Probably, but I lack information about it.”
Klein who was watching from the side decided to get involved,
because he didn’t want to risk anyone taking his business away.
He smiled and said, “I believe Miss Justice doesn’t have the Bard
formula.”
But Mr. Hanged Man seems to be able to get it…
Seeing Audrey nod, Klein continued with a faint smile, “I will give
The Sun the Bard formula. The Sun will pass the Telepathist potion to
Miss Justice as soon as possible. Try to get it done within the next
two Gatherings. Miss Justice, please pass me the new pages of
Roselle’s diary. Then, the deal is done.”
“Yes, according to the law of equivalent exchange, The Sun is on the
losing end of this transaction, but as of now, he has only made a
promise. When he really provides the Telepathist formula, Miss
Justice can consider how to compensate him again, or I will
compensate him while Miss Justice provides money to one of my
adorers who needs to do somethings recently. Heh heh, that’s
because The Sun might not necessarily be able to receive Miss
Justice’s cash or ingredients as compensation.”
Klein intentionally added that ﬁnal statement to redirect The Hanged
Man and Justice’s focus onto the fact that Sun might not be able to
receive her compensation. He also did that to place himself in an
unfathomable position; then, everyone would ignore the adorer that
lacked money.
Might not necessarily receive the compensation… Where exactly is The
Sun? The Southern Continent? Alger suddenly creased his eyebrows.
The origin of The Sun is mysterious too… As expected, Mr. Fool does have
subordinates in reality. Audrey ﬁnally saw her hope of becoming a
Sequence 8 Telepathist. What other thoughts could she have? She
suppressed her excitement and ﬂashed a faint smile as she said, “I
have no objections.”
“Neither do I.” When Derrick saw that he could obtain the beginning
sequence of the Sun pathway, he nodded without hesitation. He
couldn’t care less about the additional compensation.
Alger, who was out of the three-way deal, didn’t have the right to
speak. Although he could get the formula of Bard, he would need to
wait a week or two as well.
At that moment, Klein, who had successfully delayed the
compensation to the next Gathering, or the following one after,
pressed his palm forward happily. The Bard formula surfaced.
“Main ingredients: a Crystal Sunﬂower or an adult Flint Bird’s tail
feather or a Fire Bird’s tail feather… A piece of Siren Rock or a
Singing Sunﬂower…
Supplementary ingredients: a blade of Midsummer Grass, 5 drops of
July Wine Juice, a blade of Elf Dark Leaf…”
He sent the formula before The Sun and saw the young man ﬁrst
crease his eyebrows and then relax.
Yes, the ingredients in the Forsaken Land of the Gods will still be known
by their ancient names. Luckily, my formula was obtained directly from
the Eternal Blazing Sun. The knowledge that I gained used ancient names
and various replacements…Klein suddenly cast his eyes of realization
towards Miss Justice.
Audrey looked at The Sun who was memorizing the formula, then she
quickly willed the two pages of the diary that she had memorized.
The diary immediately appeared on the yellowish-brown goatskin
and, with a ﬂash, appeared in Klein’s hands.
Just like before, he started reading immediately.
“3rd November, Matilda is three months pregnant now. I even ﬁnd
those maidservants who come from the villages beautiful. No, I can’t
lower my standards. Coincidently, Countess Florais has invited me to
join a private party, hehe.
“8th November, Archbishop Fan Estin sought my help. Huh, what can
I do for an archbishop?
“9th November, it turns out that there is actually a secret hidden
within Sequence pathways. Archbishop Estin told me that after
becoming a Sequence 5 Beyonder, the rest of the Sequences could be
replaced with Sequences of the same level from one or two other
pathways! In other words, it starts from the Mid-Sequence to High-
Sequence! But this is only limited between those one or two
pathways. If it’s replaced with a potion from a wrong pathway, semi-
insanity is the mildest outcome, and one can’t advance any further.
“This way, one can begin substituting pathways from Sequence 4
onwards. Sleepless and Corpse Collector pathways. Yes, the Church’s
Savant and Mystery Pryer pathways can also substitute for one
another at a High Sequence.”
Chapter 145: Request for
Cooperation
Some pathways are interchangeable after Sequence 5? That’s diﬀerent
from what the Nighthawks told me!
Isn’t it a fact that you cannot change your pathway after you choose one?
Wasn’t it mentioned that diverging from your pathway would allow one to
obtain strange, mysterious powers, but that person would deﬁnitely go
insane and would never be able to advance?
To think that there are some hidden exceptions to this!
Klein looked at the diary, his pupils constricting.
He didn’t think that the Emperor Roselle would spout nonsense about
something like this. After all, the surprise in his words were so real.
But he didn’t assume that the information Emperor Roselle had
received was deﬁnitely correct. There was also a possibility that he
had been lied to, or that he had misinterpreted the information.
I will need to verify this. I’ll commit it to my memory ﬁrst… Klein
reminded himself, then thought deeply about this.
If what Roselle described here turns out to be correct, then the Sequence
pathways go deeper than what I imagined… It hides many secrets…
The complete pathway possessed by the Nighthawks is Sleepless. They also
possess a relatively complete path in the Corpse Collector, which they have
up to Sequence 4. To think that those are interchangeable after Sequence
5… The other potion chains they have are even less complete, as some
pathways only possess the ﬁrst Sequence…
Similarly, the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery holds the
complete pathway of the Savant, and has a relatively complete pathway
for the Mystery Pryer. These can also be interchanged at High
Sequences…
Interesting… I wonder which pathway is interchangeable with the Seer
pathway? The Apprentice or Marauder that was mentioned by the
Emperor?
Hmm, there’s a high possibility that the ﬁrst ﬁve Sequence pathways of the
Seer pathway would each provide a separate ability, and that these
abilities would be combined at Sequence 4. At that stage, there should be
no way to interchange it with some other potion… Klein retracted his
thoughts, once again placing his attention onto the diary.
He noticed that although the two diary pages were connected, the
content was not in chronological order. The dates belonged to two
diﬀerent periods. This could be a mistake made by whoever copied
their content.
“9th April. The relationships between the Church of the Eternal
Blazing Sun, the Church of the Lord of Storms, and the Church of the
God of Knowledge and Wisdom are poor. They see each other as
enemies. The Church of the Evernight Goddess is at odds with the
Church of the God of Combat from the Feysac Empire. This can be
taken advantage of. These are all facts worth considering.”
“13th April. I participated in an ancient organization’s gathering. I
never expected them to be members of this organization as well. It
sure was frightening.”
“To think that the second Blasphemy Slate was in the hands of this
organization. This is the ﬁrst time I’m seeing this legendary item!”
“Indeed, it was hiding an unimaginable secret, hehe. Perhaps there
will come a day when I will create a Blasphemy Slate unique to me.
No, a set of them, with each one hiding an ultimate secret!”
Holy f**k, Emperor, why didn’t you specify the name of this ancient
organization!? You’re killing me! Perhaps—perhaps, Roselle had a reason,
or didn’t dare to write down the name of the organization, even if he was
using Chinese… Klein looked at the diary, a little uncomfortable and
puzzled.
But with this page of the diary, Klein could ﬁnally conﬁrm that
Emperor Roselle had seen the second Blasphemy Slate. Furthermore,
he created a set of cards after that, each card represented a pathway
to godhood.
Yes, that could be the ultimate secret that matches each pathway to
godhood. I wonder where that set of twenty-two cards are now? That
ancient organization managed to obtain the second Blasphemy Slate…
Klein’s thoughts ﬂowed quickly.
But he quickly reined in his thoughts. He shifted his gaze away from
the diary and shot it towards The Hanged Man, Justice, and The Sun.
He smiled and said, “Actually, you didn’t need to wait for me.”
“It’s our honor.” Alger had already reined in his dissatisfaction as he
answered humbly.
Audrey thought for a moment before smiling.
“Mr. Fool, the open selection of government oﬃcials through
examinations that you described previously has already garnered the
support of the King and the Prime Minister. It will soon be passed by
the House of Lords and the House of Commons and is predicted to be
implemented early next year.”
“It looks like the King and the Prime Minister still use their brains,”
Alger mocked out of habit.
Well, with Benson’s intellect and diligence, his grammatical and
accounting skills should be passable by early next year… But once it’s
passed by the two Houses, it will deﬁnitely be announced widely by the
various newspapers. I wonder how long Benson’s advantage will last? The
earlier the examination, the better…
Sigh, there’s no way Benson can triumph over the elites who graduated
from the various universities in such a short period of time. But he need
not compete against them; the positions they’re ﬁghting for wouldn’t be the
same. Those people might only have their sights trained on positions such
as the Cabinet secretary, or Finance secretary… The silent Klein worried
for his brother as he nodded his head with a smile.
Audrey straightened her back when she saw The Fool’s aﬃrmative
nod. She said with a smile, “Mr. Hanged Man, you got me to check
on something for you previously. I’ve received an answer. The King
has been convinced by the Prime Minister and won’t seek revenge on
the Feysac Empire at the East Balam Shore for the time being. I think
you can now give me the extra payment that you promised me.”
Alger thought for a few seconds before saying, “Miss Justice, thank
you for your answer. This eases my concerns over certain things.
What kind of extra payment do you want? I’ll consider it if it’s within
reason.”
Audrey smiled, obviously prepared.
“Clues to the Psychology Alchemists, or clues to the main ingredients
of the potion Telepathist. Of course, that can wait until after The Sun
hands the formula over to me.”
“No problem,” Alger said without hesitation.
Two seats away from The Hanged Man, Derrick Berg couldn’t
understand a single word. He was very confused, feeling that he only
understood a few terms, but couldn’t string them together to provide
any logical sense.
A method of selecting oﬃcials through examination? A King and Prime
Minister, House of Lords, House of Commons, East Balam Shore, Feysac
Empire, Psychology Alchemists? He understood none of that.
Feysac, the root of the word came from Jotun. What connection did it
have with the fallen Giant King’s imperial household? Derrick looked at
Justice and The Hanged Man, suddenly having the feeling that they
might not come from the same world.
Could there be another city-state, or one that had formed a nation,
somewhere far away from the City of Silver in the cursed lands? Derrick
remained silent and listened on. He had a faint understanding of why
the mysterious Fool mentioned that he might not be able to receive
the monetary compensation Justice was going to give him.
To be able to gather people this far away from each other, disregarding
the terrifying monsters hiding in the darkness of the cursed lands, The Fool
might really be a god, an ancient god… he thought.
After accomplishing everything that she set out to do, Audrey wanted
to become a silent observer, but she suddenly remembered
something. She spoke in a hurry, “I recently came into contact with a
Beyonder circle and found out about a powerful person named Mr. A.
Mr. Fool, Mr. Hanged Man, Mr. Sun, do you know of this person’s
background and identity?”
I don’t even know what you’re talking about… Derrick maintained his
silence.
Mr. A? I only know a Mr. Z… With such a similar code name, could he
also be from the Aurora Order? Klein made a guess, but didn’t give an
answer.
He had to maintain his image and try not to give answers he wasn’t
conﬁdent in. If he had to, he would give a vague description just like
a charlatan.
Alger looked at The Fool and found him calm and unchanging. It was
hard to read his true thoughts. Thus, he said in a deliberative tone,
“The Aurora Order is at odds with the Church of the Lord of Storms,
the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun, and the Church of the God of
Knowledge and Wisdom, so members of these Churches understand
the Aurora Order more than any other organization. And I happen to
know something about them.”
You need not explain, I know that you come under the Lord of Storms. Of
course, you could be a whistleblower… But why would there be hatred
between the Aurora Order and the three ancient Churches? Klein smiled
but didn’t speak. He looked calmly at The Hanged Man.
Alger knew that he couldn’t hide his Sequence pathway from The
Fool, but didn’t pay too much attention to it and continued.
“The Aurora Order has ﬁve Saints and twenty-two Oracles. These
Oracles use the alphabet as their code names, from Mr. A to Mr. X.
They are Beyonders, with the weakest being Sequence 7 and the
strongest Sequence 5. They are all adept at hiding themselves. Should
a Oracle die, a new Oracle will take their place.”
“I cannot guarantee that the Mr. A you spoke of is the Mr. A from the
Aurora Order, but there is a good possibility. As for the details of the
Aurora Order, I have mentioned that to you before.”
Audrey nodded, becoming even more cautious of Mr. A.
She said, feeling a little pinch in her heart, “Thank you for your
answer, Mr. Hanged Man. You need not make a payment anymore.”
“No, I wish to ask for your help with the answer just now, as well as
provide extra compensation,” Alger said with a deep voice.
“What help?” Audrey asked curiously.
Alger thought for a few seconds before saying, “I received
intelligence that the pirate Qilangos, codenamed Rear Admiral
Hurricane, has secretly gone onshore and inﬁltrated Backlund. I don’t
know what he’s up to, but I hope that you can help me locate his
whereabouts. As for whatever happens afterwards, you need not put
yourself in danger.”
“Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos? One of the seven great admiral
pirates?” Audrey widened her eyes, almost unable to maintain her
Spectator state.
What was the thing she wanted to do the most after she became a
Beyonder? It was, of course, to interact with the people that only
existed in the fables of the nobles!
“Yes, he’s a Sequence 6 Beyonder of the path of the Sailor, a Wind-
blessed. He also has a miraculous item that could be classiﬁed as a
Sealed Artifact. He’s quite crafty and cruel. Don’t attempt to deal
with him,” Alger introduced seriously.
He suddenly turned to Klein.
“Mr. Fool, can I get your adorer to assist me at the critical moment? I
would pay a price that interests you.”
The only adorer I have is myself… Klein lampooned to ease his
emotions as he smiled.
“That is built on the premise that my adorer happens to be in
Backlund.”
“Alright.” Alger retracted his gaze, a little disappointed, but also a
little expectant.
Chapter 146: Creeping Hunger
“What’s so special about Qilangos’s magical item?” Audrey asked
slightly conﬁdently.
She considered it carefully and suddenly realized that she had a
decent ability to locate people in Backlund.
Firstly, her father was one of the most wealthy, connected, and
reputable nobles, while she was quite popular amongst the younger
generation too. Hence, in the upper-middle class of the society, she
had quite a few resources to take advantage of.
Secondly, the two Beyonders that she knew had their own circles as
well. Apprentice Fors was originally a clinical doctor, and was now
an author. She knew quite a number of people in the literary world
and publishing industry, as well as among the middle-class doctors.
Arbiter Xio Derecha had helped many middle-lower class people to
coordinate and mediate disputes over a long period of time. She was
also quite famous in East Backlund borough among the working class
and maﬁa. She had a lot of hidden channels.
Plus, considering the Beyonders that they knew and their circles of
inﬂuence, their ability to look for a person wasn’t to be belittled.
Towards Justice’s question, Alger answered almost straightaway
without hesitation or thought.
“No one knows the real name of the magical item, but the people
who have come into contact with it call it the ‘Creeping Hunger.’
Qilangos uses a living person’s soul and ﬂesh to satisfy it every other
day. Otherwise, it would consume its owner as a replacement.”
“This could be one of the most important clues to seek out Qilangos,”
Audrey said, creasing her eyebrows.
She felt utter discomfort and extreme hatred towards any evil item
that desired a living human’s fresh blood and soul.
“Yes, but in a big city with at least ﬁve million people, a few vagrants
going missing wouldn’t be noticed,” Alger reminded her. “Ever since
he got his hands on the Creeping Hunger, Qilangos has been very
diﬃcult to deal with.”
“He was originally a Wind-blessed. He possesses great Beyonder
power in domains related to water, wind, and the weather. But, later
on, people realized that he could drive his targets crazy, enter the
dreams of others, summon light to purify a dead soul, sing to
strengthen himself, and change his appearance… There’s almost
nothing that he can’t do,” Alger described in detail. “We suspect that
those are all eﬀects that came from the magical item, Creeping
Hunger…”
Before he ﬁnished sharing, Derrick Berg, who had been listening
quietly, suddenly blurted, “Shepherd!”
Shepherd? Sequence 5 of the Secrets Suppliant and Listener pathway?
Hmm, among the six-member council in the City of Silver, there is a new
elder who’s a Shepherd. Sun had mentioned that she’s strong enough to
ﬁght against a Sequence 4 expert, well—an evil spirit of the same grade…
Klein’s expression changed slightly, but it was covered by the gray
fog. Justice wasn’t paying any attention to him either.
“Shepherd?”
“Shepherd?”
Justice and The Hanged Man asked in unison. One sounded
completely confused while the other sounded shocked, as though
they had heard the title of Shepherd elsewhere before and knew
something about it, but didn’t understand the actual situation.
Seeing that everyone was staring at him, Derrick suddenly panicked a
little. No matter how quiet, depressed, and vexed he was, he was a
boy after all.
He hurriedly explained with a stammer, “What I meant was, the traits
that The Hanged Man described were like the Beyonder power of the
Sequence job, Shepherd. Every Shepherd can swallow another’s soul
into their body, including wraiths and evil spirits. They control these
souls to do their bidding with a unique method, which allows them to
make use of their abilities, just like a god letting his lambs out to
graze.
“Hence, no one knows how many powers a Shepherd has. That
depends on how many Beyonder souls they have swallowed, and that
makes them very scary. They’re almost like a High-Sequence
Beyonder.
“However, there are people who suspect that there’s a limit to the
number of souls that a Shepherd can consume and let out to graze,
and that the souls inside them could be replaced as well.”
So that’s what being a Shepherd means… The Sequence pathway that the
Aurora Order has in its control is enigmatic… No wonder they worship
the True Creator, no, the Fallen Creator… Klein was suddenly
enlightened, but he didn’t nod, taking on the appearance that he
knew so long ago.
Meanwhile, he sighed inwardly. Sun, you are a boy after all. This is
very important information, very important insight. You could’ve
exchanged it for valuable things, but you just revealed it all! Just like
that…
Yes, the ability demonstrated by the magical item Creeping Hunger is
similar to a Sequence 5 Shepherd… I wonder if other Sealed Artifacts
have the same powers of Beyonders? I wonder which Sequence the Sealed
Artifact 2-049, the Antigonus family’s puppet, resembles…
After listening to Sun’s explanation, Alger seemed to have sorted out
the puzzle in his mind as he nodded in silence.
Audrey got even more curious and pressed, “Which Sequence
pathway is Shepherd from? Which number is it?”
“The Secrets Suppliant pathway, Sequence 5.” Klein seized the
opportunity to answer so as to demonstrate that he knew everything.
“Secrets Suppliant… Aurora Order…” Audrey suddenly recalled Mr.
A, who was a suspected Oracle of the Aurora Order, and she
immediately felt heavy-hearted.
She started thinking seriously, thinking of what price she could pay
in exchange for Mr. Fool to take action and rid oﬀ that disgusting
fellow eﬀortlessly. However, she couldn’t think of anything that
would move Mr. Fool into doing so.
As expected, a ﬁgure akin to a god wouldn’t be easily moved… There
aren’t many things and matters that would garner their interest after all…
Audrey sighed.
Putting her impulse aside, she nodded to The Sun gratefully, thanking
him for giving them a new perspective on Creeping Hunger, so that
they could deal with it more reasonably and eﬃciently.
“Mr. Hanged Man, I’m willing to accept the mission. But I can’t
guarantee if I can ﬁnd Rear Admiral Hurricane, Qilangos.” Audrey
looked opposite her when she spoke.
“There’s no better answer than this. Regardless of your success, as
long as you try, I will deﬁnitely compensate you with things like
secret information or intelligence. And if you succeed, maybe I could
provide you the Telepathist’s main ingredients directly. Of course, the
prerequisite is that we have to know what it is,” Alger promised
generously, which was a rare sight.
“Deal,” Audrey pursed her lips and replied with a faint smile.
Then, Alger created Qilangos’ portrait with Klein’s permission and
assistance.
He was one of the seven major pirate admirals. He had a distinctive
broad chin, brown hair tied into a bun at the back of his head like an
ancient warrior, and green eyes that seemed to hint at laughter, but
were abnormally cold..
After they ﬁnished their discussion and shared their insights, Klein
smiled as he announced the ending of the Gathering. He saw Justice
and The Hanged Man get up swiftly from their seats and bow while
The Sun mimicked their motions, only slower.
He pressed forward with his right hand and severed the connection,
but he didn’t leave immediately.
…
In the Berg household in the City of Silver.
Derrick looked at his familiar surroundings and glanced outside at
the dark sky that had ﬂashes of lightning. He was momentarily
thrown into a trance.
But he soon jolted to his senses. He searched for goatskin and a quill
before writing down the Bard formula he memorized.
He looked at it several times and was ﬁnally certain that there was
nothing wrong with it.
Derrick wasn’t worried that possessing the Bard formula and
becoming a diﬀerent Beyonder would gain the suspicion of the upper
echelons of the City of Silver. This was because in past exploratory
expeditions, members of those elite troops would often collect some
formulas, ingredients, and strange artifacts from the monsters in the
abandoned and destroyed cities.
During this process, it was normal that people kept some of the loot
privately. As long as it didn’t involve anything too important, the
captains and higher-ups would tacitly overlook it.
Over time, some formulas started going around through non-oﬃcial
channels within the City of Silver. Some became the foundation of
strong families from generation to generation. The Things of the Dark
surrounding the City of Silver were relatively ﬁxed. Some ingredients
could be obtained easily while some could only be encountered if one
went far into the cursed land.
Putting aside the goatskin, Derrick recalled the mysterious Fool’s
instructions. Hence, in his simple bedroom, he lowered his head and
simply prayed,
“The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era.”
“The mysterious ruler above the gray fog.”
“The King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.”
…
Jotun was a very ancient language. It came equipped with the
mystical properties demanded by rituals, prayers, and spell casting;
therefore, Derrick didn’t need to change the incantations into ancient
Hermes.
…
“The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era.”
…
Klein, who was seated at the seat of honor at the long bronze table,
suddenly heard prayers reverberating in his ears. He then saw the
crimson star that corresponded to Sun blinking.
He didn’t try to touch it, but planned to reply to him ten minutes
before the next Gathering so that the City of Silver youth would make
preparations to be alone.
The most important part was for him to evade the conversion of time
and date, to decrease the possibility of damaging Fool’s mighty
image.
After he conﬁrmed that, Klein wrapped himself up with spirituality
and stimulated a descent.
Returning to his room, Klein removed the spirituality wall and took a
break before he got ready to head out again.
It wasn’t necessary for him to play the role of a Seer, and he didn’t
have to ﬁx his trip to the Divination Club into his daily schedule. He
would only visit occasionally to make some extra pocket money and
fulﬁll his supervision as a Nighthawk.
Originally, Klein wanted to laze around through the entire afternoon,
but he suddenly thought of something that he had yet to do. So, he
had no choice but to gather himself up. According to his
appointment, he had to pay Detective Henry a visit that day and
accept the ﬁnal report about the red chimney investigation.
Sigh. I’ve heard that the big timers are all quite busy… I still have to spare
some time to go to the Tingen Family Servant Assistance Association with
Benson and Melissa to look for a good maidservant… Klein unwillingly
changed his shirt, put on his black tuxedo, and held his silk top hat
and silver-inlaid cane before walking out the door like a gentleman.
At Besik Street, under Henry’s Private Detective Company, Klein put
on a mask and lowered his hat as he went across the street quickly
and entered the stairway.
Chapter 147: Night Visitor
In the oﬃce of the private investigator.
“Sir, your request has been completed,” Detective Henry said to the
gentleman in front of him with his hoarse voice. He heaved a sigh of
relief. “This wasn’t an easy mission, nor was it too diﬃcult, but it
used up a great deal of our resources and energy. To be honest, I’m a
little regretful. I regret setting too low a price for this mission.”
No, no matter what you say, I will not pay a single penny more! Klein
emphasized in his heart. He pointed at the thick stack of documents
on the coﬀee table and asked, “Is this the investigation report?”
“Yes.” Henry pressed on the report that had at least sixty pages and
sighed. “This is the most troublesome report that I’ve completed…”
He hadn’t even ﬁnished his sentence when he saw Klein hand over
four pounds in cash. His attention shifted to determining the
authenticity of the notes.
“This is the remainder of the fees.” Klein held the thick stack of
notes.
Henry coughed.
“You sure are a gentleman that keeps to his word. Sigh. I didn’t
expect the investigation report to use this many pieces of paper. It
was completely out of my budget.”
At that moment, Klein took the thick investigation report and stood
up.
He gave a slight bow and immediately made his way to the door with
his cane in hand.
Detective Henry’s last sentence was left stuck in his throat.
Hey, how can you expect me to pay for the paper used in the
investigation report? That should be included in the fees already!
Klein touched the ﬁve pounds eight soli he had left and muttered in
his heart. He walked quickly onto Besik Street.
He surveyed the surroundings and conﬁrmed that no one was paying
attention to him before leaving the place. He found an opportunity to
remove his mask.
Klein didn’t intend to head home right away. He wanted to search for
a cafe and organize the investigation report. He wanted to ﬁnd the
houses that had a change in tenants after divining the red chimney.
He could then conduct his search before dinner.
There were many cafes in the area, but none of them met Klein’s
criteria. Ever since steam and machinery became the symbol of the
times, more and more cafes had toned down on their decor and
become something like cheap restaurants. They provided
refreshments, coﬀee, bread, and dishes like pea and mutton stew to
the busy workers. Thus, respectable ladies and gentlemen no longer
went to cafes to discuss things. They no longer viewed these actions
as being symbolic of their status. Various clubs started appearing and
replaced cafes as a place for socializing.
After some time, Klein ﬁnally found a cafe that had a decent
atmosphere.
He sat in a secluded corner and took a sip of his one-penny Southville
Coﬀee before ﬂipping open the investigation report.
“In Tingen City’s North Borough, South Borough, East Borough, West
Borough, Golden Indus, Harbor Borough, and University Borough,
there are a total of 1179 buildings that have a dark red chimney…
Along the outskirts of Tingen City, there are a total of 546 buildings
with the red chimney the requester described. This doesn’t include
buildings in towns or villages that are relatively further away despite
them falling under the jurisdiction of Tingen.”
“Below are the addresses and tenant records of each of those
buildings. As per the request, the activities within the last three
months are recorded in more detail.”
…
Klein ﬂipped through page after page, occasionally making notes on
paper he brought around with a fountain pen.
Finally, when he found the type of red chimney he had seen, he
realized that there was a change of tenants in twenty-ﬁve buildings.
That’s not too many. I should try to ﬁnish my investigations within
two days. After all, I’ve seen that red chimney and parts of the house
in my dream. My spiritual sense would have a feeling of familiarity
when I see those signs again. I’ll conﬁrm the target that way. In other
words, I’m a living investigation machine… Klein nodded. He split
the buildings based on their location and planned to investigate
ﬁfteen of them that day.
He didn’t need to do a divination to get an answer if these
investigations would prove dangerous.
Since there was a change of tenants, that would mean that the
mastermind behind the coincidences had already left!
Let’s hope that the new tenants know what the previous tenants look
like… But since the person behind the scenes can control my fate
without anyone noticing, to the point of making the coincidences feel
so natural, he would deﬁnitely have a way to remove any traces he
might have left behind… Sigh, I can only pray to the Goddess and
hope that he left behind some sort of clue… Klein sighed. He pumped
himself up and put on his hat. He then grabbed his cane and the
report before leaving the cafe.
Klein spent two soli on a rented carriage and visited ﬁfteen buildings
with the red chimneys before dinner. Unfortunately, none of the
buildings was the one he saw in his dream.
It would be quite troublesome if tomorrow’s investigation yields the
same result. He might still be living in the house with the red
chimney even after I saw it in my divination. This could say that he is
very conﬁdent and isn’t afraid of my investigation; in fact, he might
not even be afraid of the Tingen Nighthawks. Or perhaps, he doesn’t
know that he’s been exposed. That would mean that the power
resisting my divination was a power not belonging to him… Klein
stood in front of 2 Daﬀodil Street and analyzed the various
possibilities.
A few minutes later, he patted down his tuxedo and pressed on his
hat before taking out his key and entering the house with a smile.
He intended to prepare stewed mutton and honey glazed barbecue
for Benson and Melissa that night.
…
At eleven in the evening, the siblings bade each other goodnight and
returned to their respective rooms.
Klein closed the door to his room and stood before his desk. He
looked outside the oriel window with the light of his gas lamp. At
that moment, the streets were engulfed in darkness, with only a few
street lamps illuminating the way. Stars dotted the screen that was
the night sky. There were many stars, they were just not clearly
visible.
“I wonder what Backlund is like, with its titles of the Land of Hope
and the Capital of Capitals…” Klein muttered to himself. He extended
his hand to grab his curtain, intending to draw it.
Woo!
At that moment, a sinister wind blew at him without warning. The
light from his lamp turned a dark green.
Klein subconsciously took a few steps back. His occupational instincts
made him tap his left molars twice. At the same time, he leaned
toward the bed and tried to reach for his revolver under his pillow.
In his vision, a face suddenly protruded from the wall above the desk
and under the gas lamp. It was a translucent face without any eyes or
nose. All it had was a mouth!
“Do not ﬁre.” The face with a mouth spoke.
It can communicate? Klein already had his revolver in hand as he
took aim.
“What do you want?” he asked in a deep voice.
The face chuckled.
“I’m Daly.”
Daly? Spirit Medium Daly? The Spirit Medium Daly who was sent to
the Backlund diocese? Klein raised his brows in doubt.
“Madam Daly?”
“I know that this method of visiting you is a little rude. I should’ve
given you a warning so you could make the necessary preparations.
But it isn’t convenient for me to meet you right now, and so, I can
only communicate with you using this little guy.” The translucent
face laughed.
Even though the voice is diﬀerent and jarring, the manner of speech
is indeed Madam Daly’s style. The abilities of a Spirit Medium sure
are cool… Klein reﬂected wistfully. He didn’t lower his revolver as he
asked, “Madam, what do you want to talk about with me?”
“If I were you, I would ﬁrst seal the bedroom with spirituality.
Otherwise, your family members might think of you as crazy.” The
translucent face quipped, “Heh heh, you need not be so cautious. I
came back to Tingen in secret because of Dunn’s letter. You know
that a Nighthawk cannot leave the area they are assigned to at will.”
“The Captain’s letter?” Klein didn’t approach the desk. Instead, he felt
for the Holy Night Powder he had in the hidden pocket of his black
windbreaker.
“Dunn and I are both Beyonders that started with the Tingen
Nighthawks. We have always maintained a good relationship. Last
Thursday, yes, Thursday, he sent me a letter and mentioned you. He
said that you emulated the maxim of a Mystery Pryer, came up with
a set of rules for a Seer, and claimed that it was eﬀective in helping
you grasp your potion. From then on, you no longer hear sounds and
see visions that you shouldn’t. Dunn said that it was similar to what I
did.
“Heh heh, are you not going to seal the room? I personally do not
mind your brother and sister misunderstanding…” the translucent
face said at an adequate pace.
So that’s the reason… She’s indeed Madam Daly… Klein heaved a
sigh of relief, pushing the Holy Night Powder back into the inner
pocket. He then walked to the desk and took out the silver dagger he
used for rituals from the drawer.
He quickly built up a wall of spirituality before turning to the
protruding face.
“Madam Daly, what else did the Captain talk about in the letter?”
“He only expressed his own confusion and said that he seemed to
understand something — yet, he couldn’t describe it clearly. He
hoped to get my opinion on the matter,” Daly said with the help of
the face without eyes. “And when I read the letter this morning, I
knew that you aren’t as clueless as you pretend to be. Heh heh, Mr.
Moretti, I think that you have deduced the ‘acting method!'”
“That’s the reason you came looking for me?” Klein neither
conﬁrmed nor denied her statement.
Daly clearly knows about the “acting method”… He calmly made the
judgment.
Daly’s translucent face revealed a slight smile.
“Yes.”
“I believe that we should be honest with each other. I know that you
have deduced the acting method, and you also know that I grasp the
‘acting method’ as well. Sigh. But what’s making me unhappy is that I
used nearly two years to understand it — yet, you’ve only been a
Beyonder for one and a half months.”
Klein fell silent for a while after hearing Daly. He then smiled
honestly.
“That’s because I have you as my role model.”
He wanted to say that he was “standing on the shoulders of giants,”
but ultimately decided not to give the Emperor Roselle a chance to
appear in the conversation.
Chapter 148: Messenger
Klein’s reply made Daly chuckle. The translucent face with only a
mouth said, “Even though you found inspiration through the maxim
of the Mystery Pryers and conﬁrmed your theories through my
experience and performance, it only took you a month to understand
the ‘acting method’ and come up with your own Seer principle. That
shows that you possess outstanding wisdom and an open mind.”
Klein didn’t engage in the topic which made him guilty, but instead
asked in response, “Madam, do the higher-ups in the church know
about this so-called ‘acting method?'”
“No doubt, they understand it very clearly. I once read through the
historical information in the church and searched through stories of
people ignoring the norms and advancing quickly. I realized that
there were more than a few Nighthawks and bishops who have done
so, I’m not the most unique one either. But their ending…” Daly
intentionally paused, and she suddenly sounded heavy-hearted.
“What kind of ending did they have?” Klein asked, feeling a tug at his
heartstrings.
Could it be that the Church of the Evernight Goddess views the “acting
method” as the seduction of some devil or evil god?
The translucent face suddenly laughed. “Their endings were rather
great. Besides the few who lost control or were sacriﬁced in Beyonder
incidents, the rest of them have at least become archbishops or high-
ranking deacons. Among them, there are also experts that have
successfully become High-Sequence Beyonders. In the Church of the
Goddess, Sequence 4’s and Sequence 3’s are called Saints, while
Sequence 2’s and Sequence 1’s are called Grounded Angels. Of
course, every angel was once a Saint.”
… Madam Daly, you deliberately tried to scare me earlier… the corner
of Klein’s lips twitched before he asked, without hiding his
suspicions, “Since the Church has mastered the ‘acting method,’ why
didn’t they just tell every Nighthawk? Although it wouldn’t prevent
every Nighthawk from losing control, it would deﬁnitely lower the
probability and reduce unnecessary losses.”
A sense of loss appeared on the translucent face. “I have no idea why
either. They told me that when I become an archbishop or high-
ranking deacon, I’ll be able to know the secret. I came here today
because I hope that you can tell Dunn about the ‘acting method’ more
clearly before you hand in your special request.”
Klein wasn’t stupid enough to ask why she couldn’t do that herself;
instead, he said thoughtfully, “Once noticed by the Church, one has
to swear not to tell anyone about the ‘acting method?'”
“Yes, you must do it before the Goddess’s holy items and swear upon
Her name. That holds enough binding force. Trust me, you deﬁnitely
don’t want to know the outcome of a violation. I can only talk about
it with people who have mastered the ‘acting method,’ like you. Your
body language already gave me the answer before you replied; that’s
why I dared to say the term.” Daly made the creepy face sigh.
She paused for a moment before saying, “I only faintly grasped the
essence of ‘acting’ back then and digested the potion very quickly.
Yes, among the higher-ups in the Church, using the term ‘digesting’
to describe the control of the potion is very aptly worded. Anyway,
before I made the pledge and found out about the ‘acting method,’ I
had no clear understanding of it, so I couldn’t accurately explain it to
Dunn and the others.
“I gave up at ﬁrst. I never thought that I would meet you, an
eccentric wonder that could clearly understand the ‘acting method’
before handing in a special application—no, a genius.”
So that’s how you see me, Madam… the corner of Klein’s mouth
twitched before he solemnly promised, “I originally intended to
remind Captain about the existence of the ‘acting method’ through
my special application. With your explanation, I don’t have to worry
further.”
“Very well, you’re such a kind lad.” Daly sounded relaxed.
Madam, you’re only about two to three years older than me… Klein
inwardly pointed out the error in her words.
Without him speaking any further, the translucent creepy face
continued, “If you have any problems or anything that you require
assistance with, you can write a letter to me. Wait for me, heh heh.
When I become an Archbishop or a high-ranking deacon which
allows me to understand why the Church hides the ‘acting method,’
I’ll give you a hint whether if it’s a good or bad thing.
Klein was suddenly energized, and he asked without hesitation,
“Madam, what’s your address?”
To him, the more help he got, the merrier. Plus, she was a pretty
strong Spirit Medium!
Seeing that Klein didn’t oppose the idea at all, Daly remained silent
for a while before she laughed.
“Our communication shouldn’t go through the post oﬃce, as we
would be using normal letters. That’s very dangerous.
“I’ll teach you a relatively easy ritualistic magic. You can use it to
summon a special spirit, one that belongs to me. Pass the letter to it,
and it’ll send it precisely to me. It wouldn’t be faster than a telegram,
but it’s faster than a steam locomotive. If you were to send a message
at noon, I would receive the message in Backlund that same night.”
Klein listened to her with his full attention. He nodded faintly. “A
very pragmatic ritualistic magic.”
Daly chuckled.
“The uniqueness of the ritualistic magic is to pray to yourself.
Obtaining power from your own spirituality, without going through a
god. Hence, it’s quite secretive, but it isn’t very powerful.
“… First, you select a herb and essential oil in the corresponding
domain. This is no diﬀerent than normal ritualistic magic. However,
you only need the candle that represents yourself. Then, regarding
the spell, there are three parts. The ﬁrst part is ‘I.’ Shout ‘I’ in either
ancient Hermes, Jotun, Dragonish, or Elvish. The second part is ‘I
summon in my name.’ That part can be said in Hermes. The third
part is the exact description of the summoning object. For instance,
you would use this in the future: ‘the spirit that wanders about the
unfounded, the higher-dimensional creature that a human orders, the
messenger that belongs to Daly Simone.”
Higher-dimensional? In mysticism, this is normally referred to as the spirit
world…Klein memorized as he analyzed the ritual procedure.
In that aspect, he could barely be considered an expert.
The beneﬁt of this kind of ritualistic magic is that it avoids calling upon a
god but relies purely on a person’s power. It achieves various magical
eﬀects without the constraints imposed by a god’s specialized domain. The
problem lies in the strength of a person. A weak result for the weak, and a
strong result for the strong… Klein felt that he had once again obtained
new mysticism knowledge that he would’ve never come into contact
with at his current Sequence.
Daly repeated the description a few times and emphasized solemnly,
“Remember, don’t change the actual description of the summoning
object, or the ritual could easily attract a terrifying monster.”
“Okay.” Klein nodded honestly.
At the same time, he suddenly thought of something.
If I were to change the description of the summoning object to “The Fool
that doesn’t belong to this era, the mysterious ruler above the gray fog; the
King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck,” what would be
summoned?
Would it be utterly useless, or would the gray fog suddenly descend, or
would I need to respond in that mysterious space?
Would this help me in stirring more power from the world above the gray
fog?
Would it cause a terrifying chain eﬀect?
Klein still felt traces of the fear after his experimentation with the
Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem. In the end, he followed his intent and
planned to divine above the gray fog before deciding whether he
should make the attempt or not.
He contemplated and asked out of interest, “Madam, if one were to
strictly practice the ‘acting method,’ how long does it take to go from
Sequence 8 to Sequence 7, and how long from Sequence 7 to
Sequence 6?”
“According to the information that I’ve read, it varies from three
months to two years for Sequence 8 to Sequence 7. It depends on
whether you can grasp the core spirit and corresponding principle
during the ‘acting’ process. From Sequence 7 to Sequence 6, it varies
from half a year to three years; likewise for Sequence 6 to Sequence
5. As for Sequence 5 to Sequence 4, three to twenty years…” Daly
described roughly.
Klein suddenly smiled.
“So Madam, are you already at Sequence 6?”
He heard from Dunn that Daly used a year’s time from Sequence 9
Corpse Collector to Sequence 8 Gravedigger. Then, from Gravedigger
to Sequence 7 Spirit Medium, she used another year. She had been a
Beyonder for ﬁve years. In other words, Daly was at the Spirit
Medium stage for about three years.
“Yes, that’s the reason why I was transferred to Backlund diocese,”
the creepy translucent face answered frankly. “My current occupation
is a Spirit Guide. However, I prefer the name Spirit Medium. Alright,
this little guy is getting tired. I have to go. Under such circumstances,
I won’t be saying ‘may the Goddess bless you.'”
“Sweet dreams.” Klein pressed his chest, smiled, and bowed.
“No, there won’t be any sweet dreams tonight. I have to rush back to
Backlund. This isn’t a happy experience, it’s like having a relationship
with someone you don’t like…” Daly’s voice grew softer, and the
translucent face with no eyes or nose slowly shrank back into the
wall without leaving behind any traces.
The gas lamp light suddenly became bright and the gloominess
vanished into thin air.
Klein, who had his Spirit Vision activated the entire time, watched
the changes in a daze. It took him a while to snap back to reality.
“Spirit Medium—no, Spirit Guide is very impressive. It can actually
conjure a ‘messenger.’ I wonder what’s the specialty of my Sequence
7 and Sequence 6?” he muttered to himself. Then, he quickly
dispelled the spiritual wall, switched oﬀ the gas lamp in his bedroom,
and silently lay down in the darkness.
He didn’t plan to head to the world above the gray fog that night,
just in case Daly suddenly returned and said Dunn Smith’s classic
words, “Oh yeah, I forgot one thing.”
When that happens, I wouldn’t even be able to silence her with death!
…
On the second day, Klein arrived at the Blackthorn Security Company
three minutes early.
“Good morning, Klein. The new clerk is here!” Rozanne greeted with
a splendid smile.
Klein felt sincerely happy for her.
“Congratulations, Rozanne. The Goddess heard your prayers.”
“My skin shall be back to perfect condition!” Rozanne nodded, her
eyes beaming with joy.
After they chatted for a while, Klein walked through the partition and
knocked on the door to the Captain’s oﬃce.
“Please come in.” Dunn’s mellow voice sounded.
Klein pushed open the door to enter. He saw his Captain sit up
instinctively as his gray eyes turned dark. It was as though he was
prepared for trouble.
Ahem. Klein cleared his throat, set aside his hat and cane, then sat
down. “Captain, I have something that I’d like to report.”
“What is it?” Dunn asked in a deep voice, his arms crossed.
Chapter 149: Direct Hint
Klein looked at the serious Dunn Smith and smiled suddenly.
“Captain, I understood something yesterday.”
“And what is that?” Dunn repeated the question in a serious tone. He
leaned back and unfolded his crossed arms.
Klein recalled the script that he had prepared.
“As I was concluding my past experiences, I realized that the names
of Sequence potions encompass a whole set of principles that can
help us gain control over them, a set of principles that allow us to
avoid the negative impacts. When we’re doing things according to
these set of principles, we seem to become a member of the
corresponding job.
“Similarly, these sets of principles are hidden. They aren’t made
known to you directly. All we can do is make conclusions from the
corresponding job bit by bit, then adjust our understanding based on
the diﬀerent feedback we receive.
“Thus, when I became a real Seer at the Divination Club and obtained
my set of principles for the Seer, the auditory and visual illusions that
plagued me just vanished.
“That is what I understood.”
After ﬁnishing his narration, Klein heaved a sigh to himself. He said
everything he needed to say, other than explicitly mentioning the
term ‘acting.’
Sigh, let’s hope that the Captain doesn’t tell the Church that I’ve already
developed such ideas when he is asked. That would place much more
attention on me… There’s also the factor of the relationship between the
Seer pathway and the Antigonus family. That might cause trouble
eventually. But the Captain has also experienced all kinds of situations,
and he’s an experienced and smart person. Once he understands the
“acting method,” he’ll deﬁnitely notice that the Church is hiding relevant
information. He’ll know what he should say and what he shouldn’t…
Klein had many complicated thoughts.
But he quickly made a decision and had a plan.
If the Captain was still unable to understand the “acting method” or sense
of the cover-up by the Church, then I’ll tell him straight up before
submitting the special application!
Yes, I’ll probe him ﬁrst and determine what he knows…
Dunn listened to Klein’s description in silence, his gray eyes
becoming even deeper.
He was silent for nearly twenty seconds as he rubbed his temples
before he picked up his pipe and took a whiﬀ.
After sniﬃng it, he took out a matchbox, seemingly forgetting about
the rules of the Nighthawks.
The white smoke billowed into the air as Dunn closed his eyes,
seemingly appreciating the smell of tobacco.
After a while, he opened his eyes and smiled at Klein.
“I’m sorry, I forgot that you don’t smoke.”
“Smoking is bad for your health,” Klein answered in all seriousness.
Dunn thought with his pipe in his hand.
“I seem to have understood something too.”
No Captain, you don’t understand anything! Just don’t loiter in my
dreams too often!Klein didn’t speak and instead, gave a friendly smile.
“Perhaps it won’t be too long before you submit the special
application to me…” Dunn said to Klein, half-jokingly as he took a
deep puﬀ of the mint and tobacco.
Can I submit it tomorrow? Klein replied inwardly. He took out his
pocket watch and looked at the time.
“Captain, I have be at Old Neil’s. Today’s mysticism lessons are
starting soon.”
“Alright.” Dunn watched Klein leave, his pipe still in his hand.
After closing the door to the Captain’s oﬃce, Klein made his way
towards the steps leading to the basement in high spirits. He saw two
strangers, a male and a female, when he walked past the clerk’s
oﬃce.
The new clerks… Klein’s mind wondered before he added inwardly, In
another two days, deﬁnitely within this week, I’ll submit my application to
Captain!
Then I’ll pass a series of inspections and become a Sequence 8 Clown!
…
Along the silent underground passage, Klein turned to the armory
and pushed the guard room door open.
“What happened to you?” Klein had a shock when he saw Old Neil.
Old Neil looked dispirited, his face was pale. He yawned constantly
as he said, “I’ve been a little constipated lately. I tried ritualistic
magic that can solve such problems last night. In the end… I didn’t
sleep well the entire night. I had to head to the bathroom multiple
times, and in the end, and I nearly fell asleep on the toilet bowl.”
Well, the problem of constipation has been solved… Klein nearly
laughed, seeing that it wasn’t a serious problem.
But he controlled himself. He asked, “Are you feeling better now?”
At the same time, his concern made him tap his left molar twice. He
used his Spirit Vision to observe the aura of Old Neil’s health.
There are some darkness and impurities in the digestive system’s yellow
and the kidney’s orange colors, but it’s nothing too serious and is within
an acceptable range… Klein heaved a sigh of relief.
“I’m ﬁne now. I got some medicine for the diarrhea from Frye.” Old
Neil yawned like a drug addict. “Self-study for today’s supernatural
lesson. There’s only two or three days left of content anyway.”
“Alright,” Klein responded politely. “I could help you guard the
armory and study here. How about you go rest in the break room?”
Old Neil immediately straightened his back, his eyes glimmering as
he answered, “Lad, you surely are the kindest Nighthawk, second to
Frye!
“I’ll hand the armory over to you!”
He picked up the cushion he had placed on his knees and rushed out
of the guard room like a typhoon, leaving Klein the only person
there, dazed.
…
The Blackthorn Security Company accepted an extra mission in the
morning. The task involved escorting a rich merchant to the harbor
for a deal. Leonard and Kenley completed it easily, earning
themselves some extra pay, much to the envy of Klein.
He went about his day, learning about mysticism, practicing his
shooting, and getting tortured by Instructor Gawain who seemed to
have been agitated by something.
Huﬀ, huﬀ… Klein gasped for air. He only regained the ability to take
a shower and change after quite some time.
He continued toiling after leaving Gawain’s house. He spent two soli
on a carriage and investigated the other ten houses with red
chimneys.
Klein’s expression became very grave when the last house with the
red chimney left his ﬁeld of vision.
The house with the red chimney that I saw in my divination isn’t in the list
of houses with a recent change in tenants… If that’s the case, this has just
become troublesome. I wonder how much time I would need to investigate
about 1600 houses… Sigh. I can’t ask for any help to do something like
this. After all, only I would have the sense of familiarity from my
spirituality when I see the target…
Don’t be discouraged, don’t give up. I’ll continue the investigation
whenever I have free time. I’ll try to complete it within three months, no—
two months! Who knows, the target might be found in tomorrow’s
investigation!
And, I’ll organize the material when I get back and plan a route according
to the distance of the sectors!
Klein motivated himself, banishing his feelings of depression.
Now that he had made a decision, he planned to instruct the driver to
turn toward Daﬀodil Street. However, he suddenly realized that he
was somewhere close to where Mr. Azik stayed.
Before Mr. Azik went for his holiday, he did write to tell me that he would
be back sometime this week, but he didn’t specify the exact date. Since it’s
on the way, I’ll leave a note for him. Also, I rented this carriage for an
hour with two soli, and the time’s almost up anyway. I’ll just stop at Mr.
Azik’s house, then take a public carriage back… Klein quickly made a
decision.
Four minutes later, he alighted from the carriage and arrived outside
Mr. Azik’s house.
The houses here were obviously of higher quality than those at
Daﬀodil Street, but not as good as those on Howes Street. There was
a patch of grass in front of the house, and a small garden in the back.
Ding! Ding! Ding!
Klein pulled on the rope outside the door and sounded the bell within
the house.
A few moments later, he heard footsteps from inside before the door
swung open.
Azik’s mild facial features and bronze skin appeared before Klein.
Since he was at home, he was only dressed in a simple white shirt, a
brown vest, and matching pants.
“Klein? I was just about to write to you,” Azik greeted
enthusiastically. “I just arrived home last night.”
Klein stared at the small mole near Azik’s right ear.
“Mr. Azik, I found a clue to your past.”
“Really?” Azik instantly became excited. The sadness he had in his
eyes dulled.
“Let’s talk inside.” Klein looked around.
Azik quickly nodded. He moved to the side and allowed Klein entry.
He locked the door and guided Klein to the living room on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor. They sat on the soft sofa.
“What clues did you ﬁnd?” he asked impatiently.
Having not expected to meet Mr. Azik today, Klein organized his
words.
“I received a mission recently and had to deal with a wraith in
Lamud Town.”
“Lamud…” Azik repeated the term softly, his eyebrows creasing.
Klein observed his expression and slowed down his tone.
“In the process of dealing with the wraith, we discovered something
and thus conducted an investigation within the town…
“A resident of the town was in possession of a portrait of the ﬁrst
Baron Lamud which he tried to sell me. I asked to view the portrait
out of curiosity and discovered that the person drawn had facial
features that resembled yours, other than the hair. He even had the
same mole near the ear, similar position, similar size.
“Under my interrogation, the man told me that the portrait was about
forty years old, but the person in the portrait deﬁnitely came from
the abandoned castle. It was a replica of the ancient portrait
excavated from the castle.
“You should know that people like us with unique abilities can more
or less tell if somebody is lying. This told me that the man wasn’t
lying.”
Azik leaned forward as he listened to Klein. He crossed his arms and
remained silent for a while.
Five minutes later, he exhaled.
“Your description didn’t make me recall anything. Perhaps, I should
visit the abandoned castle myself. Can you take me there?”
“That would be my honor,” Klein replied. “But I have to head home
ﬁrst. I don’t want my siblings to worry.”
“No problem.” Azik stood up.
Chapter 150: Azik's Discovery
2 Daﬀodil Street. Klein nodded at Azik and briskly walked to the door
of his house, ﬁshed out his keys, and opened the door.
Melissa was already home, so she heard the click of the door lock and
quickly came out of the kitchen and into the living room.
Upon seeing Klein, she said with eyes beaming with joy, “I bought
groceries. There’s chicken, potatoes, onions, ﬁsh, turnips, and peas. I
even bought a small jar of honey.”
Sis, are you also getting used to the occasional luxury? Klein
chuckled.
“You’ll have to prepare dinner tonight. Count me out for I’ll be out of
town. I might not return until dawn. Yea, I’m doing a favor for Mr.
Azik, a teacher from the Khoy University’s Department of History.”
As he spoke, he turned sideways and pointed at the carriage that was
waiting outside.
Melissa’s lips opened and closed twice, before she pursed them and
said, “Alright.”
Klein bade his sister farewell and left. He got into the rented carriage
that Azik had hired and traveled two hours and forty minutes to
Lamud Town.
It was almost nine at that point. The sky was dark, and they could
only rely on the crimson moonlight and the twinkling starlight that
penetrated the clouds to illuminate the areas without street lamps.
After he instructed the driver to wait in town, Klein led Azik towards
the ancient abandoned castle.
As they walked, he realized that Azik was walking faster, to the point
of him having to break out into a small jog to keep up. In the end, it
was Azik who led the way.
Klein wanted to say something initially, but cleverly swallowed his
words when he saw Azik’s solemn expression and tightly pursed lips.
With such speed, they quickly arrived at the ancient castle.
The castle which was almost a wreckage extended itself in all four
directions while its spire looked desolate, wild, eerie, and dark.
Azik looked at the ancient castle and slowed down his footsteps.
He stopped there and his gaze looked profound but lost, as though he
was hovering between dreams and reality.
Suddenly, he groaned in pain, lifting his hand to pinch his forehead
while his muscles looked distorted with agony.
“Mr. Azik, are you okay?” Klein asked carefully as he activated his
Spirit Vision.
When they were onboard the hired carriage, making their way from
Daﬀodil Street to Lamud Town, he had done a quick divination by
ﬂipping a coin to see if there would be any danger on their trip.
But he believed that divination wasn’t all-powerful, and he kept his
guard up to prevent any misinterpretation on his part. Plus, Azik was
quite mysterious. No one knew about his past, and it was uncertain
how he would respond if he were to be stimulated by an encounter
with his past. Caution and worry had accompanied Klein throughout
the trip.
Azik didn’t reply immediately but took another two steps forward
with a pained expression. He relaxed the hand that was holding his
forehead. He then pointed forward with a dreamy tone.
“I’ve seen this ancient castle before in my dream.
“Back then, it was still complete with a robust outer wall and a high
spire.
“I remember that there was a stable there, a water well there, and a
barracks there. Over there was a garden that was used to plant
potatoes and sweet potatoes…
“I remember there was a training ﬁeld. My child, he was a boy. He
was only about seven or eight years old, but he enjoyed running
around while dragging a broadsword that was taller than him. He
said that he wanted to become a knight when he grows up…
“My wife always complained about it being too gloomy in the castle.
She liked the sunlight, the warmth…”
…
Klein looked at the color of his energy ﬁeld, and what the man said
made his scalp tingle. He was also slightly touched, as though he was
experiencing a paranormal story himself.
The ancient castle is really related to Mr. Azik… Could he really be
the ﬁrst generation Baron Lamud, a transcendental creature that has
lived for fourteen hundred years? Is he a human or an evil spirit? No
way, there are no such things as evil spirits running around under
broad daylight and getting involved with the Nighthawks… Klein
couldn’t help with his thoughts and allowed them to clash against
each other to ignite more ideas.
Just then, Azik stopped muttering and took huge strides through the
main gate.
He walked all the way into the castle without Klein’s guidance. He
found the hidden gear with obvious familiarity and opened the secret
door to enter the basement.
Gripping his cane tightly, Klein followed behind Azik. They walked
down along the stairs and returned to the place where there was a
coﬃn.
Unlike the previous time, the coﬃn was closed and the warm and
pure feeling was gone.
The coﬃn is closed… It must’ve been Frye. It’s his work ethic as a
Corpse Collector…Klein nodded thoughtfully and watched the
conﬂicted Azik walk in front of the coﬃn with his Spirit Vision.
Azik extended his hands to push the coﬃn lid until there was a gap.
He gazed at the skeleton without a skull for a long time, and he
suddenly wailed in pain and sorrow.
Azik lurched backwards with heavy footsteps. He staggered and fell
against the wall before Klein managed to respond.
He covered his face with his hands and sat there dispirited. The
surroundings suddenly became even darker.
Klein quickened his pace and extended his hands, but he retracted
them again, not daring to disturb the man.
Just then, his spiritual perception told him that the current Mr. Azik
was very scary, so scary that the basement grew gloomy and
terrifying.
Klein slowly moved closer to the stairs.
He trusted Mr. Azik’s character, but he was afraid that the man
would lose control.
In such an uneasy situation, he waited for a few more minutes. Then,
he ﬁnally saw Azik lower his hands and stand up slowly.
Mr. Azik seems to have changed… This is what my spiritual
perception tell me… But in my Spirit Vision, his aura colors don’t
have any obvious changes. His emotions are in low spirits, depressed
and pained as before… Klein made a quick judgment and felt that
Azik had become gloomier and more imposing.
“I recalled something, but it’s very minor.” Azik spoke with an
emotionless tone.
Then, he looked around and said,
“I sense the power that made your fate disharmonious.”
“Huh?” Klein was stunned. Pleasantly surprised, he asked in reply,
“Can you trace the source?”
The person behind the scene who stayed in the red chimney house
created coincidences in secret and came to Lamud’s ancient castle to
take away the black armored knight’s head?
What is he trying to do? What is his true intention?
“It’s been too long, but, I’d like to try.” There seemed to be a volcano
that was close to erupting within Azik’s deep voice.
“How?” Klein asked curiously.
Azik walked before the coﬃn and gazed upon the skeleton inside it.
“He took my child’s skull. I want to ﬁnd him through a blood
connection.”
Your child? Mr. Azik, are you sure the black armored knight is your
child? So you really are an antique… You really lost your memory
after such a long time? This is the price you have to pay in order to
obtain such longevity? Klein took a silent breath, feeling the odd
sensation of interacting with a legendary creature.
Then, Azik extended his right hand and suddenly cut his index ﬁnger
with his thumbnail.
A drop of fresh red blood accurately dripped onto the white skeleton.
It quickly seeped into the skeleton, and the entire skeleton suddenly
turned blood-red.
Wah! Wah! Wah! Klein suddenly heard the sound of a baby crying
and felt that there was someone staring at him from behind.
He drew his revolver and pointed behind him before turning around
slowly. However, there was nothing in sight. Nothing existed behind
him.
Even the stairway that connected to the ground ﬂoor was gone!
Wah! Wah!
The sound of a baby crying drilled into Klein’s ears, and when he
looked towards the coﬃn again, he was shocked to see that there
were many shapeless and distorted faces rising amidst billowing
black fog. Then, they manifested a strange door.
Creak!
The illusory door opened and palish-white arms extended out, one
after another, but they vanished into the black fog before Azik.
Through the crack that the door opened, Klein saw a white skull. It
was thrown underneath a brown tree and reduced to powder as a
result of the elements.
Creak!
Countless palish-white arms were sliced oﬀ by the door that suddenly
slammed shut as they fell onto the ground.
Then, Klein heard a long sigh, Mr. Azik’s heavy sigh, a sigh that
seemed to have a rich history behind it.
Along with the sigh, the black fog dispersed and the sound of a baby
crying ceased. Everything returned to its original state, except for the
accentuated chill.
Klein clenched his chattering teeth and looked into the coﬃn. He saw
that the red skeleton had returned to its original, crystal-clear white.
“I’m sorry. I couldn’t ﬁnd him…” Azik said in a deep voice, his back
to Klein.
At the same time, he closed the coﬃn.
“It’s not surprising that we couldn’t ﬁnd him. It would’ve been a
surprise if we could,” Klein comforted him.
Anyway, I’ve been disappointed many times regarding this matter…
he added in his head.
Azik took another glance at the coﬃn before him. He turned around
slowly and said, “I’ll continue investigating and I hope that I can
have your assistance.”
“No problem. This is exactly what I wanted to do.” Klein held back
his urge to tell Azik about the red chimney.
Because it was useless to bring it up. He could only rely on himself to
conﬁrm his target.
However, that solved one of his major problems, which was how he
should involve the Nighthawks after he found the red chimney house.
He didn’t believe that he could take out such a mysterious and scary
puppet master alone.
Now, he could ask for Mr. Azik’s help!
Azik widened his mouth, but didn’t say anything in the end. All he
did was sigh and walk towards the stairway quietly.
After leaving the basement and closing the secret door, the two of
them walked along the road covered with weeds and brambles.
Neither one of them spoke as they walked back from the abandoned
ancient castle.
In the dark night, Azik suddenly said,
“Until this matter is resolved, I will quit my job and leave Tingen, to
look for my lost past.”
“Mr. Azik, did you ﬁnd out what happened to you?” Klein asked,
having failed to hide his curiosity.
Chapter 151: Klein's Request
The chirping of insects and the hooting of owls reverberated along
the path back to the small town. Azik looked ahead and said after a
few seconds of silence, “Even though I’m not entirely sure what
happened to me, I do have a rough idea.
“Perhaps—perhaps I’m someone who has lived for a very, very long
time.”
Mr. Azik, you have to seriously consider if you still ﬁt the deﬁnition
of “someone”…Klein thought to himself, but he didn’t dare to say it
out loud.
“This wilderness, this silence, often makes one weak…
“I should’ve paid some sort of price in exchange for this long life. I’ve
lived since the end of the Fourth Epoch, like a wandering spirit across
the continent…” Azik’s voice deepened, as if he was trying to
suppress his emotions. “I don’t remember the past. I’ve forgotten
about the people and things that I’ve sworn to remember…”
Klein poked at the weeds in front of him and said, in thought, “Mr.
Azik, I have a theory regarding your situation.”
“What theory?” Azik looked to the side.
“I think that there’s a cycle to your memory loss. Perhaps you ‘die’
once every few decades, and your memories of the events before that
vanishes. Then, after some time, you wake up from the darkness of
your slumber and begin on a new phase of life. This way, we can
explain why you would have such varied dreams. Those are events
that you came across over your several lives,” Klein described his
theory.
Azik slowed down his pace, as if the darkness had grabbed onto his
sleeve. He looked ahead with a turbid look before saying after a
while, “That is consistent with the memories that were jolted awake
just now.”
Memories that were jolted awake? Klein had an idea as he said
immediately, “Mr. Azik, you might not have to leave Tingen to search
for your lost past. You’ll regain your memories slowly!”
“Why?” Azik turned his head in surprise.
Klein smiled and said, “Your memories aren’t completely gone. The
parts of your memory that jolted awake just now are proof of that.
“Furthermore, do you remember the moment you woke up in
Backlund and discovered that you had forgotten all about the past?”
Azik nodded. “That’s a nightmare that bothers me till this day.”
Klein tapped downwards with his black cane and explained in detail,
“Before today, I didn’t think that there was a problem with that. But
your description just now, together with my own conjecture, makes it
feel a little weird. You had a document of identiﬁcation and enough
money when you woke up from your dream. You also appeared in a
way that didn’t startle anyone… All of that seems like it was
arranged for you, allowing you to ﬁt into society with little eﬀort.
“Then, who made the arrangements?
“There is only one answer; the you from the past!
“The past you regained his memories and knew that you would have
to usher in a new life. Thus, he prepared everything for you, trying
his best to not let you attract suspicion from anyone else.”
Azik stopped walking. He looked at the specks of light coming from
the town, once again slipped into silence.
“Perhaps the ‘parents’ that I’ve been searching for were the past me
all along…” He sighed, admitting that Klein’s deduction was very
plausible.
“Thus, you don’t need to do anything. All you have to do is patiently
wait for your memories to come back to you,” Klein concluded and
consoled Mr. Azik.
Azik subconsciously waved his cane before he turned still, like a
sculpture carved out of marble.
After a long time, he looked into the distance and answered, “Perhaps
—perhaps I’ll only fully regain my memory when this life is nearing
its end. I don’t want to wait that long. I want to have plenty of time
to understand and free myself from this destiny. So I have to be more
proactive in searching for my past, to trigger my memories a little at
a time. I have to get back my memories back before the time you
hypothesized. Waiting would only make me repeat the cycle.”
“Indeed that’s the choice worth looking forward to the most.” Klein
didn’t advise against it. Instead, he asked, “Mr. Azik, may I ask for
your help in something trivial, other than ﬁnding the criminal that
took the skull of your child and made my fate disharmonious?”
Azik nodded slightly.
“What do you need me to do?”
Klein organized his words and said, “I hope that you can head to a
town between two and ﬁve hours away from Tingen by carriage next
week, or the week after. I need you to cause a paranormal incident,
something that wouldn’t harm anyone. Judging from how you tried
to search for the criminal using your bloodline’s connection, I would
think that you are fairly adept in the ﬁeld of dead souls.”
“No problem,” Azik promised without any hesitation. He didn’t ask
Klein why he wanted him to do something like that.
At the same time, he had tacitly conﬁrmed Klein’s conjecture about
his powers.
“Thank you. This is very important to me. Also, you can only choose
a follower of the Evernight Goddess when you are picking a target.
Also, don’t leave any clues behind,” Klein instructed.
Only through this method could the incident be relayed to the Tingen
Nighthawks. Only then could he join the team on the mission and
suggest using Sealed Artifact 3-0782. Only then could he extract the
divine blood from the Sealed Artifact to create Flaring Sun Charms!
That was the most powerful item he could obtain at the moment.
Under the assumption that the culprit living in the house with the red
chimney hasn’t left Tingen, and that Klein was going to continue
investigating, he had to try his best to become more powerful!
Yes, according to the information I obtained, stealing a little of its
powers wouldn’t damage 3-0782. At the very most, it would only
lessen the amount of time it takes to purify… This is for the safety
and stability of Tingen City! Klein inwardly tried to justify his
actions.
Azik didn’t care about his motives. He nodded.
“I will tell you the name of the town and the estimated time
beforehand so you can prepare yourself.”
Phew… Klein heaved a sigh of relief. He felt that this trip to Lamud
Town wasn’t a wasted trip.
Even though they only managed to peel back the outermost layer of
the mysteries surrounding Mr. Azik and had much more to ﬁnd out,
he had at least managed to gain the friendship of Azik, a reliable ally
in his search for the culprit behind the scenes!
…
At half past eleven that night, Klein returned to 2 Daﬀodil Street,
hungry and tired.
“To think that Mr. Azik didn’t treat me to dinner… Sigh. He wouldn’t
have been in the mood to enjoy dinner anyway,” Klein muttered as
he opened the door.
The house wasn’t as dark as he had anticipated. An elegant gas lamp
was silently emitting its light, warmly illuminating the living room.
Benson was sitting alone on the sofa with a book, draped under a
bright “coat.”
When he saw the door open, Benson was just about to speak when he
yawned. He had no choice but to cover his mouth.
Klein closed the door and smiled, quipping, “I went to Lamud Town
with Mr. Azik. There’s an abandoned castle with a long history over
there.”
Benson was immediately enlightened as he laughed.
“A moonless night, a castle abandoned for a millennia, a cold and
creepy environment, coupled with a two-man archaeological team…
This is the perfect recipe for the opening of a paranormal novel.”
What happened today could be classiﬁed as paranormal… Klein
suddenly recalled the strange door Mr. Azik conjured and the cries of
a baby. He said, a lingering fear still gripping onto him, “It did feel a
bit like that back there.”
Benson yawned again before shutting his book and said, “I need
sleep. Ever since I began studying and reading classical literature, the
quality of my sleep has become especially good.”
Klein laughed to himself, suddenly recalling something Miss Justice
had mentioned. He said, lowering his voice, “Benson, you know that
my company has connections with the Awwa County Police. I
recently heard news from Backlund that the King, Prime Minister,
other ministers and Members of Parliament are all sick of an
ineﬃcient government. They want to push for a reform and select
talents to take on positions in the government based on an open
examination, just like the entrance examinations of universities.”
Benson was at a loss at ﬁrst, then his eyes sparkled as he asked, “An
open examination?”
“Yes. As long as you pass the examination, you could become a civil
servant in one of the branches of the government. My guess, yes—my
guess is that the contents of the examination will be modeled after
the entrance exams of the universities: literature, the classics, math
and logic, as well as a basic understanding of the law…” Klein used
this opportunity to include his opinion. He continued, “Benson, this
must be kept conﬁdential, and don’t put too much hope on this. No
one knows if this will be passed by the House of Lords and House of
Commons or not.”
“I’ll keep it in mind. I understand that all I need to do is study hard.”
Benson smiled, then said, “I’d study hard whether this change
happens or not. I’ll try my best to free myself from my current
circumstance and ﬁnd a better job. Learning—that’s the greatest
diﬀerence between a human and a curly-haired baboon.”
No, research suggests that baboons have decent IQ levels, and a
certain level of learning abilities… Klein lampooned silently and
looked on as Benson headed to the second ﬂoor.
After that, he smiled and rubbed his stomach as he walked toward
the kitchen.
He found the leftovers and the chicken Benson and Melissa left him
especially. Klein relaxed as he started preparing his late dinner.
It was deep into the night now, and most people had already gone to
bed. He was the only one still awake, breathing in the cool air with
mixed aromas and making slight movements.
Everything was peaceful and serene.
…
After he was satiated, he washed the dishes and took a bath. Finally,
Klein returned to his room and locked the door.
He yawned but kept himself awake. He took out the silver dagger
used for rituals and sealed the room with a wall of spirituality.
He wanted to divine above the gray fog whether summoning “The
Fool that doesn’t belong to this era” was dangerous or not!
Chapter 152: Nice Attempt
The gray fog ﬁlled the air in its eternally unchanging manner as the
illusory crimson stars hung around him at varying distances. Klein sat
inside the lofty palace that looked like the home of a giant as he
looked at the familiar sight before him.
After a few seconds, he looked away and made a yellowish-brown
goatskin appear before him. Then, he lifted a pen to write his
amended incantation for the summoning ritual.
“Light a candle to represent myself.
“Use a spiritual wall to create a holy environment.
“Drip a drop of Full Moon Essence Oil in the ﬂame, Chamomile Pure
Dew, Slumber Flower Powder, and other ingredients. (Note: There’s
no need to be too particular in this step because it’s summoning
oneself).
“Recite the incantation below.
“I! (In ancient Hermes, Jotun, Dragonese, or Elﬁsh. It must be a deep
shout)
“I summon in my name (Hermes),
“The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era, the mysterious ruler above
the gray fog; the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.”
…
After scrutinizing it three times, Klein wrote a divination statement at
the bottom:
“There will be danger if the ritual above is carried out outside of this
world.”
Phew. He let out a breath, put down the pen, took out the silver
chain in his sleeve, and held it with his left hand.
The topaz pendant hung above the goatskin steadily, only a slight
distance above the divination statement. He reined in his thoughts
and entered a Cogitation state.
“There will be danger if the ritual above is carried out outside of this
world.
“There will be danger if the ritual above is carried out outside of this
world.”
…
After reciting the statement seven times, Klein opened his eyes which
were almost all black and looked at the topaz pendant which was
spinning counterclockwise.
That meant a negative outcome: there would be no danger!
“I can give it a try then.” Klein made the items before him disappear.
He then extended his spirituality to wrap around himself and
simulated the sensation of falling.
When he returned to his bedroom, due to the fact that he had sealed
the entire room with a spiritual wall, Klein immediately cleared his
desk and put out a mint-scented candle right in the middle.
He pressed slightly on the candle wick, rubbing it with spirituality to
cause friction and ignite the candle.
Under the ﬂickering dim light, Klein dripped the corresponding
essential oils, extracts, and herb powder onto the ﬂame.
A soothing fragrance suddenly ﬁlled the air, and the room alternated
between brightness and darkness.
Taking two steps back, Klein looked at the candle that represented
himself and shouted in Jotun, “I!”
Then, he switched to Hermes, “I summon in my name:
“The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era, the mysterious ruler above
the gray fog; the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.”
Just as he ﬁnished speaking, he sensed the wavering candlelight
suddenly dance vigorously and produce a vortex with the
surrounding fragrance. It absorbed his spirituality at an insane rate.
“Slumber ﬂower, a herb that belongs to the red moon, please bestow
your powers to my incantation…” Klein endured the discomfort
brought about from having his spirituality drained as he ﬁnished
reciting the incantation.
Then, he saw the candlelight stop wavering. It was tainted with a
gray luster, which extended to about the size of a palm.
“I didn’t summon anything… Oh right, perhaps I’ll need to respond to
it above the gray fog? It’s really quite troublesome to summon
myself…” Klein muttered, pinching his aching forehead.
He calmed himself down, then took four steps counterclockwise
before arriving above the gray fog again. He saw that there was a
rippling light above the seat of honor at the ancient table.
It stemmed from the strange symbol at the back of the corresponding
chair. The strange symbol that was made up of a Pupil-less Eye, a
symbol representing secrecy, and contorted lines that represented
change.
All Klein did was extend his hand to reach for it when he
immediately heard, “I! I summon in my name, The Fool that doesn’t
belong to this era, the mysterious ruler above the gray fog; the King
of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.” Then, he saw surging
spirituality combined with a rippling light that formed into an
illusory yet shapeless door.
The door shook as though it wanted to be opened. Klein immediately
felt inspired and strongly willed for it to be pushed open.
Almost instantly, the boundless fog and lofty palace was drawn
forward. There were a few barely noticeable ripples.
The ripples surged towards the illusory yet shapeless door.
But, no matter how much Klein pushed it, the door couldn’t be
pushed open. Every movement resulted in dead silence.
“The Door of Summoning has yet to take shape?” Klein reined in his
will and creased his eyebrows when he analyzed the reason why he
had failed.
He had casually named the door “the Door of Summoning.”
“Hmm, I’m lacking spirituality, so I can’t form a complete Door of
Summoning. When I advance to Sequence 8 Clown and pass through
the initial dangerous stage, I can give it another try. Maybe it won’t
be a problem by then…” Klein nodded lightly and roughly
understood what had happened.
This experiment gave him a conﬁdence boost, he felt heartened as
this was the ﬁrst time that he received some sort of response from the
mysterious space above the gray fog — other than the incident where
he divined about Eternal Blazing Sun!
There will come a day when I’ll understand all the secrets here! Klein
excitedly declared in his heart. He then made a rapid descent into the
boundless fog after he wrapped himself up with spirituality.
…
Klein quickly blew out the candle after he returned to his bedroom.
He ended the ritual and cleaned up his study desk before he removed
the spiritual wall.
A gust of wind suddenly blew as he yawned. He collapsed into the
bed, covered himself with a blanket and quickly fell asleep.
In the hazy dream that followed, Klein woke up abruptly and realized
that he was sitting in the living room of his home and was holding
the Tingen City Honest Paper.
… Don’t tell me Captain is here again? He was stunned at ﬁrst as he
looked outside the oriel window, ﬁnding humor in his exasperation.
With a creak, the door opened. Dunn walked in slowly, wearing his
black windbreaker that went beyond his knees and held a cane and
pipe.
He was still wearing his black top hat, and underneath it were his
profound gray eyes.
Dunn came to the living room and sat on the single seat sofa. He
leisurely crossed his right leg over his left.
He put aside his cane, took oﬀ his hat, and leaned backwards. He sat
there quietly and looked at Klein as though he was thinking.
Captain, what are you trying to do today… Klein was dumbfounded.
In order to not expose that he knew that it was a dream, he
pretended to not be aﬀected by it and continued to read the
newspaper.
One minute, two minutes, ﬁve minutes. He lifted his head to look at
Dunn who sat opposite him. He found out that the Captain was still
sitting there quietly and was looking at him in deep thought.
Five minutes, ten minutes, ﬁfteen minutes. Klein ﬂipped through the
newspaper back and forth multiple times, looking at Dunn from the
corner of his eyes, and noticed that the man was still looking at him
quietly in deep thought.
Captain, you’re making me very uncomfortable… Klein couldn’t sit in
peace. He folded the newspaper and put it aside. He nodded and
smiled at Dunn. Then, he went to the kitchen to get a piece of cloth
and started wiping the dining table and coﬀee table.
Captain, look, my dream is so simple, so ordinary, so boring. There’s
nothing worth observing. Hurry up and leave! Why don’t you pretend
to be a ghost and I’ll pretend to be frightened, then you can complete
your achievement as a Nightmare! He prayed in silence and lifted his
head, but all he saw was Dunn’s deep gray eyes that were still in deep
thought.
Under such a quiet and constant gaze, Klein wiped all the furniture
and cleaned his room. He was so exhausted in his dream.
What wore him out the most was Dunn Smith, who was watching
him quietly in deep thought.
Klein had no idea how much time had passed while he made himself
busy until he ﬁnally saw his Captain uncross his legs and stand up.
Then, he took his cane, put on his hat, and walked through the door.
Klein held his breath and watched Dunn leave his house.
He couldn’t help but lift his right hand to wave goodbye.
Phew… When everything returned to normal, Klein let out a breath
of relief.
That really was such a nightmare! He thought to himself, too
preoccupied for tears.
…
Backlund, West Backlund, Philip’s Department Store.
Philip’s was one of the top-end department stores in the Loen
Kingdom. It only opened to nobles and wealthy people who were
qualiﬁed to be members.
There was always luxurious carriages parked outside with diﬀerent
emblems printed on them. Not only was it a safe place for shopping,
it also became a popular social venue due to the strict restriction on
members.
Audrey brought her maidservant, Annie, and her golden retriever,
Susie. Under the ushering of an eagerly attentive attendant, she got
oﬀ the carriage and walked through the entrance.
Along the way, she saw daughters of viscounts, countesses, or
maidens with parents of high social status.
She maintained her elegance and greeted them all gracefully. She
communicated with diﬀerent nobles on diﬀerent topics. For instance,
when she faced a particular countess, she would compliment the
ﬁttings of the countess’s dress and when she greeted a particular
baroness, she would praise the outstanding performance of the
baroness’s husband in the House of Lords.
Audrey hadn’t been good at that previously; she was too stubborn
and too arrogant. But now, she didn’t even need to put in much eﬀort
to respond perfectly.
In a Spectator’s eyes, most of the emotions and thoughts of the
female nobles were written on their faces.
Arriving at the second ﬂoor, Audrey turned into a shop that sold
ready-made dresses.
The attendant in the shop was a petite maiden. She wore a black and
white dress and had shoulder-length blond hair. She was the Arbiter,
Xio Derecha.
Audrey gave Susie a look without changing her facial expression. The
dog understood what her owner meant immediately and ran to
another counter.
Maidservant Annie went after Susie to try to drag her back.
Well done! Audrey complimented inwardly and walked next to Xio
Derecha, pretending to look at the variety of dresses.
“… Why did you arrange to meet me here for?” Xio inquired with a
whisper while she loudly introduced the dresses.
Her voice was tender, just like a child’s.
“Where’s the original attendant?” Audrey asked in reply instead of
answering her.
Xio looked around and said, “I convinced her. She was happy to rest
for the morning.”
Audrey looked at the diﬀerent styled dresses while she took out a
piece of neatly folded paper from her lamb leather handbag and
secretly passed it to Xio.
“Rear Admiral Hurricane, Qilangos, has snuck into Backlund. This is
his portrait. I hope you can ﬁnd him for me. Oh, and don’t alert him.”
Xio received the piece of paper and unfolded it to take a quick
glance. She saw that it was a lifelike portrait of a man in his thirties
that had a unique broad chin.
I was once constantly praised by my art teacher… Audrey stole a
glance at Xio and lifted her head.
She added, “The Kingdom oﬀers a reward of ten thousand pounds for
Qilangos. If he were to be arrested, even the person that only
provided clues would deﬁnitely be awarded with a few hundred
pounds.”
Just as she ﬁnished her sentence, she saw Xio’s eyes beam with joy,
as she had expected.
Chapter 153: Final Act of Laying
the Foundation
A unique wide jaw, his hair is in a bun like an ancient knight’s, eyes
that look at you with the intent of an icy smile… Xio Derecha was
half slumped on the sofa as she scrutinized the portrait that Audrey
had handed to her.
In her eyes, the man might as well have been a living, walking pile of
money.
After committing the looks of the great pirate Qilangos to her
memory, she proceeded to read the description written at the bottom
of the page:
“Brown hair, dark green eyes.
“The portrait can only be used as a general reference as the target
possesses the ability to transform into another person. It is unknown
how long he can maintain the transformation.”
The portrait can only be used as a reference… The target possesses
the ability to transform into another person… Only as a reference,
transform into another person… Then why did I spend so much time
memorizing his facial features? Xio wore a dazed look, as if it was the
ﬁrst time she had witnessed the evil intentions the world had for her.
She looked up and saw Fors Wall slumped languidly in a sofa across
from her. She seemed to be muttering to herself, “There’s no way to
look for this person. We don’t know what he looks like. All we know
is that he’s not from Backlund. There are far too many foreigners who
come into Backlund every day.”
Fors attempted to sit up, but failed even after three tries.
“I’m only an Apprentice, not an Arbiter…” She pouted as she placed
her hand on the armrest of the sofa, successfully pulling herself up
into a sitting position.
“Does that lady think that we are prophets?” Fors jested.
Xio was about to answer when she realized that there were still
footnotes she hadn’t gone through yet.
She recited them out softly, “The suggested ways of searching are as
follows:
“1. Qilangos has an evil object with him. It needs to devour the ﬂesh,
blood, and soul of a living person every other day. You can consider
looking for missing vagrants.
“2. Search for Qilangos’s information thoroughly and build a proﬁle
of his unique hobbies and behaviors.
“3. A person’s facial features might change, but as long as he hasn’t
received any special training, he will often act like himself, such as
the things he prefers to eat, his gait, actions he’s used to performing,
and many other details.”
Fors nodded as she listened.
“Miss Audrey isn’t the innocent, naive teen that the rumors about her
suggest. She has a meticulous heart and a calm sense of observation.”
“Is that so?” Xio asked, doubtful. She didn’t expect an answer as she
changed the topic by suggesting, “I’ll be in charge of gathering the
information. Can you consolidate that pile of gold pound’s, no—that
admiral’s hobbies and unique traits?”
Fors opened her eyes wide open and shook the steel box containing
her cigarettes.
“How can you bear to do this? How can you bear to make a dainty,
sensitive author do consolidation, analysis, and deduction?”
Xio shot her good friend a glance as she exuded an air of authority
without realizing it.
“There’s an interesting paragraph on deduction in your Stormwind
Mountain Villa.”
Fors pulled her shoulders back and lowered her head. She looked at
the coﬀee table as she said, “Do you know how much of my hair I
pulled out, how much sleep I lost, just for that paragraph?”
She quickly lifted her head and looked at Xio Derecha, then lowered
her head once again and grumbled, “Life is short. There are too many
things that we need to do, why must we waste our time on such
uninteresting, menial tasks?”
That’s very reasonable… Xio nearly nodded in agreement. She fought
hard to keep her authority as an Arbiter.
“Then do you have any other ways to solve this problem?” She
suppressed her voice, making her childlike voice sound deeper.
Fors thought for nearly twenty seconds before looking up suddenly.
“We can hire a professional! After you ﬁnish collecting information
on Rear Admiral Hurricane, we shall erase the name and hand it over
to an excellent detective, then ask him to do the consolidation and
deduction. All we have to do is pay a fee!”
Why didn’t I think of that… Xio’s mind went blank. Fors and Xio
looked at each other without saying anything.
When the atmosphere became awkward, she cleared her throat.
“We’ll do it according to your suggestion.”
After saying this, she quickly added, “You’ll pay the fee!”
…
Howes Street, Divination Club.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Moretti.” The pretty receptionist Angelica
looked at Klein in surprise. “You rarely come on Fridays.”
Exhausted from searching for the house with the red chimney, Klein
smiled and said,
“Fate never repeats itself indeﬁnitely. It always brings us some
surprises.”
He was in the area, and the time had expired on the carriage he
rented; thus, he came for a cup of black tea and some rest.
Furthermore, this would serve as the ﬁnal layer of the foundations.
With the new “experience” at the Divination Club, he would logically
mention the application to Dunn Smith.
“Your words are always so philosophical,” Angelica praised.
Klein thought for a moment before saying with deliberation, “I might
not come to the Divination Club too often in the future, so you need
not recommend me to others anymore.”
He had already digested his potion, so he had to advance towards a
new goal!
“Why?” Angelica said in shock and puzzlement. “You’ve already
made a name for yourself in the club. Most people know that your
divinations are very accurate and miraculous. In fact, we were
considering getting you to come in on Sundays as a lecturer.”
If I was paid one pound for every divination I perform, then I would
keep doing this regardless of how tired I was… Besides, I still have to
investigate the houses with red chimneys and ﬁnd the culprit as soon
as possible… Klein smiled warmly.
“Madam, do not convince me to stay; this is the arrangement of fate.
“I won’t stop coming to the Divination Club entirely, it’s just that my
visits will become less frequent. I’ll still pay the membership fees on
time.”
I can get reimbursed for it anyway… I will come down occasionally
to monitor the place… Klein added in his heart.
“How regretful. I hope that you will be at the club when I happen to
be lost.” Angelica sighed.
She realized that this wasn’t as surprising as she imagined after the
initial shock had passed.
Perhaps such a miraculous seer that still respected fate wasn’t
someone who could be held back by a club in Tingen… Angelica
smiled, as if thinking about something.
“Sibe black tea?”
“Yes.” Klein returned a smile.
He spent about twenty minutes in the club, spending the time resting,
ﬁnishing his black tea before leaving the club. He took a public
carriage back to Daﬀodil Street.
When he entered, he opened the mailbox out of habit and saw that
there was a letter placed inside not too long ago.
Klein opened the letter and noticed that it was from Mr. Azik.
“… I will be heading to Morse Town on Sunday and return on
Wednesday.”
Most of the citizens in Morse Town are believers of the Goddess…
He’s heading there on a Sunday, which means that according to the
usual level of eﬃciency, the Nighthawks would only receive the
information on Tuesday or Wednesday. I can make it… To think that
Mr. Azik would remember my request… I hope that he remembers
not to do it personally. Him summoning a spirit and doing something
scary would suﬃce… Klein nodded slightly. He released his
spirituality and burned the letter with friction.
He ﬂicked his hand, turning the ﬂames into ashes and allowed them
to fall slowly onto the ground.
…
Saturday afternoon. Klein was wearing his black windbreaker and
hat. He had his cane in his hand as he walked slowly into the
Blackthorn Security Company.
After greeting Rozanne, he looked at the partition and noticed that
the Captain’s oﬃce was open. He deliberately spoke louder,
“Yesterday. I saw a girl who looked just like you at the Divination
Club.”
“Really?” Rozanne asked, her interest piqued.
Klein nodded without sincerity. “Yes, in fact, I thought that she was
your sister.”
“I’m sorry to have to disappoint you, but I have no sisters, not even
cousins.” Rozanne laughed. “Do you remember her name?”
“No, why would I remember her name?” Klein smiled. “Looking at
her was exactly like looking at you.”
“Can I take that as a compliment?” Rozanne was a chatty girl who
never needed others to start the conversation. She asked on her own
accord, “Klein, I would assume that you’re earning quite a bit from
the Divination Club? As a true Seer, your abilities are far beyond
those who take this as a hobby.”
We would still be good colleagues if you didn’t mention this… Klein
coughed.
“A Seer has to be respectful of fate. We cannot use divination to ask
for abnormal privileges.”
“Are you concluding your own maxim for a Seer?” Rozanne asked out
of curiosity.
“Yes,” Klein answered frankly.
After a brief chat, Klein said goodbye to Rozanne. He took his hat
and walked toward the partition.
Knock! Knock! Knock! He looked at Dunn Smith, who was drinking
his coﬀee, as he knocked on the open door.
“Please come in.” Dunn looked up at Klein and adjusted his posture
immediately.
Klein had already probed the Captain over the past two days. He
conﬁrmed that Dunn Smith hadn’t mentioned the “acting method” as
he was trying it out. It was clear that he was also cautious of the
higher-ups of the Church.
Thus he closed the door and sat across from Dunn. He said with a
serious, yet slightly excited expression, “Captain, I believe that I have
completely grasped the Seer potion. I wish to submit a special
application.”
Chapter 154: Sharing
"Experience"
As he looked into Klein’s eyes, Dunn took a deep breath and leaned
back. Then, he slowly exhaled as he spoke.
“Are you certain?”
There were minor changes in his facial expression. He seemed to be
well prepared for the special application, but he hadn’t expected it to
be so soon.
Captain, why do you look relieved… Klein didn’t conceal his smile as
he said, “I’m certain, Captain. When you fully master a potion, you’ll
feel a very special and magical sensation. You’ll have no doubt that
you’ve fully mastered the potion.”
“Special, magical feeling…” Dunn muttered those words softly and
his eyebrows slowly knitted together.
Huh, the Captain advanced twice without fully digesting the potion?
Of course, if he didn’t know about the “acting method,” it would be
diﬃcult to fully digest it. He must’ve used a prolonged period of time
to break it down and was subconsciously “acting” to minimize the
risk of losing control… Poor Captain… Klein quietly looked at Dunn
Smith, but he didn’t speak or say anything further so as to allow
Dunn to think carefully.
After almost a minute, Dunn’s deep eyes reﬂected Klein’s ﬁgure once
again. He weighed his words before he said, “Maybe it would be a
better option to wait another year.”
What the Captain means is that waiting another year would make it
less conspicuous. With the example that Madam Daly set for me, the
higher-ups wouldn’t pay too much attention to me. At most, I would
only be put on a list for observation , Klein thought and answered
frankly, “At ﬁrst, I wanted to wait until next year to send in my
special application. After all, there are too many things that I need to
master. For instance, my combat arts is only at the beginner level.
“But, Captain, don’t you think that we’ve experienced too many
coincidences in the last two months? We were chasing after the
kidnappers when we came across the Antigonus Notebook in the
opposite room. The shipment of Sealed Artifact 2-049 was delayed,
but Ray Bieber didn’t leave Tingen and tried to digest the power at
the harbor. I went to attend a birthday banquet and triggered Hanass
Vincent’s incident. I went to investigate at the library and ran into a
member of the Aurora Order…
“I don’t know what these coincidences mean, but I feel insecure.
That’s why I want to enhance myself in the best possible way.”
Klein seized the opportunity to talk about the manipulator behind the
scenes. It was something he had planned to include in his schedule—
without exposing his uniqueness, he would remind the Nighthawks to
make them search for more clues from diﬀerent angles. What he said
earlier would only lead the other Nighthawks to conclude that Klein
had a discerning mind and was good at organizing his thoughts.
The moment Klein said the word “but,” Dunn’s body leaned forward.
In the end, he steepled his ﬁngers in front of his mouth.
He ﬁxed his gaze and remained quiet, seemingly thinking about what
Klein had said.
After a while, Dunn lifted his head and said in a mellow and deep
voice, “Very perceptive… Perhaps there really is something lurking in
the dark.”
Without waiting for Klein to speak, he instructed, “You can submit
the special application.”
“Alright.” Klein lifted the corner of his lips when he answered.
He got up with a smile and walked towards the door. As expected, he
heard a familiar additional remark.
“Hold on,” Dunn called out. He weighed his words and said, “Take
note of your choice of words.”
Don’t worry, Captain. I place a far greater importance on this matter
than you do!Klein nodded in agreement with a smile.
At ﬁrst, he thought Dunn would propose that they avoid going
through the Holy Cathedral and instead advance to Sequence 8 in
secret. Then they could go through the normal procedure after three
years. However, after he thought it through, he realized that it was
impossible. Regardless of whether it was through a special
application or a normal application, the person who was going to
advance still had to be investigated by the Holy Cathedral; the only
diﬀerence was that one method was relatively simple and the other
was more complicated.
If he had become a Sequence 8 in secret, then it could put the entire
Tingen Nighthawks in trouble.
…
Since Klein was ﬁnished with his mysticism lessons, he didn’t go to
the basement in a hurry but walked to the clerk’s oﬃce next door
after leaving the Captain’s oﬃce.
He found a man and a woman sitting in the oﬃce. The man was in
his thirties and the woman was in her twenties; they were the two
newly added members.
They were surprised when Klein entered, then they smiled and
nodded in greeting. They were curious and in awe of the Beyonders
that they worked with.
Klein didn’t chat with them but found an empty desk and began
writing a draft for the special application.
As he already had a draft in his head, it only took about ten minutes
to complete his initial work.
After reading it a couple of times and amending parts of it, he sat
before the Akerson Model 1346 typewriter and started typing his
draft onto a document.
Listening to the tapping of the keyboard, the two new clerks
exchanged looks and stood up simultaneously. They left the oﬃce
and went to the reception hall to chat with Rozanne, allowing Klein
to have some privacy.
Very careful and fully aware of the need to maintain secrecy… Klein
stole a glance at their receding ﬁgures as he complimented them.
He focused on his work again and continued tapping on the
typewriter.
Just as he was going to complete his special application, Leonard
Mitchell came out of the restroom. He looked around while he
buttoned his shirt. There was an unrestrained beauty in his messy
hair.
“What’s the report you’re writing?” Leonard looked around the
clerk’s oﬃce as he leaned against the door frame with his right foot
tiptoed to balance himself and his hands tucked into his pockets.
His green eyes examined Klein with interest.
Klein typed the last word and the last punctuation mark. He then
turned his head and smiled.
“Special application.”
“Special application?” Leonard asked, puzzled.
Klein picked up the paper and skimmed through it quickly. He
casually explained, “A special application to advance to Sequence 8.”
Cough! Cough! Cough! Leonard suddenly coughed vigorously. He
calmed down and asked, –
Digest? Bro, you know quite a bit… Klein held his special application
and walked before Leonard. He lifted an eyebrow and said, “Yes.”
Then, he looked into his eyes and added softly with a chuckle, “I
remember someone told me once that there are some people who are
special, people who can do things that others can’t.
“Such as me.
“Such as you.”
Leonard was suddenly at a loss for words. He could only change his
standing posture and take his hands out his pockets to cross them in
front of his chest.
He opened his mouth and ﬁnally organized his words. He asked in a
low voice, “Don’t you think that it’s too risky?”
As he already knew about digesting, he deﬁnitely understands that
my advancement has no risk of losing control… Hmm, is he referring
to the attention from the higher-ups in the Church? Klein explained
while in thought, “Leonard, do you remember the ﬁrst task that we
worked on together? We were merely tracking kidnappers, but we
realized that the room opposite had clues about the Antigonus
family’s notebook…”
He repeated what he mentioned to Dunn once more.
Leonard’s expression grew heavy, and he nodded in agreement
slightly.
He muttered to himself and said, “Maybe, I have to hurry up…”
Just as he ﬁnished, he suddenly looked at Klein and ﬂashed a smile
as he said, “Aren’t you going to share your experience with us? The
experience to quickly grasp a potion and avoid the risk of losing
control!”
This guy sure can put on a facade quickly… Klein smiled and
answered, “I’m more than willing to.”
He was planning to seize the opportunity today to remind his
Nighthawk teammates on how to minimize the risk of losing control.
Of course, to maintain his personal safety, he couldn’t say it as
straightforwardly as he did to Dunn Smith. At most, he could
describe the idea vaguely, in a way that wouldn’t alert anyone who
was sent down by the higher-ups.
“Let’s do it now then!” Leonard impatiently dragged Klein to the
Nighthawks’ recreation room.
At that very moment, other than Royale who was taking her shift at
Chanis Gate, Frye, Kenley, and Seeka Tron were there playing cards.
“Everyone, everyone!” Leonard knocked on the half-closed door and
spoke as if he was reciting a poem, “Let me introduce this man next
to me, Mr. Klein Moretti, who has fully grasped his potion in a month
and a half!”
… This guy is so dramatic… Klein suddenly felt awkward.
“What?” Even Seeka Tron, the author who wasn’t famous and barely
sold any books, cocked her head sideways as though she was testing
her hearing ability.
“Leonard, don’t joke around. You’re always exaggerating things.”
Kenley covered his cards helplessly.
Frye held his cards as he looked at Klein. He kept quiet for a while
and said, “Are you sure that you’ve already fully grasped the potion?”
“Yes.” Klein could feel his concern and he nodded conﬁdently. “There
was an obvious indication.”
“What? Really?” Kenley shouted a delayed response and stood up.
Leonard chuckled and pointed at the paper in Klein’s hands as he
said, “This is the special application that he’s going to hand in. The
special application to advance to Sequence 8!”
“… How did you do it?” Seeka Tron had many questions, but she
only voiced the one that concerned her the most after taking a deep
breath.
She was normally quiet and elegant, but now she had a burning
passion in her eyes that couldn’t be suppressed.
Klein found a chair and sat down. He lowered his voice and
answered, “I found inspiration from the maxim of the Mystery
Pryers.”
“Do as you wish, but do no harm?” Leonard supplemented.
“Yes. According to our conﬁdential information, following this
maxim gives the Mystery Pryers a lower probability of losing
control,” Klein explained what he learned from Old Neil. “After that,
Madam Daly’s example gave me a better understanding of the
process.”
“Spirit Medium Daly?” Kenley asked in reply, hoping to gain
conﬁrmation.
“Yes. Madam Daly has handed in a special application before. She
only used two years to become a Spirit Medium from Corpse
Collector. She once told Old Neil that she wanted to be a real Spirit
Medium,” Klein explained in detail. “With the experience I gained in
the Divination Club and corresponding feedback that I’ve received, I
gradually concluded my Seer principles. Then I followed it strictly
and tried to become a real Seer… When I did so, I realized that the
speed at which I grasped the potion became faster.”
As they listened to Klein’s recount, Frye, Seeka, and the rest fell into
deep thought. Even Leonard pretended to be thinking.
“I’m going to hand in my special application.” Klein waved the paper
in his hands. “If you have any problems, do ask me privately.”
“Alright,” Frye replied coldly with a nod.
Klein left the recreation room and knocked on the door to the
Captain’s oﬃce again.
He sat down opposite to Dunn, then took up a pen and ink pad. He
signed and stamped his thumbprint.
“Captain, this is my special application.” After that, he passed the
paper to Dunn with both hands.
Dunn looked through it carefully and put down the application.
“I’ll submit it to the Holy Cathedral as soon as possible. You should
be prepared to be examined. Perhaps next week or the following
week.”
“Alright.” Klein took a deep breath and nodded seriously.
He stood up, exited the Captain’s oﬃce, and closed the door behind
him.
During the process, he thought about the application that he had sent
in. There was a thought that popped up in his head.
I wonder what kind of examination it will be…
Chapter 155: Urgent Meeting
After collecting himself, Klein went down to the basement and
walked to Chanis Gate. He knocked on the door to the guard room.
Inside, Royale Reideen had already packed her personal belongings.
She immediately smoothed her hair and stood up when she saw the
person taking over her shift.
After greeting each other with a nod, Klein suddenly said, “I’ve had
some success with grasping my potion and have shared my
experiences with Frye and the rest. You can ask them about it.”
Royale, who typically didn’t have much of an expression, looked at
Klein with a little shock. Her lips quivered a little as she said,
“Alright.”
Madam, let’s hope that you can still maintain your calm composure in a
while… There are already a bunch of dazed people sitting in the
recreation room right now.Klein laughed and made his way behind the
table, expertly taking out the tin can which Dunn Smith used to store
his Fermo coﬀee.
After making himself a cup of aromatic coﬀee, Klein sat down and
relaxed. He looked out at the lonely hallway and allowed his
thoughts to roam free.
Let’s hope that Mr. Azik’s mission is successful and that he doesn’t leave
behind any clues. Well, even if there are clues, I can just pretend to not
notice them.
I wonder where the Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem is sealed behind Chanis
Gate? Since it doesn’t possess any living qualities, it only needs a little
space…
Come to think of it, I haven’t been inside Chanis Gate. I’m not sure what it
looks like inside… To be able to keep the weird Sealed Artifacts of varying
sizes safe and maintain surveillance, it must be quite special indeed. For
example, the ashes of Saint Selena?
…
Many thoughts streaked past Klein’s head when he suddenly heard
urgent footsteps. He focused and shot a look towards the door.
He saw Old Neil, wearing his classic black robe, appear in the
corridor with a black carpet in his hands. He made his way into the
guard room and said nothing, but instead observed Klein thoroughly.
“Mr. Neil, did something happen?” Klein let out a dry chuckle and
took a sip of his fragrant coﬀee.
Old Neil sized him up and sighed.
“To think that you would ﬁnd inspiration from the maxim of the
Mystery Pryers and Daly…”
“I have to praise the Goddess. I also have to thank you for your
teachings.” Klein gave a reply in all seriousness.
Old Neil pulled back a chair and sat down. He said, a little depressed,
“How good would it be if it was twenty years ago…”
Klein maintained his silence, for he knew that Old Neil wasn’t
allowed to consume any more potions because of his age and health,
even if he had completely digested the one he had right now.
Under such circumstances, anything he said would’ve agitated him.
“My earliest thoughts was to quickly gain control of my potion from
the maxim of the Mystery Pryer, but regrettably, I wasn’t embarking
in the right direction. Daly’s success did give me some clues, but I
was already more than 50 years old back then, and had already given
up on my eﬀorts. I subconsciously thought that her success was a
result of her genius, and that an average person wouldn’t be able to
emulate her achievements.” Old Neil rubbed his temples as he
described his disappointment.
He was silent for a few minutes before he lifted his head. He looked
at Klein.
“It sure is regrettable that only now do I understand what I’ve missed
out on at this age.”
Old Neil should’ve had a faint understanding of the “acting method.” He
immediately understood what happened after I shared my experiences…
Klein consoled, “It wouldn’t have made too much of a diﬀerence. The
Church doesn’t hold the Sequence 8 corresponding to Mystery Pryer.”
“Perhaps the Holy Cathedral does have it… No, if they have it, they
would at least tell us its name. It’s also possible that the underground
market might have it…” Old Neil muttered. He shook his head as he
stood up. He laughed and said. “At least I didn’t lose control, and I’ve
lived healthily for decades… Praise the Lady.”
He drew a crimson moon in front of his chest and left the guard room
a little dejected. He had lost his usual shrewd look.
Klein looked at Old Neil’s back and suddenly let out a long sigh.
He was even more perplexed as to why the higher-ups of the Church
would hide the “acting method.”
Klein collected himself after some time, placing his attention on the
conﬁdential information of the Nighthawks in front of him.
Ever since he pulled the youth from the City of Silver into the Tarot
Club and learned that the City of Silver still used the ancient names
for many things, he found it necessary to enhance his knowledge in
these areas.
Some time later, he heard another set of footsteps. These footsteps
were slow and steady.
At the same time, an image of Dunn Smith wearing a black
windbreaker ﬂashed past his mind.
My spiritual senses have been elevated after fully digesting the Seer
potion… Klein nodded in understanding. He saw the Captain a few
seconds later.
“A letter for you.” Dunn extended his right arm and ﬂicked his wrist,
tossing the letter over to Klein.
Klein lifted his hand and tried to grab the letter, but be it his
judgment or reaction, he missed.
Pa!
The letter fell onto the ﬂoor, leaving Klein’s right hand extended
awkwardly in the air.
Under the suddenly silent atmosphere, his right hand ﬁrst became
rigid, then he pulled it back toward his head and pretended to
smooth out his hair.
“The light from the gas lamp isn’t bright enough,” Klein made a
perfunctory statement casually. He bent his back and picked up the
letter, giving it a cursory glance.
Mr. Hornacis… It’s a letter from Daxter Guderian… He nodded in
understanding and pulled open a drawer to retrieve a letter opener.
According to the rules of the Nighthawks, if there was a clear and
correct recipient, Rozanne and the rest of the clerks would give the
letter directly to the person that the letter was addressed to. If the
recipient was anonymous or an unknown name, it would be handed
over to Dunn. He could then ask around or make a decision.
Klein carefully pried open the letter and took out the piece of paper
within. He quickly unfolded the piece of paper and read through it.
He realized that the asylum doctor, Daxter, was asking for an urgent
meeting at two in the afternoon today.
Has he obtained the Telepathist formula? Or is it regarding something
else? Klein lifted the letter in his hand and looked at Dunn.
“Captain, my informant, the one from the Psychology Alchemists,
wishes to meet me at two in the afternoon.”
“Did he say anything else?” Dunn asked, as if he was expecting this.
“No.” Klein shook his head.
Dunn thought for a moment, then said in a heavy voice, “Get Leonard
to watch over Chanis Gate for the time being. I’ll go with you and
hide somewhere. These urgent requests to meet could sometimes be a
trap. I’ve heard of many similar incidents. Furthermore, if it’s
something important, we can act quickly.”
Captain, you sure are experienced… Not to mention being the most
reliable, trustworthy Captain without memory issues whenever we have
something serious to do… Klein immediately nodded.
“Alright!”
…
At two in the afternoon. Inside the small shooting range 9 of the
Zouteland Street Shooting Club.
Klein looked at the target that was covered in bullet holes, then
glanced at the uneasy Doctor Daxter Guderian.
“What happened for you to look for mercenaries at the Hound Pub in
such a ﬂuster?”
Only by doing so would the boss of the Hound Pub, Wright, hand the
letter immediately to the Blackthorn Security Company instead of
waiting for Klein to collect it himself.
Daxter observed Klein’s expression and body language, then
responded softly, “I ﬁnd Hood Eugen a little abnormal recently.”
Hood Eugen was the patient from the mental asylum that had roped
Daxter into the Psychology Alchemists.
“What sort of abnormalities has he exhibited?” Klein pressed,
displaying his professionalism.
Daxter heaved a sigh of relief, as if he had found a pillar of support.
He said while deliberating his words, “H-he seems to have really
gone insane…”
“Really gone insane?” Klein asked in shock.
Didn’t Hood Eugen feign his illness and inﬁltrate the mental asylum to
attempt to inﬂuence the patients in order to train his mental abilities?
He had really turned sick, genuine insanity?
“I think so…” Daxter paced around anxiously. “I could hold a normal
conversation with him in the past and receive guidance on how to
correctly use my Beyonder powers. But in the past few days, his
thought processes and his condition has become really weird. I can
barely communicate with him. He was just like my other patients,
even though… even though I’ve managed to get the Telepathist
formula as a result. But I cannot determine if it’s real or fake. I’m
afraid that there might be some uncontrollable changes that might
occur.”
No matter. As a Seer, a Seer who has the mysterious world above the gray
fog, I’ll be able to determine if it’s real or fake… Klein heaved a sigh of
relief before creasing his brows and asking, “Did he come into
contact with anyone before he turned abnormal?”
“Only the patients. I-I cannot guarantee that, though. I’m not in the
asylum for the whole day. I also need time to rest,” Daxter said, his
expression serious.
Klein nodded, as if it was something trivial.
“Don’t worry. I’ll send someone to protect you in secret. You should
ﬁnd out who Hood Eugen has come into contact with as soon as
possible. Also, you have to be careful; he might be testing you. You
should also report this to the members of the Psychology Alchemists
and see how the higher-ups of your organization react.”
“Alright.” Daxter propped up his golden spectacles, recovering the
calm of a Spectator. He then took out a piece of paper from his
pocket and handed it over to Klein. “This is the formula for the
Telepathist potion, but I cannot guarantee its authenticity.”
“We will verify it.” Klein smiled in response. He unfolded the piece of
paper on the spot and looked at it.
“Main ingredients: The complete pituitary gland of a mature Rainbow
Salamander, 10 ml of spinal ﬂuid from a Farsman Rabbit.”
“Supplementary ingredients: Chestnut Spore 5 grams, Dragon Tooth
Grass Powder 8 grams, 3 petals of Pure White Elf Flowers, Pure
Water 100 ml.”
“Excellent,” Klein praised. He folded the piece of paper and stuﬀed it
into the inner pocket of his tuxedo.
After exchanging a few more words and ascertaining that the “voices”
which Daxter was hearing were subsiding, Klein bade him farewell.
He cautiously made his way to the shooting range reserved for the
Nighthawks. Dunn Smith was waiting inside.
“Captain, the informant gave me the Telepathist formula to thank me
for helping him control the side eﬀects of the potion, but he cannot
determine the authenticity of the potion.” Klein handed the piece of
paper to Dunn with a stern expression. “Furthermore, he mentioned
something else…”
Dunn read the formula as he listened to the concerns about Hood
Eugen. After that, he nodded.
“I’ll immediately assign manpower to keep the mental asylum under
surveillance. You haven’t had professional training when it comes to
these matters and don’t to participate in this. Go back and guard
Chanis Gate.”
With that said, he looked at Klein deeply in the eyes and said, “If we
take this formula into account, you don’t need to accumulate any
more meritorious achievements. You can directly receive the Clown
potion after you pass the examination…”
Chapter 156: Melissa Who Takes
the Long View
And I’m paying double for the Clown’s formula… And all this
because I originally wanted to be rewarded double for the same piece
of work I did. Forget it, I don’t have the opportunity to mention that I
already have the formula to the Clown potion.Klein took a deep
breath and forced a smile, saying, “Hopefully I can pass the
examination smoothly.”
He was more than happy with Dunn’s decision for him to continue to
guard Chanis Gate. Not only was he lacking the professional ability to
monitor and investigate, but his hand-to-hand combat was far from
satisfactory.
In terms of shooting, he was considered decent compared to the
ordinary police. However, his teammates were all Beyonders that
have had their physical attributes enhanced. Even if they weren’t all
marksman-level, they were very close.
As for hand-to-hand combat, Klein was merely a beginner.
Even with a Slumber Charm, a Repose Charm, and a Dream Charm,
he was still considered a support-class Beyonder. It would be easy for
him to deal with ordinary people, but he would be in danger if he
were to come across any Beyonders who were adept at combat.
Until I advance to Sequence 8, become skilled in technique-based
battles, and master a handful of spells, I can only complete normal
supernatural missions on my own. Hmm, if I successfully steal the
power of Sealed Artifact 3-0782 and make Flaring Sun Charms, that
will be even better. It won’t be impossible for me to win from a
position of an underdog… Klein thought hopefully as he slowly
walked back to the Blackthorn Security Company.
The next morning when he ended his shift and left Chanis Gate, the
Nighthawks still hadn’t obtained any useful information from
monitoring Hood Eugen. For now, they had to place their hopes on
their informant’s internal investigation.
When he returned home, Klein had his breakfast quietly and laid
down in his bedroom to sleep until noon.
He woke up naturally, washed up, and walked to the ﬁrst ﬂoor,
following the smell of cooking food.
“Melissa is preparing lunch?” Klein looked at Benson who was
reading the newspaper in the living room.
Benson lowered the newspaper and said, “Yes, she has a guest
visiting today. I wanted her to chat with her guest while I prepared
lunch. But she doesn’t trust my cooking and took the guest into the
kitchen. How rude.”
Benson, you actually managed to quickly realize that Melissa detests
your culinary skills… Klein held back his urge to laugh and walked
towards the single seat sofa as he asked, “Melissa’s guest?”
“Yeah, you should know her. Elizabeth, we met her at Selena’s dinner
banquet.” Benson leaned backwards and continued to read his
newspaper comfortably.
It wasn’t only at the dinner banquet… She came to visit for real…
Klein turned to look at the kitchen with a stunned expression.
Just then, Melissa walked out carrying some plates and Elizabeth
followed behind, also wearing an apron.
“Klein, you’re already up? I was just planning on waking you up.”
Melissa laid the plates on the dining table delightedly as she said,
“This is Elizabeth. You know her.”
“Hello, Klein.” Elizabeth’s adorable face ﬂashed a splendid smile as
she greeted him.
Klein replied gently and politely.
After they greeted, Melissa blinked and spoke seriously, “Elizabeth
will follow us to the Family Servant Assistance Association later.
They hire a few maidservants at home, so she has experience in that.
Her opinions might be helpful.
“Actually, we’ve already drawn up the requirements for picking a
maidservant. Listen to this and see if there’s anything that needs to be
added.”
Melissa wiped her hands on her apron and took out a piece of paper
from the pocket of her home clothes. She opened it and read it out
loud.
“1. Healthy.
“2. Hardworking and responsible.
“3. Good at cooking.
“4. Quiet, not rowdy.
“5. Simple family background.
“6. Looks ordinary.”
…
She read the requirements one by one while Klein and Benson
gawked with a vacant look; they never expected that hiring a
maidservant would be so troublesome.
“Melissa, weren’t you against the idea of hiring a maidservant?” Klein
subconsciously asked when his sister stopped.
Melissa pursed her lips and nodded solemnly.
“Yes, I was against it. But as my opposition was in vain, I thought we
should get this thing done properly. To be able to get it done well, we
must be well prepared. Hmm, do you have anything that you’d like to
add?”
“No!” Klein and Benson shook their heads in unison, causing
Elizabeth to laugh.
After lunch, the four of them took a public carriage to the Tingen
Family Servant Assistance Association on Champagne Street.
It was similar to domestic help ﬁrms that Klein knew of from his
previous life, but it was also a little like a charity. They recorded the
personal information and job requirements of diﬀerent maidservants
so that the clients could make their selections more easily, while
maximizing the maidservants’ chances of employment.
Part of the organization’s funding came from charity organizations,
and some came from a percentage of the payment provided by
employers.
Upon entering the association, Klein and company were greeted
warmly. A young lady in a pale yellow ruﬄed dress led them to some
sofas. She smiled and asked, “How may I help you?”
Benson, who was pushed forward by his brother and sister, said, “We
need to hire a maidservant.”
“Do you have any requirements?” the young lady asked like
clockwork.
Benson recalled his siblings’ lack of faith in his culinary skills as he
said sincerely, “Good at cooking.”
“Good at cooking?” The young lady creased her eyebrows and said,
“To be frank, there are no excellent cooks among the maidservants.
Why not hire a chef instead? If you need a female chef, we have quite
a number of them in the association.”
“There is no one who is good at cooking among the maidservants?”
Melissa couldn’t help but cut in as her initial plan was set back.
The young lady nodded and answered aﬃrmatively, “The
maidservants are either the daughters of lower class laborers or girls
from the villages. They have few opportunities to learn culinary
skills. Even after the simple training provided by the association, the
most we can guarantee is that their food won’t make people sick.”
Melissa fell silent, ﬁnally realizing what it meant to have situations
outpace her plans.
“That is regrettable.” Benson thought, reorganizing his words, he
said, “Maybe we can amend our requirement to a maidservant who is
willing to and is capable of learning to cook.”
Not bad. Benson is quick-witted… There’s no need for me to interject.
Klein sat by the side, holding his cane and hat comfortably.
“No problem. During cooking training, we took note of girls who had
outstanding performance,” the young lady replied with a professional
smile. “Any other requirements?”
“Yes.” Benson felt the burn of Melissa’s gaze. He swallowed his saliva
and took out the piece of paper from his pocket. He then read the
items one by one.
The young lady listened quietly and only responded after quite a
while.
“I-I’ll ﬁrst check through the records and recommend some
maidservants that ﬁt the criteria. You don’t have to decide
immediately. You can pick two to four of them. Then, I will bring
them each over to cook for you once. You can decide who to employ
then. Of course, you will have to pay the association some extra fees,
and you will also have to prepare your own ingredients.”
“Alright.” Benson folded the paper and nodded politely.
The young lady stood up and walked towards the oﬃce, but she
turned around after taking two steps. She smiled and said, “Can you
pass me that paper? I’m worried I will forget some of your
requirements…”
“No problem.” Benson held back his urge to laugh when he
answered.
After a while, the young lady in the pale yellow dress came out with
a stack of documents and passed them to Benson.
The information had each of the maidservants’ real name, birth date,
family situation, facial description, health status, past experience,
related traits, expected salary, and other information.
Seizing the opportunity when Benson and Melissa were reading the
information, Elizabeth got closer to Klein and asked softly, “Don’t
you have any requirements?”
“Yes, but this information isn’t speciﬁc enough,” Klein answered
perfunctorily.
Elizabeth got even more interested.
“How would you choose?”
Klein smiled and pointed at the hidden pendulum in his left sleeve, “I
would divine the best person to become our maidservant by writing
down a corresponding statement about each candidate and
eliminating them one after another.”
“…” Elizabeth was stunned, nodding vacantly after nearly twenty
seconds. “The simplest and the most eﬀective way… I totally forgot
that you’re…”
She didn’t ﬁnish her sentence since Melissa, who had sharp senses,
noticed that they were whispering and had looked over.
She looked at her best friend and her brother, then she showed an
expression of deep thought.
Hey, Sis, don’t misunderstand! We are just talking normally… Klein
coughed and picked up some of the information and casually read
through them.
Very soon, they picked three candidates. They were asking for four
soli eight pence to ﬁve soli two pence per week.
Benson didn’t haggle over the maidservants’ pay but instead
discussed the percentage that he needed to pay to the association.
After some friendly haggling, he successfully negotiated the price
from the maidservant’s two weeks pay to one week pay instead.
However, he had to pay a transportation fee of one soli for them to
bring the maidservants over to try cooking.
After that, Elizabeth bade the trio farewell and left while the siblings
took a public carriage back to Daﬀodil Street.
On the way back, Klein was getting uncomfortable under Melissa’s
scrutinizing gaze. When he got home, he went to the second ﬂoor
directly.
“Klein,” Melissa called him in a serious tone after thorough
consideration. She said, “If you want to get engaged with Elizabeth,
you have to work harder. Her father is an important businessman,
and her mother is the daughter of a baron…”
Wait, engaged? When did this happen? Klein looked at his sister in
confusion.
How far reaching is her concern?
Chapter 157: Item of His Dreams
“No, we are not…” Klein didn’t have the chance to retort before
Benson interrupted with a smile. “Although Elizabeth is indeed a
little young and her family is much more outstanding than ours, I
ﬁnd the two of you quite suitable for each other. But you might have
to wait a few more years. She is still studying at a public school and
wants to enter university. Marriage should be something to consider
only six to seven years later. Of course, you can get engaged sooner
than that.”
… Can you guys not think that far ahead? Klein took in a deep breath.
“I do not fancy Elizabeth, or, well, more accurately, I do not fancy a
girl who is younger than me by too much. I prefer girls who are more
mature.”
Truthfully, I can accept anyone within a reasonable age gap, just not
now… He added inwardly in exasperation.
“You like girls who are more mature?” Melissa knitted her brows.
“Then you should quickly settle the issue regarding your marriage.”
Ah? Klein couldn’t understand his sister’s leap in logic. He asked in
confusion, “Why?”
Melissa explained seriously, “You will be about 25 when you ﬁnish
saving up for your marriage. Girls that are more mature than you will
either be married or engaged when they reach that age. Do you want
to chase after a widow?”
What the… Klein thought to himself in Mandarin as he wore a blank
expression.
Benson smiled and refuted his sister, “Melissa, you don’t understand.
In this day and age, it isn’t rare to see women in their thirties who
isn’t married or engaged within the middle class. They are mostly
followers of the Goddess, and all have the ability to provide for
themselves. They would rather be single than stuck in a marriage that
they are not satisﬁed with. Yes, that’s what I read from the ‘Family’
magazine.”
“Is that so?” Melissa was a sixteen-year-old girl after all. She didn’t
have a great understanding concerning matters like this.
Upon seeing his siblings getting roused up from the conversation,
Klein coughed and said, “What I meant by mature is their mental
state. They don’t need to be older than me. Furthermore, the person
that should be worried about their marriage is Benson.”
I’m sorry, Brother, I had no choice… he apologized in his heart.
“…” Melissa froze for a moment, then nodded heavily. “That’s right!”
Benson was just about to elaborate on the marital problems of the
middle class when he suddenly shivered. He looked at his sister who
was staring at him and said, “I am now at the cusp of a turning point
in my life. I have to devote all my attention to studying. I will only be
conﬁdent of chasing after my desired girl when I have found a job
that I’m satisﬁed with and have a reasonable amount of savings. Only
then will I be able to provide her with a good life.”
Klein and Melissa froze, then asked in unison, “You have a girl that
you fancy?”
Benson, who had merely given a perfunctory reply, was shocked. He
shook his head in a hurry.
“No! I was merely giving an example!”
…
In a dark, gloomy house of Backlund, Hillston Borough.
A middle-aged man with graying hair sat silently on a rocking chair
in front of an unlit ﬁreplace with a dark colored pipe in his hand. He
looked at the guest on the sofa.
He was the master of this building, Isengard Stanton, a private
detective with notable fame. But he didn’t set up an oﬃce, merely
hiring assistants to assist him.
Isengard, who was dressed in a white shirt and black vest, brought
the pipe to his lips and inhaled in an intoxicated manner before
slowing exhaling.
“The fee for a thirty minute consultation is one pound. If I were you,
I would deﬁnitely not waste a second.”
The two ladies on the sofa across from him were Fors Wall and Xio
Derecha. They had found materials relating to Rear Admiral
Hurricane Qilangos and wanted to ask this detective to consolidate
the habits and actions of their target.
Of course, they had removed Qilangos’s name and changed the
description regarding supernatural incidents.
Xio Derecha handed the folder containing the documents to
Isengard’s assistant, a browned-haired young man wearing gold-
framed spectacles.
“Mr. Detective, I hope that you can ﬁnd habits in the target’s actions
using the material we have provided.”
Even though she wasn’t tall, Xio Derecha had an air of authority
when she sat straight and spoke with a deep voice.
Isengard stared at her and received the docket from his assistant. He
opened the folder and took out the material within.
He set down his pipe and focused on reading page after page without
missing a single one.
Ten minutes later, this gentleman slowly tapped on the handle.
“The target has an obsession with the wind… He won’t stay for long
in a polluted area in Backlund, the Capital of Dust. In other words, he
could be staying at the Empress Borough, West Borough, Hillston
Borough, Cherwood Borough, or the suburbs of the North Borough…
“The target is a psychotic serial killer with the need to kill someone
every other day… The most logical thing he could do is to target the
vagrants that have nowhere to go. Even the police have no records of
the exact number of vagrants in Backlund…
“The target wouldn’t be living in an area too near or too far from
North Borough or Backlund Bridge, which have the highest
concentration of vagrants… It would be the act of someone
unsophisticated to search for victims that are too close to him. That
isn’t consistent with your descriptions… If the target has to spend a
large amount of time before he can ﬁnd someone to murder, then he
might lose control of his desires and commit crimes that would easily
expose himself…
“The target is an experienced sailor and has exceptional mobility in
the water… A reasonable deduction would be that he wouldn’t be
living somewhere too far away from the water. If anything
unexpected happens, that would be his best means of escape…”
…
“In summary, we can outline the possible radius of activity for the
target. He should be living somewhere close to the Backlund Bridge
area. Perhaps somewhere close to both banks of the Tussock River—
the West Borough or the Cherwood Borough…”
…
“I can only deduce this from the materials that you have given me.”
Even though they didn’t understand all of it, his deductions seemed
to make sense. Xio and Fors looked at each other and nodded. They
took back their materials and stood up to leave.
Seeing his assistant send oﬀ the two ladies, Isengard took out a
bronze item from his vest pocket. It was an open paperback book. In
the middle of the book was a vertical eye.
Isengard rocked his chair, rubbing the item while softly muttering to
himself, “Qilangos has inﬁltrated Backlund?”
…
In a particular basement of Pritz Harbor.
The Hanged Man Alger sat in a chair, looking coldly at a struggling
man.
This man was dressed like a sailor. His head was enveloped by a ﬁlm
of pale-blue water and his face was purple from holding his breath.
He was scratching at the ﬁlm on his face with both hands, but all he
could do was ﬂick droplets of liquid.
Finally, he could no longer hold his breath and gave a signal of
submission.
Alger smiled, then nonchalantly clapped his hands.
The thin ﬁlm of water dispersed, turning into droplets that fell to the
ground.
The sailor took in a deep breath and coughed violently. He coughed
so hard that it tugged at his heart and lungs.
After waiting for the man to recover, Alger leaned back. He emulated
the peaceful and calm tone of The Fool.
“Tell me the reason why Qilangos went to Backlund.”
“H-he’s there to complete a commission, but I’m not sure about the
details.” The pirate had completely lost the will to resist. He
answered honestly, “All I know is that he might receive something
that he wants. Qilangos once boasted in front of us. He said that if
this mission was a success, he would be able to obtain something he’s
dreamed of getting for a long time. The Four Pirate Kings would then
become the Five Pirate Kings.”
An object he’s been dreaming of obtaining? Alger knitted his brows and
slipped into deep thought.
…
Klein didn’t rest on Monday morning. He followed his plan and
continued his investigation on the buildings with red chimneys in
Tingen.
Unfortunately, he didn’t come across his target.
He returned home near noon. He heated up the leftovers from
yesterday’s dinner and paired them with bread before taking an
hour’s nap.
At about twenty minutes to three in the afternoon, Klein put his book
down and sealed his room with a wall of spirituality, once again
entering the mysterious world above the gray fog.
He sat at the seat of honor at the ancient bronze table, extending his
hand toward the crimson star representing Sun while ignoring the
frequency of his heartbeats.
In the City of Silver.
Derrick Berg was sweating on the practice grounds. His vision
suddenly blurred as a heavy fog entered his view. He saw The Fool
sitting high above, deep within the fog.
He froze, then stopped whatever he was doing and bowed his head.
When the illusion vanished, he counted his heartbeats silently and
carried his silver sword to a rest area quickly.
A thousand heartbeats later, he locked himself in a bathroom.
After about ten breaths, he saw the red light swell over him and
swallow him in an instant.
Above the gray fog, Klein leaned back into his chair and tapped his
left molar twice to stealthily activate his Spirit Vision.
He saw that the mottled color deep within The Sun’s Ether Body had
turned pure, akin to the light of dawn. He smiled and said,
“Congratulations, Mr. Bard.”
At the same time, he saw the stars behind The Sun’s chair shift
quickly, turning into the symbol of the Sun.
It transformed without my will, as if it was a reﬂection of the Sun. Also,
other than the palace, table, and chairs, the items that I conjure cannot be
preserved once I leave this world… They are very special… There sure are
many secrets to this world above the gray fog… Klein took in everything
in front of him as he contemplated.
Derrick lowered his head and replied humbly, “This is all due to your
assistance. This is but the beginning.”
He wasn’t surprised that The Fool knew that he had consumed the
potion.
Klein took out his silver pocket watch and looked at the time. He
chuckled and said, “Then let us start the gathering. Remember, the
frequency, or should I say gap between the gatherings should be
about the same in the future.”
As he was speaking, he established a connection with the crimson
stars representing Justice and The Hanged Man before pulling them
into the majestic palace.
Audrey looked at the scene before her and immediately greeted him.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Fool. I have a page of the diary of Emperor
Roselle with me.”
“Good afternoon, Mr. Sun. Have you gotten the formula for
Telepathist?”
Chapter 158: Preparedness
Averts Peril
How enviable it is for Miss Justice to always maintain a cheerful mood. I
wish I could be like that… Listening to her lively greetings, Klein
couldn’t help but sigh wistfully.
He then recalled the time when she had taken out a thousand pounds
so easily, and he realized that it would be very diﬃcult if he wanted
to maintain his cheerful emotions like Miss Justice.
The Sun, Derrick Berg, was a young man that cared a lot about his
reputation. He immediately replied, “I have obtained the Telepathist
formula.”
For the past week, he had been settling the inheritance that his
parents had left him. Besides the property, furniture, and a few
sentimental items, the rest of the valuable items were brought to the
black market in the City of Silver in exchange for the Telepathist
formula and the Bard potion’s ingredients. His meals were now
rationed.
However, he believed that the situation wouldn’t be for long. When
he passes the combat examination, he would then join the team that
cleansed the Things of the Dark in the outskirts of the city and be
paid a decent amount.
When I become stronger, I’ll apply to become a member of the elite squad,
to explore the depths of the dark and ﬁnd a way to remove the curse…
Derrick thought with hope as he looked towards The Fool who was
engulfed in the fog.
He noticed that last time, after Miss Justice made a request to Mr.
Fool, she was able to produce a page of the unknown Roselle diary
out of thin air!
Although Derrick didn’t quite understand what had happened, he felt
that it’d be better if he watched Mr. Fool.
“First, recall the formula in your head. Then, grab the pen by your
side and instill it with the strong desire to express your thoughts.”
Klein casually leaned back in his high chair.
As The Sun was from the City of Silver, which might be the Forsaken
Land of the Gods, the pen that instantiated before him wasn’t a
fountain pen, but a quill instead.
Of course, there still wasn’t any ink.
Derrick didn’t dare to doubt what The Fool said, so he immediately
grabbed the quill that suddenly appeared by his hand.
He followed The Fool’s instruction, and as expected, he saw the
Telepathist potion formula appear on the brown goatskin parchment
before him within seconds.
After looking through it twice, Derrick silently pushed the promised
item towards Miss Justice.
Audrey was overjoyed and eager, but she took the parchment
gracefully. She glanced at the page, and the words that Klein had
translated came into sight.
“Main ingredients: Phantom Netherdrake’s complete pituitary gland,
10 ml of Half Specter Rabbit.
“Supplementary ingredients…”
Main ingredients that I’ve never heard of… Hmm, I don’t know enough.
Audrey, who had been trying to learn more about the diﬀerent types
and names of Beyonder ingredients from Fors and Xio, seemed to fret
in thought.
During such moments, she would completely forget how a Spectator
should behave.
Suddenly, Audrey heard a light rapping sound. She quickly looked
towards the seat of honor at the long bronze table subconsciously.
She was surprised to see Mr. Fool rapping at the edge of the table
with his right index ﬁnger while he gestured to her with a nod.
What’s going on? Audrey was confused as her eyes wore a vacant look.
Just when she was about to ask, the corner of her eyes suddenly saw
some changes on the Telepathist formula. There were remarks next to
some of the ingredients:
“Main ingredients, Phantom Netherdrake’s complete pituitary gland
(also known as Rainbow Salamander), 10 ml of Half Specter Rabbit
(also known as Farsman Rabbit).
“Supplementary ingredients…”
I know all of these! Audrey was stunned at ﬁrst, then there was an
intense surge of delight from the bottom of her heart.
“Thank you, Mr. Fool. You’re really very knowledgeable.” She looked
towards the seat of honor as she thanked and sincerely complimented
him.
The Hanged Man Alger didn’t know what had happened, but he felt
extreme contempt towards what Justice had said.
How could you describe a godlike ﬁgure with the word “knowledgeable”?
His existence alone is equivalent to knowledge itself to a certain extent!
Klein accepted Miss Justice’s compliments without any misgivings
because this wasn’t something he could’ve done just because he had
chanced upon the Psychology Alchemists’ Telepathist formula.
After he pulled The Sun into the Tarot Club, he had been taking
precautions against such problems by taking into consideration The
Sun’s special circumstances of being from the City of Silver. He had
been constantly studying ancient terminology. Therefore, even if
Daxter Guderian hadn’t managed to get the formula in time, he
could’ve made the notations easily. Through prior divination and
comparison, he had made certain that both Telepathist formulas were
accurate.
This is why we say, “Preparedness averts peril…” Klein thought smugly.
Audrey looked at the Telepathist formula a few times and then reined
in her gaze unwillingly. She then personally expressed Roselle’s diary
onto a page.
“You deserve this.” She put down her pen and looked towards the
fog-engulfed Fool. “In addition to this, I’ll give your adorer another
300. Is 300 pounds okay?”
She sounded a little guilty because the three pages of Roselle’s diary
only cost her twenty pounds, while the Sheriﬀ formula at Sequence 8
required 450 pounds.
In other words, from the perspective of simple math, she had to pay
another 430 pounds on top of the three pages of the diary.
However, Audrey felt that it was thanks to her luck that the seller
didn’t know the value of Roselle’s diary. It allowed her to buy it at a
low price.
Emperor Roselle’s diary costs at least ﬁfty pounds per page! Audrey held
her ﬁst and encouraged herself.
300 pounds? Until today, I’ve only seen that much money at Sir
Deweyville’s place…Klein sighed and pretended to not be interested in
money as he nodded and said, “A reasonable deal.
“This is my adorer’s information.”
He avoided speaking of terms like “Backlund Bank” and “anonymous
account” verbally through The Fool’s mouth as they damaged his
image. He made them appear on the parchment before her.
Klein had taken time to visit Backlund Bank’s Tingen branch last
Wednesday while investigating the houses with red chimneys. He had
disguised himself and opened an anonymous bank account.
The account only required one to memorize his account number and
the corresponding password in order to withdraw cash from any
Backlund Bank branch.
If one found that it wasn’t secure enough, he could also request to
add in a signature and thumbprint veriﬁcation. But that would be
more troublesome.
In order to keep his identity secret, Klein left it with a password.
The password is written in ancient Hermes: “The Fool that doesn’t belong
to this era, the mysterious ruler above the gray fog; the King of Yellow and
Black who wields good luck.”
As ancient Hermes itself can be used for rituals and prayers, anyone who
dares to copy the password would be reciting my name. Then, I’ll
immediately receive a signal, and can simply ﬁnd out who’s the one trying
to steal my wealth from the world above the gray fog! Klein was very
satisﬁed with the idea that he came up with.
The only downfall was that it would slightly expose the existence of
The Fool, but the risk was within an acceptable range.
Audrey pushed the diary page to Mr. Fool as she took the parchment
with the information of The Fool’s adorer. Recorded on it, was the
Backlund Bank and a bunch of numbers that formed the anonymous
bank account.
I wonder if Mr. Fool’s adorer is a male or female, and which Sequence he
or she is…Hmm, he must be very powerful, at least not weaker than
Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos… Audrey couldn’t stop her
thoughts from wandering.
But she quickly focused and memorized the anonymous account.
“It doesn’t have to be so troublesome.” Just then, she heard The
Fool’s low yet gentle voice. “When you get home, recite my name and
you’ll be able to write down the information directly.”
This would be just like when I drew the red chimney scene through
divination… An account number is very important, you can’t memorize it
incorrectly… Klein added in his head.
That works too? From Mr. Fool’s words, he appears very conﬁdent. He
lives up to his status of a godlike ﬁgure if he can even do this… Audrey
was stunned at ﬁrst before coming to the realization that everything
seemed to make logical sense.
But, why did I have to memorize the formula earlier? Audrey was
suddenly confused again.
At that moment, Klein pressed down on the page of Roselle’s diary,
but he wasn’t in a hurry to read it. He looked to the side at The Sun
and calmly asked, “What compensation would you like?”
Derrick thought seriously and said, “As of now, I don’t have anything
that I desperately need… I should digest the Bard potion very soon. I
shall wait until then to request my compensation. Yes, perhaps to
prepare for the corresponding Sequence 8 formula or the necessary
ingredients.”
Sequence 8 is Light Suppliant, which I have… but the ingredients. Even if I
had them, I would have no idea how to give them to you. Wait, he used
the word digest… Indeed, the City of Silver knows of the “acting
method”… Hmm. The highest Sequence there is only Sequence 4, so are
they limited by ingredients? Klein nodded in deep thought, agreeing to
the deal.
Audrey also sharply noticed the word “digest.” She weighed her
words and asked, “Mr. Sun, are you aware of the ‘acting method’?”
Derrick looked at Miss Justice in confusion and answered
straightforwardly, “It’s nothing strange… The general education
classes in the City of Silver teaches the ‘acting method.'”
The “acting method” is taught in general education classes… Audrey
stole a glance at The Hanged Man and realized that he was looking
back at her. The two of them suddenly fell silent.
The origin of The Sun is indeed mysterious. I wonder where Mr. Fool
pulled him into the Tarot Club from… The more I think about it, the more
I revere him… Audrey settled down and looked at The Fool who didn’t
look visibly surprised in any way.
Then, Alger probed, “Mr. Sun, do you talk about any key things to
look out for with respect to the ‘acting method’?”
“Yes.” Derrick nodded without hesitation. “It’s clearly stated in our
general education classes that the one and only key point for the
‘acting method’ is to ‘Remember that you’re only acting.'”
As expected… We’re using an ingenious method to go around obstacles
and completely break down the remnant spirits in the potion, without
submitting to it… The Sun, you’re such a simple boy. You just shared
important information by accident… Klein smiled and cast his eyes on
the diary page before him.
Chapter 159: Bestowment and
Sacriﬁce
Messy Chinese sentences were scribbled on the yellowish-brown
goatskin.
“2nd August. This goes deeper than I imagined. History sure is
something that can be manipulated easily.
“5th August. I witnessed the abilities of a High-Sequence Beyonder
today. It was scary indeed. There’s a qualitative change that has
happened to them in a particular aspect, it was as though they’ve
transformed into a deity. It’s no wonder that we describe them as
‘Demigods’, though I think calling them ‘Legendary beings’ is more
ﬁtting.
“6th August. There’s something strange going on. Why would the
Seven Major Churches adopt such a strange attitude towards the
potions? At the low to middle Sequences, they not only provide the
main ingredients to those who managed to advance, but they’re also
generous enough to share the formulas and demonstrate the process
needed to create the potion. They would also explain in detail if a
ritual is needed to create the medicine, yet ﬁnished potions are the
only things they provide to those who are advancing to the higher
Sequences.
“This isn’t logical. Shouldn’t they keep the formula a secret for the
lower Sequence potions and give the candidate the completed potion
since it’s relatively easy to gather the necessary ingredients and
create the potion? As for the higher Sequence potions, shouldn’t they
share the formula and make the promising members search for the
ingredients due to the diﬃculty of obtaining the main ingredients?
“There must be some hidden secret to this.
“9th August. The events of the past two days have made me feel
uncomfortable. I started the Industrial Revolution with my own
hands and personally ushered in the Age of Steam and Machinery,
but this will create the conditions necessary for the Evil God to
descend upon this world?”
What does he mean? The conditions necessary for the Evil God to
descend upon this world? Klein knitted his brows, his index ﬁnger
tapped on the edge of the ancient table.
Did Mr. Fool encounter a diﬃcult problem? Anything that can
trouble him must be something of another level… Audrey looked at
the leader obscured by the thick fog and interpreted his state through
his body language.
Klein was indeed pondering over the problem related to the upper
echelons, but he didn’t arrive at an answer. He considered the
possibility of using divination to gain some sort of revelation.
Yes, it would be impossible to divine something of use with such
simple sentences. I’m not a prophet… What if I divine with the
statement, “the conditions necessary for the Evil God to descend upon
this world”? It feels too risky… The Evil God might not be as
horrifying as the Eternal Blazing Sun, but its abilities might be much
more mysterious. It might be able to trace the divinations back to me.
There’s also no way to divine how large of a risk I’ll be taking if I
were to divine that statement. After all, just divining if something
poses any danger is dangerous once it has deities involved…
I’ll keep this question in mind and put more eﬀort into observation.
The arrangement of the Churches regarding potions is indeed
mysterious. I wonder what kind of secrets they’re hiding? Perhaps I’ll
receive some hints about that once Spirit Medium, no, Spirit Guide
Daly is made Archbishop or a high-ranking Deacon and enters the
core of the Church…
Roselle’s description does make me look forward to the power of
High-Sequence Beyonders…
Many thoughts ﬂashed through his mind before Klein stopped
tapping on the edge of the ancient table and looked at Justice, The
Hanged Man, and The Sun.
“You can start your discussion freely now.”
Alger immediately said, “Mr. Fool, Miss Justice, I received a new
piece of information. Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos inﬁltrated
Backlund to complete a diﬃcult mission. He might stay for an
extended period of time and create an appalling tragedy. Also, I know
that this incident involves a very important item, an item that would
allow Qilangos to quickly become a High-Sequence Beyonder.”
“Quickly become a High-Sequence Beyonder? Does he not fear losing
control of himself?” Audrey asked, adopting the posture of a
Spectator.
Qilangos was only a Sequence 6 Wind-blessed, so there was still a
Sequence between him and Sequence 4.
Alger had expected this question. He answered honestly, “That’s why
the object is important to him.”
“Of course, those are simply my deductions. The information I
received goes like this: Qilangos believes that once he completes the
commission and obtains the object, he will be the equal of Nast, the
King of the Five Seas. The Four Pirate Kings would then become the
Five Pirate Kings, and the Seven Pirate Admirals will be reduced to
six.
“The average person might not aware of this, but as Beyonders, we
should know that Pirate Kings are either High-Sequence Beyonders,
or are able to reach the combat strength of a High-Sequence
Beyonder with the use of Beyonder boats and mysterious items. For
Qilangos to be acknowledged as their equal, he must reach standards
that are close to that. That’s my deduction.”
All I know is that the King of the Five Seas, Nast, is a Sequence 4
Beyonder, but I’m not sure of the name of his potion… Klein listened
on silently, not giving his opinion.
The Sun, Derrick Berg, didn’t understand anything The Hanged Man
said. He didn’t know who was who, but he still listened attentively.
He felt a new door had presented itself in his world.
Pirates? The place they live in has seas that are mentioned in books?
Then, the environment these people live in is very diﬀerent from the
City of Silver… They don’t seem to be very worried about the curse
or the attacks of the Things of the Dark. It deﬁnitely makes me very
curious… But, Mr. Fool once instructed me not to ask about the
secrets of others. It’s a very rude gesture… Derrick thought in his
heart, once again observing The Hanged Man and Justice.
“You deduction is very reasonable. Of course, that could also be a
mysterious item that could hold its own against a High-Sequence
Beyonder,” Justice replied with a smile.
The Hanged Man looked at the fog-enshrouded Fool, pondered over
his words, before he looked at Justice and emphasized, “There are
two key points in what I said just now, the ﬁrst being the fact that
Qilangos will stay in Backlund for some time. The second is that the
incident involves a very important and very mysterious object.”
So, Mr. Fool, are you not tempted? There is ample time for you to
send your adorer to Backlund… Alger added in his heart but didn’t
dare say it out loud. All he could do was beat about the bush.
Mr. Alger, you don’t need to emphasize this repeatedly, I know what
you are getting at… But my abilities do not allow me to interfere in
these matters. Furthermore, I can’t leave Tingen without
permission… Klein leaned back and thought in frustration.
Ignoring the adorer, I can actually ﬁnd two relatively strong
Beyonders to help…
One is Daly, who has advanced to Sequence 6, but I cannot tell her
everything. The most I can do is mention that I’ve gotten some
information that Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos has inﬁltrated
Backlund and is living at a particular street and what he plans to do.
That way, Daly might directly enlist the help of the Nighthawks,
making the situation very complicated and troublesome… If you guys
cannot ﬁnd anybody to help you when the time comes, then I can try
that to prevent a tragedy…
The second person is Mr. Azik, but I cannot expose my identity as
The Fool to him. I don’t have a proper reason to get him to interfere
with this incident…
Many thoughts ﬂashed through his mind as Klein replied slowly, “I’m
aware.”
Seeing how The Fool continued to not place much importance in the
matter regarding Qilangos, he sighed and held back his
disappointment. He started asking about the investigation Miss
Justice conducted last week.
“… In conclusion, we have more or less targeted the general area
Qilangos will be at, and we’ll soon start the next phase of
investigations.” Audrey ﬁrst gave a simple summary, then with the
attitude that she was doing something important, said, “We need
more information, preferably the hobbies and habits of Qilangos.”
Alger recalled, “He loves ﬁsh, especially ﬁsh from the sea. He would
slice it and eat it raw…
“He also likes hard liquor, and despises champagne, red wine, and
the like…
“He will often look for women to relieve his needs whenever he
heads to shore, and with his strong body, one woman will not be
enough to satisfy him…
“He’s used to using cold weapons and avoids hot weapons.
“He cannot be away from water for long periods of time. What I
mean is that he needs to swim or dive once every couple of days.”
…
Audrey committed these facts to memory, creating an ample
character of Qilangos in her mind.
“Let’s hope that the investigation will be a success. It’s a pleasure
working with you.” She smiled after Alger was done.
“My pleasure.” All Alger could do was force himself to believe in Miss
Justice, who had considerable power in Backlund.
Throughout the interaction, Klein seemed to be listening intently, but
in reality, his thoughts had been diverted to another question. That
was the question of how to deliver ingredients to Sun if he did
manage to obtain them.
Now that he had a passable understanding of the ﬁeld of mysticism,
Klein instinctively followed the line of thought of using ritualistic
magic. This reliance was natural given the successes he had when
using ritualistic magic.
When I was previously ﬂipping through the conﬁdential information
of the Nighthawks, I came across records of the Goddess bestowing
holy items to her followers. There were also records of items
descending in rituals involving evil gods or devils… Does this mean
that I can “bestow” someone something when responding to their
prayers, and transfer materials that way?
In previous attempts, I could only reply with thoughts containing
pictures and voices. But that doesn’t mean that it’ll always stay that
way… There could be some new changes when I advance to
Sequence 8…
There’s also something important to consider. Can I bring material
from the real world into the world above the gray fog? And…
Hmm… Oh right, there’s often a step for “sacriﬁces” in rituals
involving evil gods and devils! Can I consider “sacriﬁcing” something
to myself?
In that way, perhaps I can bring some material from the real world
into the world above the gray fog…
If this attempt is successful, I can get items directly from Justice, The
Sun, and The Hanged Man, and then bestow them to myself.
Yes, “sacriﬁce” is considered a more advanced ritual, so I won’t be
able to learn of it for now…
The most important thing to do now is to improve my abilities!
Klein reined in his thoughts, and once again listened in on the
conversation of the other members. He listened as their discussion
changed from Qilangos to the characteristics of particular monsters.
Some time later, he smiled.
“Let’s end it here for today.”
“By your will.” The Sun, Justice, and The Hanged Man stood up at
the same time.
After severing the connections of the members, Klein quickly
descended from the fog and left the mysterious space.
When he returned to his room, he dispelled the wall of spirituality
and pulled back the curtains by the oriel window, allowing the
sunlight to shine in.
There are two important things to do this week. The ﬁrst is to get
examined and advance to Sequence 8. The second is to make Flaring
Sun Charms. Its powers might be even higher than that of Sequence 7
or 6… Klein looked outside with anticipation.
Tomorrow. I should be able to receive the report of Mr. Azik’s
paranormal disturbances tomorrow!
Chapter 160: Seizing the
Opportunity
Tuesday morning.
Having completed his mysticism curriculum, Klein didn’t look for a
quiet corner to read “Comparison of Ancient and Modern Names” or
“Nighthawks Case Compendium,” and instead stayed in the break
room to play cards with Leonard, Kenley, and Royale.
I only told Mr. Azik to create an opportunity for me to take Sealed
Artifact 3-0782 out… It’ll still depend on my improvisation skills to
seize the opportunity… Klein’s mind wasn’t on his cards, so he played
terribly. He lost ﬁve soli in an hour, and he felt the pinch. He
planned to concentrate on the game to recover some of his cash.
After he bought various ingredients for the Flaring Sun Charms
yesterday afternoon, his private stash of cash reduced to less than one
pound once again. Plus, he had to pay two soli every day for the
carriage rental fees to search for the house with the red chimney.
As they were waiting for Kenley to shuﬄe the cards, he picked up the
copper penny before him and spun it casually.
He suddenly felt Royale’s gaze on him, a very intense gaze.
What? Klein was ﬁrst stunned, then looked at the copper penny that
was about to fall.
… Is she wary of me cheating with divination? We’re just playing
cards amongst ourselves, do we have to be so serious about this? He
suddenly understood and slammed down the penny with a dry laugh.
Just then, Dunn Smith knocked on the door and entered. He looked
around and said, “There’s a situation in Morse Town. Leonard, please
handle it.”
Morse Town? Klein felt his mind jolt as he pretended to ask
curiously, “Captain, what kind of situation?”
Dunn glanced over and explained, “Recently, there have been a few
paranormal cases in the area. Firstly, people would hear sobs when
walking past the cemetery and see vague ﬁgures ﬂash by. Then, a
widow encountered her deceased husband when she woke up to use
the bathroom in the middle of the night. She nearly fainted from the
fright. In addition, there was an elderly man who lived alone. He
began hearing heavy footsteps reverberating in the house all the
time. However, silence reigned once again the moment he lights a
candle or gas lamp. The people in the town are believers of the
Goddess, so the local priest reported the situation.”
No one got hurt, and it almost borders on the level of a prank…. It
should be Mr. Azik… Klein used an expression and tone that he had
rehearsed many times. “Captain, there might be a secret link for these
paranormal cases to happen so suddenly. In this situation, divination
could provide an important clue. I think I can help Leonard.”
Upon hearing that, Leonard’s green eyes immediately locked onto
Klein. He was apparently trying to ﬁnd clues and traces from Klein’s
face.
Dunn nodded ﬁrst, but remained quiet and hesitant.
When Klein saw the Captain’s response, he immediately added,
“Some of these things might require ritualistic magic to purify them.”
“Makes sense.” Dunn thought and said, “You and Leonard will head
to Morse Town then.”
Without anyone saying anything else, he additionally added, “Hmm,
you won’t be able to make it for your combat training in the
afternoon. I’ll send someone to inform Gawain.”
Phew, the ﬁrst step is complete… Klein silently let out a sigh. He
quickly packed away his soli and pence.
Then, he suddenly paused and looked sideways at Dunn. He said
solemnly, “Captain, I think we should prepare for the worst. If there’s
a powerful wraith behind the paranormal events, it might be very
dangerous for only Leonard and I. Plus, it takes two, uh—three hours
to get to Morse Town, right? Even if we manage to send a telegram to
request for backup in time, we would still have to hold out for quite a
while…”
“So?” Dunn interrupted.
“I want to get the assistance of another teammate.” Klein pretended
to think for a moment and said, “And, according to the rules, a
mission with three or more Nighthawks involved can apply for a level
three Sealed Artifact. Yes, 3-0782 is most suited for this job.”
Upon hearing that, Leonard laughed and said, “Exactly your style.
Careful, cautious, taking no risks.”
You seem to be implying that I’m a coward… I’m a person who
looked directly at the Eternal Blazing Sun! Klein pretended that he
didn’t hear Leonard and earnestly looked at Dunn Smith.
“Captain, what do you think?”
“We should really take extra care against any accidents. There have
been too many coincidences lately…” Dunn nodded thoughtfully and
looked at the other two teammates. “Kenley, join Leonard and Klein
on their trip to Morse Town. Oh, hurry up and write an application.
After I sign it, retrieve Sealed Artifact 3-0782 from Chanis Gate.”
“Alright,” the short Kenley said, putting down the cards in his hand.
Alright! Klein ﬁst-pumped in his mind while he looked anxious and
solemn on the outside.
At that very moment, Seeka Tron was monitoring Hood Eugen in the
asylum while Frye was on duty at Chanis Gate.
Klein left the recreation room and put on his black tuxedo. He took
his hat and cane, then waited together with Leonard for Kenley at the
stairway that connected to the basement
There was no one there, and it was extremely quiet. Leonard
suddenly looked sideways at Klein and said, “I think you’d better give
up on any unrealistic dreams.”
“Ah… What?” Klein replied in confusion.
Leonard walked forward and stood by the edge of the stairs. He
looked into the darkness of the stairway.
“Even during a mission, it will be impossible for you to discover my
secret and understand my uniqueness.”
… Bro, can you stop thinking so highly about yourself? Did you think
I applied for this mission to spy on you? I didn’t even have such
thoughts! Enlightened, Klein chuckled.
“How can you be so sure that my uniqueness won’t help to reveal
your secret?”
Leonard’s expression grew grave, but he then smiled and said, “It
will, huh? I shall wait for you to discover it then.”
When I gather more information and items, I will go to the world
above the gray fog to help you do a divination. You’re welcome!
Klein thought sarcastically in his head.
Soon, the small-framed Kenley brought the Mutated Sun Sacred
Emblem up the winding stairs.
When Klein felt the unique warmth and purity, he secretly heaved a
sigh of relief. He knew that he had ﬁnally completed the very ﬁrst
and most diﬃcult step in his plan of siphoning the powers of the
Eternal Blazing Sun’s divine blood.
Then, the three of them left the Blackthorn Security Company and
walked to Zouteland Street. They walked towards the carriage that
belonged to the Nighthawks.
“Will the purifying eﬀect bother the horse?” Kenley suddenly asked
anxiously. “I don’t want a horse that can only praise the Sun to pull
the carriage…”
He had been a Nighthawk for longer than Klein, but he was far from
experienced.
“No, Sealed Artifact 3-0782 only puriﬁes living entities with a high
level of intelligence,” Klein lowered his voice in response.
If not, I wouldn’t be bitten by insects… he added blankly in his head.
“Oh, I see… Haha, I didn’t read the information thoroughly enough.”
Kenley pressed down on his black silk hat and laughed in
enlightenment.
As Klein had yet to master the skill of driving of a carriage, he sat
inside the carriage for the following three hours. He rubbed the
Sealed Artifact 3-0782 in his hand while he watched Leonard and
Kenley take turns driving.
They ﬁnally arrived at Morse Town around lunchtime.
“How beautiful…” Kenley complimented sincerely as they stepped
down from the carriage and looked towards the boundless golden
wheat ﬁelds that surrounded the town.
The dates representing the Volcanic constellation was coming to an
end, and the Bumper Harvest constellation was going to rule
everyone’s life.
Leonard was in the driver’s seat as he looked around and opened his
mouth, as though he was going to recite a sonnet.
But in the end, he only spurted one sentence, “How beautiful.”
Klein held back the urge to laugh as he put on his top hat, took his
cane, and got oﬀ the carriage.
At that moment, a middle-aged man in a black priest’s gown walked
over. He drew a crimson moon on his chest and said, “Praise the
Lady. Are you the friends that Saint Selena Cathedral sent to help
us?”
“Yes, Priest Siur. May the Goddess bless you.” Leonard jumped oﬀ the
carriage and replied with a smile, “We’re here to take care of the
recent paranormal incidents.”
“Seemingly. Seemingly.” The gray-haired, blue-eyed Siur saw many
townsfolk approaching as he quickly emphasized.
Morse Town wasn’t big. Regardless of which direction one chose to
travel in, one would enter the plains within ten minutes. The people
who stayed there knew each other, so what happened earlier had
spread.
Many townsfolk were waiting for the Church of the Evernight
Goddess to send people to resolve the problem. Hence, when they
saw that the priest was greeting three strangers, they quickly
surrounded them out of concern and curiosity. Some tiptoed and
some tried to hear what they were saying.
Leonard chuckled and said, “Priest, don’t worry. We’re professionals.
Look, we brought Holy Water, silver daggers, Dark Sacred Emblems,
and also garlic.”
He took out the described items from the inner pockets of his clothes
as though he was pulling a magic trick.
Garlic? Are you trying to stink the spirits to death? Klein found it
ridiculous yet funny as he watched Leonard’s performance.
Siur wore a look of confusion, and he even started to suspect that the
Saint Selena Cathedral had sent over a bunch of frauds.
The citizens who surrounded them revealed gratiﬁed smiles, as
though they were ﬁnally in safe hands.
Leonard got close to Priest Siur and explained softly into his ear,
“They believe in these things…”
Without waiting for the priest’s reply, he added, “Let’s have lunch at
the church ﬁrst. Then, we shall take care of those matters.”
Yes, lunch is very important… When those paranormal incidents are
taken care of, it’ll be time to take turns looking after Sealed Artifact
3-0782, and also the opportunity for me to make Flaring Sun
Charms… Hopefully, everything goes smoothly… Of course, making
Flaring Sun Charms during the daytime would get the best results…
Klein thought, brimming with anticipation.
Chapter 161: Inverted
Mausoleum
Most of the buildings in Morse Town adhered to a style that was
popular a hundred years ago. The most eye-catching building in the
town was the black cathedral spire.
After settling the carriage, Klein and the others quickly ﬁnished their
lunch of bread, toast, bacon, butter, and coﬀee.
“We can still tolerate about two hours and thirty-ﬁve minutes of
Sealed Artifact 3-0782’s puriﬁcation.” Kenley stood at the door of the
church and took out a pocket watch from his suit’s pocket. “I suggest
dealing with the suspected haunting incidents ﬁrst to prevent the
situation from getting worse. Then we can return to the church and
take turns watching over the Sealed Artifact to recover.”
Under normal circumstances, Sequence 9, 8, and 7 Beyonders had to
stay far away from the Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem for two hours to
recover completely, or at least an hour if they were to make a partial
recovery.
“Alright.”
“I have no objections.”
Klein and Leonard spoke in unison.
“Then which case should we deal with ﬁrst?” Kenley asked.
Leonard wiped away his frivolous attitude and said, “Let’s start with
the old man living alone who heard heavy footsteps in his house.”
“Why?” Kenley asked instinctively. Klein was also interested to hear
an explanation.
Could this be the intuition of a poet? He mocked Leonard secretly.
Leonard shifted his gaze from Kenley’s face to Klein’s, then looked at
Kenley again. He smiled.
“Because it’s the closest to the church.”
“How did you know that? It’s not written in the records…” Klein
asked.
Leonard snickered. “Didn’t I go to the bathroom during our meal? I
came across a trainee priest on my way back and had a conversation.
He told me that Noah’s house was close to the church—Oh yeah, the
old man’s name is Noah.”
He sure lives up to his name as an experienced Nighthawk when it comes
to performing missions… Klein gave a dry laugh. He turned to Kenley
and said, “Then let’s go to Noah’s house ﬁrst.”
“Alright.” Kenley didn’t have any objections.
They arrived at Noah’s house a mere minute later…
Noah was an old man with thinning white hair. He had lost his left
hand in a war when he was younger and had no choice but to leave
the army. He returned to his hometown after he received his
compensation.
At that moment, he opened the door and looked at the three
strangers in front of him before looking at Siur who was rushing over
from the cathedral. He said with a raspy voice, “Come in, I hope that
you can solve my problem. I heard that you brought Holy Water,
Sacred Emblems, a silver dagger, and garlic? This is great, my
worries have eased greatly. Please forgive my blabbering, you have to
understand the condition of an old man after not being able to sleep
peacefully for two nights, Oh my Goddess, I’ve been so scared all this
time that my head feels like it’s in a cloud.”
Leonard suddenly straightened his back when he entered the house,
his eyes surveying the surroundings.
After that, Klein felt a cold aura within the room. Those were traces
of activity left behind by a ghost.
“There really was an impure being here.” Kenley was the last one to
notice as he suppressed his voice.
“Very weak.” Leonard said with a relaxed tone as he retracted his
gaze.
The Midnight Poet was a job with a relatively high spiritual
sensitivity when compared to all the other Sequence 8’s in the
Church’s records.
“Yes.” Klein could feel the warmth and purifying energy of Sealed
Artifact 3-0782 quickly dispelling the sinister aura in the room
without any trouble.
At this moment, the people of the town had all gathered at Noah’s
house, all looking curiously at Klein, Leonard, and Kenley.
Cough! Leonard cleared his throat and recited, “We have the blessings
of the Goddess, those impure beings will vanish quickly and won’t
bring about any more trouble.”
After that, he shot a look at Klein for him to perform a “puriﬁcation
ritual” for everyone to see.
Why me? Klein shot a look back.
Of course, he didn’t know if Leonard understood what his gaze
meant.
But clearly, Leonard understood. He said softly, “You’re the expert in
rituals.”
Alright, blame me for being the one who volunteered for this mission.
Klein tidied his clothes and took out the Holy Water, Sacred
Emblems, a silver dagger, and garlic from Leonard.
He ﬁrst placed the Dark Sacred Emblem in front of his chest, then
peeled the garlic and tossed its cloves one by one to every corner of
the house.
“Hmm, this is how garlic is used to dispel ghosts?”
“It’s diﬀerent from the descriptions in the newspapers…”
“Will this work?”
…
The townsfolk looking at them broke into discussion, curious and
excited, as if they were watching a circus.
It’s useless! I’m just acting! Klein suddenly felt that he had become a
clown. He closed his eyes and splashed the holy water onto the
ground with the silver dagger.
He splashed the water as he walked around the house, reciting an
incantation, “The Evernight Goddess…
“The Mother of Secrets… The Lady of Crimson…
“Empress of Disaster and Horror…
“Mistress of Calm and Silence…”
…
These typical acts of a charlatan shocked everyone present as the
townsfolk fell silent.
And once people turned silent, it was easy for them to notice
something they missed.
“What a warm feeling.”
“It feels like I’m sunbathing…”
“No, I feel like I’m looking at a pure sky…”
“How magical… Is this the eﬀect of the Holy Water?”
“They sure live up to their names as priests from Saint Selena
Cathedral!”
“Praise the Lady!”
…
The townsfolk discussed in whispers. The looks they gave Klein,
Leonard, and Kenley slowly became that of respect. Noah also visibly
relaxed, not doubting that the problem had been solved.
Sealed Artifact 3-0782 is doing all the real work here… We don’t actually
need to do anything to chase the ghosts away, all we need to do is stay
here for a minute. It’s not tiring or troublesome at all… After Klein
puriﬁed the sinister aura oﬀ every corner of the house, he opened his
eyes and put away his silver dagger, drawing the shape of the
crimson moon in front of his chest with a serious expression. “Praise
the Lady!”
“Praise the Lady!” the townsfolk replied devoutly.
“We still have things to deal with, but we need absolute silence.”
Leonard smiled as he looked around.
The townsfolk, after witnessing something so professional, didn’t
stay. They receded from Noah’s house like a tide following Priest
Siur’s lead. Even the master of the house had to leave temporarily.
“I actually wanted to take a nap…” Noah pouted as he walked
toward the cathedral.
Leonard took a step forward and closed the door, then turned
towards Klein.
“Do a divination on the cause of this incident.”
“No problem.” Klein also wanted to ﬁnd out what he could divine.
I know Mr. Azik did this, but he seems to be of a rather superior nature.
Haha, a person that can live for 1300 years must be of a superior
nature… So my divinations should deﬁnitely be aﬀected. Under such
circumstances, without the help of the mysterious space above the gray
fog, even I’m not sure what revelations I would receive… Klein took out
the pen and paper he brought along with him and wrote down a
divination statement:
“The cause of the haunting at Noah’s house.”
He held the piece of paper and walked to a round table. He then took
a seat, closed his eyes, and leaned back.
Klein suddenly saw a black mausoleum in his blurred, hazy dream
world.
It was similar to a pyramid, but stood inverted and was almost fully
buried.
A black fog obscured everything within the ancient mausoleum.
Klein snapped awake and opened his eyes.
“Did you ﬁnd anything?” Kenley asked in concern.
Klein thought for a moment and described the revelation he received
in his dream without hiding anything. He ended it by saying, “The
mausoleum was deﬁnitely not in the style of the Northern Continent,
I mean the Fifth Epoch. I’m somewhat of an expert in this ﬁeld.”
Leonard nodded, seemingly in thought.
“That’s an Inverted Pyramid from the Southern Continent. It
represents the entering of the nether realm from the living world. It’s
a mausoleum that only the so-called Descendants of Death can erect
for themselves, be it in the Balam Empire of the past, or its satellite
states such as the Highlands Kingdom.
“In some sense, it’s the symbol of Death.
“Well, the ghosts are deﬁnitely related to Death. The results of the
divination are undoubtedly correct!”
Ignoring Leonard’s mockery, Klein suddenly had an interesting
thought.
Could Mr. Azik be the descendant of Death, or could he have made a
transaction with Death to obtain such a long life?
According to a chapter from The Revelation of Evernight, as well as the
internal records of the Nighthawks, Death was a malevolent god, once
causing a catastrophe in the Northern Continent at the end of the Fourth
Epoch. Those times were now referred to as the Pale Era.
Hmm, it’s said that Death fell to the combined eﬀorts of the Seven Gods…
It’s impossible to determine when Lamud Castle was built — but it
couldn’t have been built before the Pale Era.
If there was a connection, then there would be something to investigate
regarding the person working behind the scenes, lives in the house with the
red-chimney, and stole the skull of Mr. Azik’s child…
Of course, this could be an excuse for the Northern Continent to colonize
the Southern Continent. After all, most of the inhabitants of the Southern
Continent believes in Death…
The three Nighthawks didn’t stay for long since they didn’t discover
anything. They soon left Noah’s house and started dealing with the
two other haunting incidents.
The same process, the same results. They quickly rid the town of the
auras of dead spirits, but didn’t manage to ﬁnd the cause of all the
trouble.
Along the way, Leonard asked the townsfolk if any strangers had
entered the town in the past few days, but received a negative
answer.
Mr. Azik didn’t come? He must’ve come and left in secret without anyone
noticing him. He sure is cautious… When he said that he would be
returning to Tingen by Wednesday, did he mean that these spirits would
vanish on their own accord today, even if we weren’t here to deal with it?
Klein thought about it as he returned to the entrance of Morse
Cathedral with Leonard and Kenley.
They could still last another hour and forty-ﬁve minutes with the
Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem.
“We’ll take one hour shifts looking after the Sealed Artifact.” Klein
suppressed the excitement in his heart. He looked at the color of the
sky and said, “Let’s try to head back to Tingen City for dinner.”
“No problem.” Leonard glanced at Klein and laughed. “But for
safety’s sake, I suggest that two people look after the Sealed Artifact
while one rests.”
Klein froze for a moment, his mind churning quickly. He smiled in
reply.
“Sure, but this way, we have to calculate the most logical rotation.
Who gets to rest ﬁrst? Who’s next? And who will be last? How much
time do we need to recover? And by how much? Well—I think that
we have to establish an algorithm with an unknown value in order to
establish the best way, then compare it with the eﬀectiveness of
having one person look over it at a time… It’s even better if we can
compare the eﬃciencies too. Let’s ﬁrst assume that the unknown
value is…”
“Wait!” Leonard’s green eyes were ﬁlled with blankness and fear. “If
that’s the case, let’s look after it one at a time. The person looking
after it will stay in the cathedral during his shift, as it has a
suﬃciently large radius. Of course, we’ll have to get Priest Siur and
the rest to stay somewhere else. The other two will stand guard
outside the church and prevent others from coming close.”
“I share the same opinion.” Kenley had felt a headache coming on as
Klein spoke about the mathematical problem.
“Alright.” Klein nodded, looking as though he was forced to do so.
If he hadn’t been able to convince his partners, then he would have
to make a deal with Leonard in secret, giving away some information
about himself to get him to leave.
But the problem was solved now!
Chapter 162: Intense Sunlight
Weak light shone through the narrow window from high above,
making the interior of Morse Cathedral a little more visible.
Klein put his top hat on his knee while he leaned his leg against his
cane. He sat quietly on the ﬁrst row of the left pew and looked at the
altar before him.
There weren’t any statues of the Goddess except for a massive Dark
Sacred Emblem. Its base was black, with a crimson half-moon that
was surrounded by radiant points of light.
On the wall behind the Sacred Emblem, there were a few openings
which allowed sunlight to shine in from the outside. They were
focused into tiny specks of pure light which combined with the dark
surroundings to form a scene that resembled that of a lofty starry
night sky.
None of the traditional Gods ever left behind an actual image. Only their
symbols are worshiped and gloriﬁed by people… That seems to be a
manifestation of the command, “Do not look directly at God”… Klein let
his thoughts wander. He wasn’t in a hurry to make the Flaring Sun
Charms as soon as he got the opportunity to be alone with Sealed
Artifact 3-0782.
He felt that he had to be careful, patient, and had to wait. Within the
ﬁrst ﬁfteen minutes, it was possible that Leonard and Kenley would
enter at any moment to remind him about points that he should take
note of.
In this extremely quiet atmosphere, time ﬂew by quickly. Klein
suddenly snapped back to his senses as he took out his silver vine-leaf
pocket watch, ﬂipped it open, and took a glance.
Twenty minutes have passed… He muttered to himself. He then set his
silk top hat and silver edged black cane by the side. He got up and
walked towards a hidden corner near the altar.
At ﬁrst, he faced the side of the altar, but once he saw the large Dark
Sacred Emblem and the holy scenery that resembled a depiction of a
night sky, he felt guilty and uncomfortable. Hence, he turned his
back to the altar.
Then, Klein took out the Sealed Artifact 3-0782 from the inner pocket
of his black tuxedo. He bent down to place the golden unadorned
badge on the ground.
Klein took a look at the Sun symbol that was ﬁlled with abstract
meanings, then he took out a small candle mixed with sandalwood.
He put it right at the bottom of Sealed Artifact 3-0782.
That was the dualistic ritual that he learned from the Eternal Blazing
Sun. He used an item that was closely related to the deity to
represent “Him” while he used the candle to represent himself.
He took a deep breath to ease his tense emotions. Klein then took out
the items required for the ritual, one after another, including a
carving knife, two thin gold slices, Sun essential oil extracted from
the combination of black-rimmed sunﬂower, golden-rimmed
sunﬂower and white-rimmed sunﬂower, Golden Hand ﬁngered citron
powder, and also rosemary powder.
After that, Klein adeptly used the silver ritual dagger to guide the
ﬂow of spirituality. He guided it to ﬂow around the simple altar and
created a shapeless sealed wall.
He squatted down, placed the silver dagger down, and extended his
right hand. He lit up the candle that represented himself by rubbing
his spirituality.
Under the ﬂickering dim light, Klein picked up the Sun essential oil
and dripped a drop onto the ﬂame.
With a puﬀ, an illusory fog spread out with the slight scent of
sunlight.
After burning the ﬁngered citron and rosemary powder, Klein held
the carving knife and golden slices. He stood up, took a step back,
and then recited in Hermes, “The blood of the Eternal Blazing Sun.
“You are the Inextinguishable Light, the Embodiment of Order, the
God of Deeds, the Guardian of Businesses.”
…
Inextinguishable Light, Embodiment of Order, God of Deeds, and
Guardian of Businesses were all parts of Eternal Blazing Sun’s
honorable titles. If there wasn’t the preﬁx of the blood of the Eternal
Blazing Sun, the ritual would require the god’s response to proceed. If
so, Klein suspected that the Eternal Blazing Sun would recognize him
as the disrespectful person that looked at “Him” directly. Then,
Leonard and Kenley would only ﬁnd a pile of black ashes when they
entered.
Plus, the ritual had to be conducted via Ancient Hermes, a ritualistic
language that stemmed from nature. Only a language without any
protection but had outstanding eﬀects could allow an incantation to
sidestep around the Eternal Blazing Sun and point towards the
Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem.
At the same time, as he was stealing the power from a deity, Klein
had no way to divine if it would be successful ahead of time. He felt
that it would result in him directly dealing with the deity again. So,
he could only recite the rest of the incantation with a strained heart,
“I pray to you,
“I pray for you to give me strength,
“Give me strength to complete the Flaring Sun Charm.
“The blood of the Eternal Blazing Sun, please transfer your strength
into my charm…
“Oh ﬁngered citron, a herb that belongs to the Sun, please bestow
your powers to my charm…”
…
As the incantation neared completion, Klein suddenly felt something
light up before him.
The simple gold badge radiated with an intense light, as though the
sun had descended onto the land.
Klein suddenly found himself enveloped in extreme heat. His hair
was heating up rapidly and was almost on the brink of igniting.
His feet felt like they were stepping barefoot on yellow sand that had
been exposed to the midday sun, and his face and body were greeted
with the hot wind blowing from every direction.
In that instance, he felt that he needed to do something to let the
burning energies out. Otherwise, he would turn into a human candle.
It required almost zero thought as Klein lifted both his hands. While
his thoughts were boiling over like porridge, he relied on the
combination of his spirituality and the strong winds, as well as his
instincts and ritualistic guidance, to begin etching symbols,
corresponding Path Numbers, magical characteristics, and ancient
incantations onto both sides of the gold slices with his carving knife.
Outside the church, Leonard was standing in the shadows to hide
from coming into contact with direct sunlight.
Suddenly, the sunlight intensiﬁed, like the hottest days of a year in
early July.
He squinted his eyes and looked towards the sky. He saw that the
blue sky had no clouds or dust. It was so pure that it made people
gasp with admiration.
“Such strange weather.” Beside him, Kenley also noticed the changes
in the sunlight.
Leonard responded with a smile when he suddenly turned his head.
He knitted his eyebrows slightly and cast his gaze towards the
cathedral.
“Luckily Rozanne isn’t here. Otherwise, she would be complaining
about the sun tanning her skin,” Leonard looked away and said with
a smile.
The blazing sunlight remained intense for a few minutes before it
returned to normal.
In the cathedral, Klein’s carving knife ﬁnished the ﬁnal stroke.
As he ﬁnished the magical characteristic that represented light, the
spirituality on both sides of the gold slices suddenly melded together,
as the light converged onto the metal.
No, this is even closer to godhood… Klein was ﬁnally relieved from the
boiling and burning sensations. He examined the two Flaring Sun
Charms in his hands with a clear mind.
The golden luster on the surface of the charms had turned dim, and
the pattern looked ancient yet complex. There was a warm, damp
feeling that seeped into Klein’s skin bit by bit.
“Not bad. I ﬁnally have a more impressive trump card.” Klein sighed
emotionally.
He set the activation incantation for the Flaring Sun Charms as the
word “light” in Ancient Hermes.
I want light and there will be light… He quipped, amused. Then, he put
the Flaring Sun Charms into another pocket. He didn’t put them with
the Slumber, Requiem, and Dream Charms, because the Flaring Sun
Charms would decrease their eﬃcacy period.
“Yes, the power of the Flaring Sun Charms can be maintained for at
least a year, or even longer.” Klein reined his thoughts back and
looked at the Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem on the ground.
It didn’t look any diﬀerent on the surface, and it still gave oﬀ feelings
of warmth and purity. Klein ﬁnally relaxed, and quickly completed
the ritual and removed the spiritual wall.
At that point, he thought to examine himself. He realized that his
clothes were almost drenched, and he was covered in sweat. The
edges of his hair were slightly curly too.
Thankfully, thankfully… Klein sighed in satisfaction. He put away his
things and returned to his original seat. He was so exhausted that he
slept the moment he sat down, until he was woken up by footsteps.
His eyes shot open, and he touched the Flaring Sun Charms
subconsciously to see if they were still there.
“You don’t look alright?” Leonard asked as he entered the cathedral.
Klein massaged his temples, stood up, and smiled.
“I’m nearing my limit.”
He took out his silver pocket watch and took a glance. “Just in time.
It’s your turn to look after Sealed Artifact 3-0782.”
Before he ﬁnished speaking, Klein took oﬀ the Mutated Sun Sacred
Emblem and passed it to Leonard.
Leonard watched Klein walk out of the cathedral. Then, he dropped
his frivolous attitude and examined Sealed Artifact 3-0782 attentively
and seriously. He grew confused and looked bewildered.
After the shifts ended, the three Nighthawks began their journey
back.
Before that, they told Priest Siur to take note of the town’s situation.
If there were any paranormal incidents, he was to immediately send a
telegram to Saint Selena Cathedral.
At twenty minutes past seven that night, they ﬁnally arrived at
Zouteland Street and returned Sealed Artifact 3-0782.
When he had made sure that the Captain didn’t notice anything
unusual, Klein left the Blackthorn Security Company and arrived
home before eight.
He took out his keys and opened the door, only to see an unknown
ﬁgure.
It was obviously a maiden who wasn’t even in her twenties. She was
in an old, grayish-white dress, and she was wiping the dining hall
with all her might.
She had black hair and brown eyes. Her eyes were small, her nose
wasn’t sharp enough, and her facial features were very ordinary.
Who is this? Klein was stunned at ﬁrst, then he realized that she was
most likely the maidservant that had come for a trial.
At that moment, Benson lowered his newspaper and looked at his
brother. He smiled and said, “A company that doesn’t allow
employees to leave the oﬃce on time is annoying.”
“But it provides a salary that can counteract any kind of
dissatisfaction,” Klein replied with a laugh.
When Miss Justice’s 300 pounds reach me, I’ll inform Benson and Melissa
about my raise to six pounds a week, that way they would worry less
about our family’s ﬁnances… Klein thought as he put his cane aside
and took oﬀ his top hat. He walked to the living hall and lowered his
voice as he asked, “Have you made a choice?”
He had divined the information of the three maidservants the day
before, and he had found that all three were suitable. Hence, the
decision was left to his brother and sister.
“Yes, Bella. Weekly salary of ﬁve soli. She’s very willing and also
capable of learning cooking. She hopes that she can become a home
chef, at which point her weekly pay will double. Her father is a
factory worker at the Tingen Steelworks Union Factory, and her
mother is a laundry worker,” Benson replied with a chuckle. “Of
course, another thing that led Melissa and me to the decision is that
the other two servants believe in the Lord of Storms, and she is a
believer of the Goddess. I personally don’t mind the believers of the
Lord of Storms, but Melissa didn’t quite like the idea.”
It wasn’t that Melissa didn’t like it, a more accurate description would be
“I grieve at their misfortune and am infuriated at their refusal to resist.”
Yes, it was said by Lu Xun! Klein recalled his sister’s behavior, and
revealed a smile.
Benson didn’t elaborate further. He put down the newspaper and
stood up.
“Since you’re back, let’s have dinner.”
…
The next day, Klein entered the Blackthorn Security Company in a
good mood.
“Good morning.” Rozanne looked to the left and then the right. Then,
she said, “Old Neil is sick, let’s go and visit him at noon. What say
you?”
“Old Neil is sick?” Klein asked in surprise.
Could it be that the ritual for treating diarrhea caused severe constipation?
Well, from the way he acted after learning of the “acting method,” it’s not
impossible for him to suddenly fall sick… He’s getting old, so once his
mind turns frail, his body would also suﬀer from those ramiﬁcations…
Rozanne nodded and said, “Yeah, he sent someone to the Captain to
request some time oﬀ.”
Klein nodded slightly. “Let’s visit him at noon. Sigh, Old Neil sure is
pitiful. His wife passed away early, and his son is busy in some other
city. When he’s sick, all he can do is stay at home in loneliness and
helplessness.”
That was the ﬁrst thing he recalled from his ﬁrst visit to Old Neil’s
house.
Listening to Klein’s sigh, Rozanne opened her eyes wide and asked in
shock, “When did Old Neil get married?”
Chapter 163: Various Signs
What? Klein was left dumbfounded when he heard Rozanne’s
question. He recalled in his daze, “I previously visited Old Neil’s
place just last month. I saw a piano in the living room and he told me
that his deceased wife loved music…”
As he spoke, Klein suddenly became alarmed as he began having
unpleasant thoughts.
Rozanne knitted her beautiful brows and said with uncertainty,
“Perhaps I remembered wrong… No, Mrs. Orianna and I frequented
Old Neil’s place during the earlier half of the year. There was no
piano in his living room back then. I clearly remember asking him
why he chose to remain single. His answer was that he hasn’t met a
lady that he wished to marry…”
There was no piano during the earlier half of the year, and he answered
the question of why he chose to remain single… Klein tightened up and
asked in a deep voice, “Rozanne, how long has it been since you
visited Old Neil’s place?”
“Not ever since Kenley became a Nighthawk, and Viola chose to
resign as a clerk. I’ve been either burning the midnight oil or
catching up on sleep, so how could I have the time to visit him? It’s
been… since the beginning of June.” Rozanne became a little lost
upon receiving the question, so all she did was answer honestly.
Klein’s heart sank, as if he sensed something was wrong.
He ﬁshed out a halfpence from his pocket and held it between his
thumb and middle ﬁnger.
He took a deep breath and quickly decided on a divination statement.
“There’s something wrong with Old Neil’s current situation.
“There’s something wrong with Old Neil’s current situation.”
…
His pupils quickly darkened as he recited the statement silently and
entered Cogitation.
Ding!
He ﬂicked his thumb, pushing the brass coin into the air and allowing
it to spin.
Pak! The coin fell right into Klein’s open palm.
This time, the portrait of George III was facing up.
The portrait signiﬁed that it was correct, that it was positive.
That meant that there really was something wrong with Old Neil’s
current situation!
As Klein clenched the coin, he suddenly remembered the translucent
pair of cold and ruthless eyes without any brows that he had seen
behind Old Neil when he had just become a Beyonder and was
experimenting with his Spirit Vision.
Old Neil had explained that the pair of eyes was a characteristic of
ritualistic magic!
That’s right, I also saw an almost formless human ﬁgure by the door at
the periphery of the light. The color of its aura was identical to the
surrounding darkness… Also, after I completely digested the Seer potion, I
secretly changed the way I activated my Spirit Vision to the tapping of my
left molar. I happened to look at Old Neil and he suddenly coughed
violently… Scene after scene appeared in Klein’s mind, turning his
expression grim.
Rozanne looked at him and asked in fear, “Did Old Neil lose control?
No way, even though he’s petty and stingy, and wants to be
reimbursed for all of his expenses, he’s still a good person. He rarely
gets angry. No way, he wouldn’t lose control…”
“I cannot be sure, but I think that Old Neil is on the brink of losing
control.” Klein consoled Rozanne. He quickly made his way past the
partition and opened the door to the Captain’s oﬃce.
Dunn Smith was startled by the sudden intrusion, nearly choking on
his coﬀee.
“What happened?” He didn’t blame Klein, his expression instantly
becoming stern.
Klein answered simply without hiding anything, “Captain, my
divination tells me that there’s something wrong with Old Neil.
“Last month, Old Neil told me that his late wife loved music, but
today, Rozanne told me that he’s remained single all this time.
“Also, on the day that I became a Beyonder, I saw a pair of
mysterious eyes looking over everything behind Old Neil. There was
also an almost transparent human ﬁgure near the door spying on us.
He told me that those were characteristics of ritualistic magic.
“I felt that something was oﬀ and, thus, attempted a divination.”
After Dunn ﬁnished listening intently, he stood up immediately. As
he walked over to to the coat rack, he asked in puzzlement, “Why
didn’t you directly divine if Old Neil had lost control?”
“Over the past month, Old Neil hasn’t acted any diﬀerently from
ordinary Beyonders. He even worked with me to help Swain deal
with a Mandated Punisher who had lost control. I’ve also observed
the colors of his aura from time to time and noticed that he’s
relatively healthy other than his frailty that’s due to his age. Thus, I
think that he’s only close to losing control. He could still be saved,”
Klein explained his point of view in one breath.
Dunn put on his black hat and windbreaker before nodding.
“A very reasonable deduction… Let’s go pay a visit to Old Neil now,
and oh—try not to agitate him if possible.
“After that, we can attempt to control him and use ritualistic magic
to stabilize his condition to prevent it from getting worse.”
Control… Klein had an idea when he heard this term.
“Captain, could we use Sealed Artifact 3-0611?”
He had been thinking about how he could resolve Old Neil’s problem
and save him, but he hadn’t arrived at an answer as he had been too
ﬂustered, too uneasy, and too worried. He was reminded by Dunn
Smith’s words and recalled that the Sealed Artifact might be useful.
“Number: 0611.
“Name: Peaceful Hair Strands.
“Danger Grade: 3. Considerably dangerous. It has to be used
carefully. It can only be applied for operations that require three or
more people.
“Security classiﬁcation: Oﬃcial Nighthawk member or above.
“Sealing Method: No direct contact with living organisms.
“Description: A simple decoration formed with many strands of black
hair.
“As long as contact is made with a living being without any
protection, the living being would lose all their desires and emotions,
including, but not limited to: Hunger, Anger, Grief, Pain, Envy,
Jealousy, Hate, Joy, Satisfaction, Greed, etc.
“It has been ascertained that living beings under 0611’s inﬂuence will
even lose the desire to break contact with it. They will silently stay in
their spot until the end of their life.
“If an external force is used to break contact between the person and
0611, then the person will gradually recover. But experimental data
suggests that the prerequisite to this is that the person has not been
in contact with the Sealed Artifact for more than two hours.
“Once the contact lasts for more than two hours, the victim would
become silent for eternity.
“The highest Sequence tested is Sequence 5.
“You can avoid contact by means such as wearing gloves.
“The strands of hair aren’t equipped with the capability to live. It
doesn’t have any inclinations of escaping the seal.
“Appendix: These strands of hair appeared during a failed
advancement. It was something left behind when a Captain of the
Nighthawks failed to advance to Sequence 6.”
The grayed-eyed Dunn nodded after he heard Klein.
“Great suggestion, I nearly forgot about 3-0611. Find Royale in the
recreation room. I’ll retrieve the Sealed Artifact from Chanis Gate and
submit the application after we come back.”
That’s the way, no time to waste! Klein didn’t dawdle. He immediately
went to the recreation room and shouted for the usually
expressionless Sleepless Royale.
“What’s the mission?” Royale asked calmly.
Klein exhaled and said in a serious tone, “Pay Old Neil a visit.”
“Pay Old Neil a visit… he?” Royale opened her eyes wide as she had
an ominous feeling.
“It’s not conﬁrmed yet.” Klein shook his head gently.
Royale didn’t speak any further. They slipped into silence, turning the
mood heavy.
A few minutes passed, and Dunn ﬁnally returned from the basement.
He was wearing black gloves and had a tangled mess of black hair in
his hand.
Compared to the Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem, the Peaceful Hair
Strands didn’t look particularly weird. It would be glossed over by
people if it were tossed on the road somewhere.
After calling for the chauﬀeur Cesare, the four of them made their
way to Old Neil’s house.
The wheels of the carriage rolled across the asphalt road that was wet
from the rain. The carriage interior was more silent than the night.
It was unknown how much time had passed until Dunn sighed.
“Old Neil did have a partner that he was about to be engaged with
when he was younger, but she suddenly became terminally ill. Old
Neil risked divulging the secrets of the Beyonders and tried using
ritualistic magic to save her, but he didn’t succeed. Old Neil back
then was just a beginner in mysticism.
“According to the records, the Nighthawks back then were all on
alert, afraid that Old Neil would lose control because of this. But
luckily, he managed to ﬁnd his sanity and looked normal.”
Let’s hope that this is a false alarm as well… Klein couldn’t help but
draw a crimson moon before his chest and prayed, “May the Goddess
watch over him.”
Dunn and Royale followed suit.
“May the Goddess watch over him.”
…
The sky started to turn brighter as the dark clouds receded. The
Nighthawks arrived in front of Old Neil’s bungalow.
After getting Cesare to drive the carriage far away, Dunn collected
himself and walked towards the main door, cane in one hand and
Sealed Artifact 3-0611 in the other.
Klein pressed down his hat as he and Royale followed behind the
Captain. They made their way past the rose and gold mint garden.
When they reached the door, Klein took a step forward and pulled on
the rope connected to the bell within the building.
Clink! Clang!
A pleasant chime resounded in the house as it broke the heavy
silence.
Clink! Clang! Clink! Clang! Klein pulled several times, then politely
took a step back without making any further attempts.
The three Nighthawks waited patiently for a few minutes, but they
didn’t hear any footsteps approaching the door.
“Perhaps Old Neil went to visit a doctor and isn’t at home.” Klein
forced a smile.
He hadn’t ﬁnished his sentence when a melody came from within the
building. It was the music from a piano. It was like a silent lake
veiled by a thin mist beneath the moonlight.
Dunn’s expression became abnormally stern and grave. Klein’s heart
sank as well.
Just as he was about to do another divination, he suddenly saw liquid
ﬂowing out from the gap beneath the door.
The stream of liquid was transparent and pure at ﬁrst, before it
became dyed crimson, a crimson similar to that of blood. It was an
intensely dark crimson red.
Chapter 164: Miserable
Wretches
The color of fresh blood was reﬂected in Klein’s eyes as they intently
locked onto the ﬂowing liquid.
Just then, there was a light cough from within the house. Old Neil
spoke with a raspy voice, “Dunn, why are you here?”
Dunn’s gray eyes were extremely deep. His mellow voice replied
calmly, “I heard that you’re sick, so we came to visit.”
There was a sudden silence in the house. A few seconds later, Old
Neil roared in anger and terror, “No! You’re lying!”
Without waiting for Klein and company to say a word, his tone
suddenly became weak.
“Yes, I know my condition isn’t quite right.”
Old Neil… Klein closed his eyes, but the bloody liquid that was
seeping through the gap of the door didn’t cease.
Then, Old Neil raised his voice and said, “All this time, I’ve never
hurt anyone, nor have I thought of hurting anyone! I never—I never
betrayed the secrets of the Nighthawks, one even one! At the most—
at the most, I’ve made claims for undeserving expenses. I really
haven’t committed any evil!”
“Klein!” He suddenly shouted like he usually did. “I told you about
the maxim of the Mystery Pryers, ‘Do as you wish, but do no harm.’ I
still live by this saying. I’d rather be patient—I’d rather endure than
do things that will harm others…”
With that said, he pleaded sincerely, in fear, “Dunn, Royale, Klein, go
back. Go back. Wait till tomorrow—by tomorrow, I’ll be back to
normal. I swear—I swear to the Goddess, I wouldn’t harm anyone.
Really!”
Dunn closed his eyes and asked extremely gently, “What do you plan
on doing? What have you been trying to do all this while?”
“Me?” Old Neil was confused at ﬁrst before he described with a tone
ﬁlled with hope, “I’m trying to resurrect Celeste. Dunn, I found a
way, I’m on the right track!
“You should have heard about it. Back then, I made a mistake during
the ritualistic magic to treat her illness, so I failed. I failed to save
her. I now know it was because I had yet to master mysticism. But
now, I now have enough knowledge and experience to complete
everything! It’s regrettable that I wasn’t inspired by the maxim of the
Mystery Pryers and Daly’s example. I missed the best opportunity. If-
if I was a High-Sequence Beyonder, all of this would become
extremely easy.” As he spoke, Old Neil’s voice sounded tearful, “No, I
cannot give up again… Dunn, go back. Go back, please. I beg of you.”
Klein clenched his teeth as he heard the Captain ask emotionally,
“How do you plan on resurrecting Celeste?”
Old Neil instantly became very excited.
“I’ll use the ‘Alchemical Life’ method to create an immortal body for
her. Dunn, you might not know of it, but Sequence 4 Beyonders from
the Church of Mother Earth are good at this. The corresponding
Sequence in the Savant pathway can barely do it as well. Yes, I will
complete it with the aid of God’s favor.
“Then, I’ll summon her spirit from the spirit world and pray for God’s
help to combine her spirit and body together.
“Isn’t it a great idea?”
Dunn lifted the corner of his lips forcefully and said, “Yes, it’s a great
idea. Old Neil, let us in. Perhaps we can help you.”
“… Dunn, are you still not willing to let me oﬀ the hook?” Old Neil
pleaded, “Go back, just go back. I’ll return to normal tomorrow,
really. Dunn, I swear I’ll never steal your coﬀee beans again. Klein,
Royale, I swear I won’t make you help me with my undeserved
claims! Really!”
In Klein’s and Royale’s blurry vision, Dunn lowered his head before
lifting it up again. “Old Neil, you’re misunderstanding. We’re here to
visit you. You are our teammate. You’re sick, and you aren’t well. We
deﬁnitely needed to visit you. Open the door. Let us see you, so that
we can be certain. If you’re really okay, we’ll return immediately. As
you know, there are especially many missions recently. We have to
monitor the asylum while we take care of various other sudden
incidents.”
Old Neil hesitated for a moment before saying, “There’s really
nothing serious about my condition, really. I’ll recover by tomorrow.”
The bloody water that ﬂowed out through the gap under the door
went down the stairs, towards the stone path, and onto the garden’s
soil.
“Old Neil, we’ve known each other for about ﬁfteen years now, right?
We’ve worked on countless missions together. I’m really concerned
and worried for you. I have to see you with my own eyes before I’ll
be at ease,” Dunn said gently.
“… Alright,” Old Neil pouted. “There’s really nothing wrong with
me.”
With a creak, the door opened slowly. Klein quickly wiped his eyes
and allowed his sight to return to normal.
Then, he saw that the carpet in the lobby was red and sticky, covered
in blood and hair.
He looked forward and up, only to realize that the living room’s
ﬂoor, ceiling, round table, piano, and chairs were all covered in the
same disgusting, sticky and hairy liquid.
Old Neil’s head hung in the air, connected to the ceiling by a thick
liquid. His forehead and cheeks each had a pair of eyes. They were
cold and ruthless eyes with no eyelashes.
The piano’s keys were dancing on their own, playing a melodious
tune.
“Dunn, look. I’m really okay,” Old Neil said with a radiant smile.
“Royale, Klein, you think so too, right?”
The moment he opened his mouth, Klein saw the same thick, hairy,
and bloody liquid ﬂowing inside it.
Dunn’s gray eyes shimmered as he chatted like everything was
normal.
“Old Neil, where did you learn the Alchemical Life and resurrection
ritual from?”
Old Neil replied excitedly, “I heard it. I tried the ﬁrst part, and
conﬁrmed its authenticity! It’s a gift from God! He kept describing it
in my ears. He kept describing, He is—He is…”
Old Neil’s voice came to a halt. More than ten seconds later, he
continued in fear and in apparent loss, “He is the Hidden Sage…”
The Hidden Sage? Isn’t that the non-anthropomorphic god that the
Moses Ascetic Order believes in? The god that was resurrected,
bringing about evil and corruption… The Moses Ascetic Order has
the complete Mystery Pryer Sequence… Klein’s heart stirred as many
thoughts came to him.
Upon mentioning the Hidden Sage, Old Neil seemed to ﬁnally
awaken. He looked around vacantly and observed everything.
In the indescribable silence, his six eyes looked towards Dunn, and he
said with a bitter smile, “So it turns out—it turns out that I’ve already
become a monster…”
Without waiting for Dunn and the others to reply, Old Neil suddenly
revealed a smile, one of groveling, fear, and cowardice.
“Let me go. I’ll go deep into the mountains and won’t appear again.
I’ll never harm anyone. I’ll only attempt my ritual quietly, really. Let
me go, please. I beg of you.”
Just then, Klein felt something illusory shatter before his eyes.
Then, Old Neil’s four cold-looking lashless eyes ﬂashed with a dark
glow and locked onto Dunn. His expression suddenly turned cold.
“You’re pulling me into a dream!
“No, it’s useless! My eyes can see through all of that!”
The sticky blood that covered the ceiling, ﬂoor, and walls started
squirming, like a giant opening its mouth to swallow Klein and
company. Old Neil’s head grew blurry like overlapping afterimages.
Klein didn’t fumble for his revolver; instead, he extended his hand
into his pocket and planned to use his Slumber Charm.
Suddenly, everything calmed down before him. The sticky, bloody
liquid suddenly turned placid like a still lake.
Old Neil lost his coldness, hatred, desire, and all other expressions.
He became quiet and peaceful.
It was unknown when Dunn had thrown Sealed Artifact 3-0611 into
the blood.
The four lashless eyes on Old Neil’s forehead and cheeks slowly
closed, seemingly having lost the desire to keep them open.
Any living creature that came into contact with the Peaceful Hair
Strands would turn peaceful and lose all motivation until the end of
their life.
Dunn, Klein, and Royale drew their guns at the same time and aimed
at Old Neil’s head.
Then, Old Neil revealed a look of extreme fear. He was struggling, his
strong desire to live fought against the eﬀects of Sealed Artifact
3-0611.
The four extra eyes disappeared. The wrinkles at the corners of his
eyes and mouth were still deep, his hair was still white, his crimson
eyes were still turbid, just like when Klein had ﬁrst met him.
“Dunn, do you remember the time I saved you…
“Royale, do you remember when I helped you redeem your family’s
lives…
“Klein, do you remember how I taught you mysticism every day? Do
you remember when we talked about how to make claims? Do you
remember how I made you hand-ground coﬀee? Do you remember
when we fought against a Mandated Punisher Rampager?”
…
The illusory pleading echoed in Klein’s ears, and his right hand that
was holding the revolver trembled. He found it diﬃcult to pull the
trigger.
Bang! Bang!
The two silver demon hunting bullets ﬂew out and penetrated Old
Neil’s head one after another.
Klein watched as the familiar, abnormal face revealed a hopeless
expression. He saw the man’s skull tear open, the red and white
within spurting in all directions.
The sticky blood that coated their surroundings started shrinking as it
ﬂowed back into Old Neil’s broken head that had fallen to the
ground. Dunn and Royale lowered their guns simultaneously, and all
was silent.
Klein looked at everything before him—Old Neil’s “corpse” was
becoming a ball of rotten ﬂesh. He saw that there was a pair of eyes,
crimson and crystal clear, yet incredibly pained amidst the blood and
ﬂesh.
He felt like everything that had happened was just a dream and
found it impossible to bring himself into believing the sequence of
events and how it had ended.
He stood dumbfounded as he saw Dunn take two steps forward, his
ﬁgure stooped.
Dunn looked at Old Neil’s “corpse” and muttered heavily, “We are
guardians, but also a bunch of miserable wretches that are constantly
ﬁghting against threats and madness.”
Chapter 165: Epitaph
“We are guardians, but also a bunch of miserable wretches that are
constantly ﬁghting against threats and madness.”
Dunn’s words echoed throughout Old Neil’s house. They reverberated
across the corroded ﬂoor, the walls, and ceiling, as well as within
Klein’s mind and soul.
He’d never had a stronger impression of that sentence than the one
he had now.
He felt that he wouldn’t forget this feeling for as long as he lived,
even if he were to return to Earth.
Amidst the still atmosphere, Dunn walked towards Old Neil’s
“corpse” and kneeled down. He took out a white handkerchief from
the pocket of his windbreaker and covered it over the dark red,
crystalline eyeball which looked pained.
At this moment, Klein noticed that the keys of the piano had stopped
moving. A faint, translucent ﬁgure appeared.
This… Klein, who had activated his Spirit Vision before entering the
house, froze.
He hadn’t noticed this strange “soul” until now!
Was it because he was distracted by Old Neil, or was it due to Old
Neil’s abilities after he lost control? Klein saw the formless ﬁgure
evaporate quickly, vanishing before his very eyes. He had a faint idea
of what was going on.
Suppressing the heavy feeling in his heart, he heard the Captain
order, “Search Old Neil’s house carefully for possible clues.”
“Alright.” When Klein spoke, it took him a minute to recognize his
own voice. His voice was raspy and deep, as if he had the ﬂu.
“Alright,” Royale also replied.
The condition of her voice is about the same as mine… It’s like our
nostrils are blocked… Klein looked at his female teammate, who
typically didn’t have much of an expression. It was as if he was
knowing her for the ﬁrst time.
Placing his cane on an umbrella rack near the door, he made his way
around Sealed Artifact 3-0611. He took heavy steps into the living
room and up to the second ﬂoor. He then searched every room for
possible clues.
Old Neil employed someone to clean the rooms regularly, so the
rooms weren’t as messy as one would expect of a bachelor.
Everything was in order, as if there was a female presence in the
house.
Half an hour later, Klein found a few handwritten notes on a
bookshelf in Old Neil’s room. The notes recorded a weird, mysterious
ritual:
“Alchemical Life.
“The materials required include: 100ml of spring water from the
Spring of Elves (Golden Spring on Sonia Island), 50 grams of Star
Crystal, half a pound of pure gold, 5 grams of phlogiston, 30 grams of
red iron… And a large quantity of fresh blood from living people.”
Old Neil annotated beneath the part about fresh blood from the
living.
“I can consider drawing my own blood, accumulating it little by little
and preserve it using ritualistic magic.”
I can consider drawing my own… Klein closed his eyes and crushed
the notes.
…
On Thursday morning at nine, the time of the moon. Raphael
Cemetery.
Klein was wearing his black formal suit and holding onto his cane. He
stood silently in a corner of the cemetery.
He had stuﬀed a neat white handkerchief in his breast pocket and
was holding onto a Slumber ﬂower.
Dunn, Frye, Leonard, and Kenley were carrying a black coﬃn that
stored Old Neil’s corpse. They slowly walked to the front of the
tombstone and silently lowered it into the grave.
As she saw the brown soil being tossed into the grave, Rozanne, who
was wearing a black dress and a white ﬂower in her hair, wept.
“Can someone tell me if this is all happening for real?
“Why did he lose control, why did he consume the potion, why did
he become a Beyonder, why must there be wraiths and monsters,
why is there no safer way? Why, why, why…”
Klein silently listened on until Old Neil’s coﬃn was completely
buried in the soil, until all signs that he existed were buried deep
within the earth.
“May the Goddess bless you.” He drew a crimson moon in front of his
chest, then took a few steps forward and placed the Slumber ﬂower
in front of the tomb.
“May the Goddess bless you.” Dunn, Frye, and the others tapped at
their chests in a clockwise fashion.
Klein looked up, straightened his back, and saw the black and white
photograph on the tombstone.
Old Neil was wearing his classic black hat; his white hair was peeking
out around the edges. The wrinkles beside his eyes and mouth were
deep, his dark red eyes a little turbid.
He was so peaceful, no longer feeling grief, pain, or fear.
There was an epitaph carved underneath the photograph. It came
from the contents of the last entry in Old Neil’s diary: “If I cannot
save her, then I shall accompany her.”
The morning breeze blew gently. The silence and emptiness of the
Raphael Cemetery hung over everyone.
…
In the afternoon, Klein took a form signed by the Captain to the
armory.
He opened the half-closed door and saw Bredt with a thick, black
beard behind the table.
Klein froze visibly before handing the form over.
“Fifty rounds of ordinary bullets.”
During his request, he glanced at the tin can on the table. He felt as
though he could smell the fragrance of the hand-ground coﬀee and
hear the cheeky words in his ears, “But why must you wait till you
have spare cash? You can apply to Dunn and get him to approve of
the expenses!”
…
Bredt noticed Klein’s expression and sighed.
“I can understand what you’re feeling right now. I, myself, cannot
believe that Old Neil would leave us like that. Sometimes, I even feel
as though this is a dream conjured by the Captain.”
“Perhaps this is the destiny of many Nighthawks,” Klein replied with
a bitter smile.
After this incident, he felt much more disappointment and hatred
toward the upper echelons of the Church for keeping the “acting
method” a secret.
“Let’s hope that there will be fewer such tragedies, may the Goddess
bless us.” Bredt drew a crimson moon in front of his chest. He took
the application form and walked into the armory.
…
Bang! Bang! Bang!
The smell of gunpowder ﬁlled the air. Klein vented his frustrations
onto the target he was shooting at, until he ﬁnished shooting the
bullets that he had requested. He then collected himself and took a
public carriage to Gawain’s house.
He completed sets upon sets of exercises, as if he was torturing
himself, until Gawain told him to stop.
“Combat practice isn’t there for you to harm yourself.” Gawain
looked at Klein with his turbid green eyes.
“I’m sorry, Teacher. I’m a little down today.” Klein exhaled and
attempted to explain.
“What happened?” Gawain asked without a ripple of emotion.
Klein thought for a moment, then gave a simple reply, “A friend of
mine passed away suddenly.”
Gawain was silent for a few seconds. He stroked his blond mustache
and said with a ﬂeeting voice, “I once lost 325 friends in the span of
ﬁve minutes, amongst them were 10 that I could trust with my life.”
Klein sighed in realization. “That is the cruelty of war.”
Gawain shot a glance at him and let out a self-deprecating laugh.
“The cruelest thing of all is the fact that I can never exact revenge for
them. I can never fulﬁll their dreams, and the answer eludes me
forever.
“As for you, you still have such a chance. Even though I don’t exactly
know what happened, I know that you’re still young. You still have
many opportunities.”
Klein was silent for a moment. He took in a breath and collected
himself.
“Thank you, Teacher.”
Gawain nodded and said without any expression, “Take a ten-minute
break, then do ten more sets of the exercises you were doing just
now.”
“…” Klein was momentarily unsure what expression he should show.
…
Friday morning, in the recreation room of the Nighthawks.
Klein, Seeka Tron, and Frye were seated around the round table, but
they weren’t playing cards. One of them was ﬂipping through
newspapers, the other was looking out the oriel windows in a daze,
and the last was holding onto a pen, wanting to write something but
failing to do so.
The room was quiet. No one spoke, and no one joked around. The
atmosphere was heavy.
Phew… Klein exhaled. He lowered his newspaper and planned to
focus on reading the materials he had found.
At that moment, Dunn Smith knocked and entered the room. He
looked around before saying, “Klein, come out for a moment.”
What happened? Klein, who had a premonition of what was
happening, stood up and made his way out of the recreation room.
Dunn stood at the entrance of the stairway leading to the basement.
He turned and looked at Klein.
“The person that the Holy Cathedral sent is here.”
The person examining me is here? Klein’s nerves tensed.
Chapter 166: Examination
There was a cold breeze blowing from the basement, providing a hint
of relief for Klein’s tense emotions.
It’s ﬁnally here.
Once I pass this stage, I won’t have to worry about being examined like
this for at least half a year…
Once I advance to Sequence 8 and become a so-called “Clown,” I’ll
possess actual combat strength. With the aid of divination and my Flaring
Sun Charms for backup, I’ll have a chance of surviving even more
relatively dangerous situations…
Since I was waiting for the Holy Cathedral’s examination, I haven’t even
dared to withdraw the three hundred pounds that Miss Justice transferred
to the anonymous account. Just in case they audit my ﬁnancial situation
and ﬁnd out that I’m in possession of a large sum of money from an
unknown source…
…
Just as Klein’s thoughts ﬂashed through his mind uncontrollably,
Dunn Smith smoothed his sleeve and said in a low voice, “The person
in charge of the examination is one of the nine high-ranking deacons
of the Nighthawks, Crestet Cesimir. The Holy Cathedral attaches
great importance to you.”
“A high-ranking deacon?” Klein blurted in surprise.
In general terms, the thirteen archbishops and nine high-ranking
deacons made up the upper echelons of the church. It was said that
there was no lack of High-Sequence Beyonders among them!
The twenty-two ladies and gentlemen were all equal in terms of their
rankings. They only followed the orders of the Evernight Goddess,
and they were only answerable to the Pope.
Dunn took a whiﬀ of the cold wind from the basement before
nodding faintly.
“Yes, he’s a high-ranking deacon. But you don’t have to be nervous.
Crestet is only a Sequence 5, and has yet to enter a demigod state. So,
you don’t have to be too afraid or reverent.
“Oh, his title in the Beyonder world is the ‘Goddess’s Sword.’ As he
possesses a holy item, his combat strength is similar to a newly
advanced Sequence 4 Beyonder.
“I just chatted with him. He was very friendly.”
If I read between the lines, Captain is telling me that he only said what
was necessary. He doesn’t want me to be nervous and go according to the
plan… Klein nodded thoughtfully and asked, “Where should I met the
high-ranking deacon?”
“The alchemy room where we concoct potions,” Dunn replied simply,
as a hint of gloominess ﬂashed across his face.
The alchemy room where we concoct potions? The laboratory where Old
Neil made my Seer potion? Klein slowly let out a breath and returned
to the Nighthawks recreation room and took his outerwear from the
clothes rack.
He put on the black windbreaker, placed his hands into his pockets,
and walked down the winding stairs that connected to the basement.
Then, he took a left turn at the cross junction.
Very quickly, Klein saw a secret door under the light of the elegant
gas lamps that lined the walls. He saw that the long tables in the
room had been moved aside to open up a large space in the center of
the room.
There were two classic high back chairs facing each other with less
than a meter in-between them.
There was a man in his thirties wearing a black windbreaker and a
white shirt seated on the chair that was facing the door.
His golden-brown hair was cut very short, and his blackish-green
eyes were as dark as a forest on a moonless night. The collars of his
shirt and windbreaker were put up, and his entire chin was hidden
within the shadows.
“Hello, Your Grace.” Klein bowed.
Crestet Cesimir had his right leg crossed over his left as he leisurely
leaned back into his chair. He smiled and replied, “Hello, Klein. You
may sit over there.”
He pointed at the high back chair opposite him.
By the side of his leg was a suitcase made of silver. It was about the
size of a violin case.
It can carry a sword with an appropriate length… Klein walked forward
and sat at his appointed seat.
Crestet rested his right index ﬁnger on his upper lip as he thought for
a few seconds.
“I plan to ﬁrst examine how well you’ve mastered your potion. That’s
not a problem, right?”
“Not at all.” Klein shook his head with utmost conﬁdence.
“Very conﬁdent.” Crestet smiled, but maintained his previous
posture. All he did was intently watch Klein.
Klein suddenly felt the light from the surrounding gas lamps vanish,
as though they were swallowed by the rich darkness.
He suddenly became exhausted, as though his biological clock had
struck the time for sleep.
But, his mind was extremely tense, making it impossible to relax. It
was just like when he was unable to sleep peacefully due to over-
exhaustion.
The silent “night” ﬁlled his surroundings as Klein heard the noise of
dripping water from a tap that wasn’t closed properly. Then, he heard
the conversations in the Blackthorn Security Company and the
movement of the wind blowing through the stairway.
Besides that, he didn’t see anything that he shouldn’t see, nor did he
hear any noises that he shouldn’t be able to hear.
“Excellent.” Crestet’s hypnotic voice dispersed the darkness, and the
light from the gas lamps inside and outside the alchemy room came
into Klein’s sight again.
Klein suddenly shook oﬀ his exhaustion and returned to his previous
energetic self.
He aﬀected me without me realizing it… Is that what a Sequence 5
Beyonder is capable of? This is the horror of a high-ranking deacon? He
recalled what had happened and felt a little frightened.
Crestet Cesimir clasped his hands and put them on his knees. He bent
down slightly, and his lips were blocked by his collar.
“You passed the test. You achieved a level beyond outstanding in
your mastery of your potion.
“I’ll need to observe to see if there are any hidden dangers in your
mind, to make sure that the potion’s remaining spirit hasn’t changed
your character subconsciously or left some problems behind.
“You have three minutes to prepare.”
Klein immediately nodded and said, “Alright.”
He secretly took a breath and allowed himself to enter Cogitation to
remove various negative thoughts.
Crestet didn’t speak again. He took out a silver pocket watch from the
inner pocket of his black windbreaker and ﬂipped it open.
Then, he attentively watched the second hand move.
Three minutes later, Crestet closed his pocket watch and said with a
smile, “I’ll begin singing.”
Singing? Klein wore a look of confusion.
Before Klein could reply, Crestet started humming a lovely melody.
The melody reverberated in the alchemy room and gradually lost its
harmony and went out of tune.
Squeak! Scratch! Zing! Klein heard the noise akin to the scratching of
blackboards with nails, the sound of bubble wrap rubbing against
each other, electric drills drilling, and various other annoying noises.
The noises intensiﬁed and turned more and more chaotic. They made
him want to vent his frustrations and cause destruction.
But Klein, who frequently experienced the mad ravings and terrifying
screams, restrained his urges very quickly.
He displayed annoyance, tension, frustration, and insecurity at
appropriate times.
Being in too perfect of a state would end up being a problem!
It was unknown when Crestet Cesimir had stopped singing. The
noises in the alchemy room disappeared and room the was awash
with tranquility and silence.
Silence sure is great! Klein exclaimed in his head.
“Very good, excellent. There are no latent problems in your soul. Of
course, if you wanted to beat me up or stuﬀ my mouth with
something, that’s only normal.” Crestet’s mouth was blocked by his
collar so Klein could only determine his emotions through his tone.
“No, I wouldn’t dare,” Klein admitted honestly.
Crestet smiled and said, “Congratulations, you have passed all the
tests. Now it’s time for the question and answer session.”
His green eyes suddenly darkened. His gaze was deep, as though he
could see through ﬂesh, and looked directly at the spirit.
“Go ahead,” Klein replied, sitting straight.
Crestet maintained his earlier posture and casually asked, “You said
that your experience in the Divination Club allowed you to quickly
master the potion?”
“Yes,” Klein answered frankly but didn’t describe further.
Crestet nodded slightly and said, “And you said that your inspiration
came from the maxim of the Mystery Pryers and also Daly’s
example?”
“Yes.” Klein conﬁrmed this ﬁrst before explaining in detail, “I found
out from one of my teammates who was a Mystery Pryer that those
who abide by the maxim of the Mystery Pryers have a lower
probability of losing control than normal. After that, I heard that
Madam Daly once said that she wanted to be a real Spirit Medium,
and that she is a genius that leveled up to Sequence 7 within two
years.
“After noticing both situations, I thought I could give it a try, I
attempted to be a real Seer and outlined some principles for a Seer.
The outcome was better than I expected. I mastered the potion very
quickly. Your Grace, I’m not sure if you have had a similar
experience. When I fully mastered the potion, there was a very
special, very magical feeling…” Klein described his experience as if
he only vaguely understood the “acting method.”
The man he had been when he was on earth would’ve been nervous
and embarrassed to speak so many half-lies before such a powerful
Nighthawk. But ever since he transmigrated to the current world, he
had lied so much that he was used to it. He could do it ﬂawlessly.
The darkness in Crestet’s eyes disappeared, and his gaze returned to
normal. He smiled and said, “Don’t worry, it’s not an illusion.”
From his answer, Klein couldn’t see any doubt or scrutiny, so he felt
at ease.
“Dunn endorsed your experience. I believe that you really are a
genius, with a logical mind and sharp senses,” Crestet complimented.
He then asked, “Did you share your experience with your
teammates?”
“Of course,” Klein admitted frankly. “I hope that I can help them
lower the risk of losing control. We’re teammates, comrades that face
danger together. I don’t have any reason to hide the truth. But for the
same reason, I didn’t tell the clerks.”
Crestet uncrossed his right leg and sat up straight. His thin lips were
exposed from the shadow of his collar.
He lifted the corner of his lips and said, “Although you haven’t even
been with the Nighthawks for two months, I believe your
understanding towards partners is much better than many others.
“Hmm, I plan to share more information with you, but according to
the Holy Cathedral’s rules, you have to swear to the Goddess that you
won’t reveal the contents of our conversation to anyone that doesn’t
know about this.
“That should be ﬁne, right?”
I passed the test? Klein was delighted. He nodded without hesitation.
“No problem!”
Although I won’t be able to teach others the “acting method,” I can let
Miss Justice and Mr. Hanged Man do so indirectly!
Chapter 167: Holy Artifact
“Alright.” Crestet Cesimir nodded. He leaned forward. “Then swear
upon the Holy Artifact.”
As he was saying this, he bent down to lift the silver suitcase by his
foot.
Holy Artifact? The Holy Artifact that earned you the title of the
Goddess’s Sword?Klein looked at the actions of the deacon curiously.
Crestet placed the suitcase on his knees, his dark green eyes instantly
turning black.
He lifted his hand then pressed down. The cover of the silver suitcase
which resembled a violin case suddenly dissolved and receded like
the tide.
At the same time, Klein felt that the light around him was being
drawn forward as if it was being absorbed by the suitcase.
Apart from the lights from the classic lamps that lined the walls, as
well as the silver splendor that spiraled within the suitcase, the
alchemy room turned pitch dark. The scene looked extremely strange.
Pa!
WIth a crisp snapping sound, Crestet Cesimir opened the suitcase,
revealing the pure white bone sword that lay within.
Yes, a bone sword. The moment Klein saw the sword, he knew
instinctively that it was mainly made out of bone!
The short sword silently released a pure white glow in the pitch dark
alchemy room, as if it were a moon hanging high in the night sky, or
a lighthouse in the middle of a storm.
It looked as though the sword had no defects on its surface, but a
closer examination would reveal that the surface of the sword was
laced with layers of symbols and icons. These mysterious patterns
intertwined to form the body of the sword.
Klein observed the holy sword, suddenly realizing that he couldn’t
look away!
His vision was being drawn towards the sword as his brown eyes
slowly lost their luster.
Crestet lifted the suitcase, moving the sword away from its original
position.
Klein instantly snapped out of his trance and ﬁnally freed himself
from the nightmare he couldn’t escape before.
He cast his gaze to the side and asked gravely, “Your Grace, do you
need me to put my hand on the holy sword?”
“Yes, come over.” Crestet’s voice was melodious as if he was singing
a lullaby.
Klein stood up, still looking to the side as he took small steps
forward. As it was dark, he couldn’t see where the legs of the deacon
were, nor his old leather boots.
“Stop,” Crestet spoke calmly.
Klein immediately halted and stood on the spot. He took a quick
glance at the pure white bone sword through the corner of his eyes
before retracting his gaze again, in fear.
With that mere glance, he bent down and extended his right hand,
accurately placing it atop the holy sword.
A cold feeling swept through his skin and into his mind. The
distracting thoughts and feelings of worry instantly eased, as if he
was sitting on a roof in a noisy village, smelling the scent of the
harvest and admiring the starry night sky.
“Recite after me,” Crestet said solemnly.
“Alright.” Klein nodded.
He then heard the deacon speak in Hermes.
“Oh Evernight Goddess, nobler than the stars and more eternal than
eternity.
“I swear to you in my real name and my spirituality.
“I, Klein, will never reveal the details of the ‘acting method’ to those
who do not know of it from this moment forth.
“If I go against this, I shall accept any punishment you deem ﬁt.
“Please witness my oath.”
Klein collected himself and made the oath in Hermes, following
Deacon Cesimir’s lead.
He had the faint feeling that a connection has been established
between him and a faraway being through the pure white bone
sword.
After retracting his right hand, he drew a crimson moon on his chest.
“Praise the Lady!”
“Praise the Lady!” Crestet smiled and bowed in response.
Immediately, he closed the cover of the suitcase and pressed down
heavily with his right hand.
The darkness was instantly lit up as the light from the lamp once
again ﬁlled the entire room.
Klein noticed that the black eyes of Deacon Cesimir had regained
their usual blackish-green.
He made his way back to his chair and frowned. He asked in
puzzlement, “Acting method?”
Crestet cleared his throat. Without answering the question directly,
he instead smiled and said, “You might feel a little confused and not
understand what I’m about to tell you, but I cannot explain why that
is so, for that involves the secrets of the Church.”
You will only have the right to know after you become an archbishop
or a high-ranking deacon… Klein looked at Cesimir and added
inwardly before Cesimir could say it.
“You will only be permitted to know after you become a core
member of the Church, such as an archbishop or a high-ranking
deacon,” Crestet emphasized.
Klein nodded sternly.
Crestet placed the silver suitcase back beside his foot and crossed his
legs.
“In the long history of time, the Church has had generations upon
generations of genius Beyonders slowly ﬁguring out a way to avoid
losing control.
“And the core to this method is the name of the potion. It’s not only
critical; it’s also the key.”
After looking at Klein’s thoughtful expression, Crestet continued, “We
have realized that the names of the potions all point to a certain
group, and this group has their own approach and operates in unique
ways. In simpler terms, there are a set of rules that come with the
name of the potion, diﬀerent rules for diﬀerent potions. When we
follow these rules strictly, the risk of losing control is reduced to a
minimum.”
“Similar to my set of Seer principles?” Klein took the opportunity to
ask.
This explanation isn’t as simple or understandable as the one I gave
to Justice and Hanged Man… Klein silently criticized.
“Yes.” Crestet gave an aﬃrmative answer. “When we follow the rules
of the potion, we become more and more like the group described by
the name of the potion. In other words, we are acting as the job that
the name of the potion points us toward. That is the ‘acting method.’
You must remember, the spirituality of every individual is special,
unique. Even though the core rules must be followed by the people
who consume the same potion, there are always certain variations to
the rules that are unique to the individual. Thus, the experiences of
others can only serve as a guide.”
That is a point that I didn’t realize… Klein said sincerely, “Thank you
for informing me. I will remember that.”
Crestet laughed.
“These are the experiences accumulated over the generations.
“After using the ‘acting method,’ we not only gain mastery over the
potion, we’re also digesting it, just as we would our food. When you
truly digest the potion, you will feel a unique, mysterious sensation,
understood?”
“I understand. ‘Digestion,’ this term is very appropriate…” Klein
pretended to be deep in thought.
After Crestet explained the method in more detail, Klein weighed his
words as he asked, “Your Grace, since the name of the potion is not
only the core, but also the key, then how did the ﬁrst Beyonders
obtain them? I heard that it was recorded on the Blasphemy Slate?”
“Yes, that is correct,” Crestet replied frankly. “But the Blasphemy
Slate was inscribed with the ancient names. The names of the potions
which we use today were derived in part from divine revelations.
Some were also consolidated by the experiences of the Beyonders
themselves.”
Klein nodded slowly. He pursed his lips and asked, “Your Grace, since
the ‘acting method’ is so eﬀective, why wouldn’t the Church tell
every Nighthawk about it?”
“I have said that it is a secret of the Church. You will understand the
reason behind it once you become an archbishop or a high-ranking
deacon,” Crestet answered, unfazed. “Alright, return upstairs and tell
the rest of the Nighthawks to come down one at a time. I have to
carry out the ﬁnal step of the examination.”
That’s to keep Frye and the others from divulging the ‘acting
method’? Klein thought as he stood up, he then bade farewell,
following the Nighthawks’ etiquette.
He made his way past the corridor and up the stairs, returning to the
Blackthorn Security Company. He saw Dunn smoking his pipe near
the entrance of the basement.
With a smile, Klein took the initiative to say, “There shouldn’t be any
more problems; His Grace wants me to inform Frye and the others to
head down for a conversation with him.”
“Yes, that is the last step. That means that there were no problems.”
Dunn put away his pipe and headed to the recreation room to tell the
rest.
As he watched Frye and Seeka enter the basement, Klein suddenly
recalled something. He said in a hurry, “Captain, are we going to
have to get Royale who’s guarding over Chanis Gate, and Leonard
who’s watching over the asylum? Oh, and Kenley, who’s on break.”
Dunn froze and pinched his forehead.
“I forgot…”
He paused for a moment, then chortled. “But the matter shouldn’t be
too complicated. One of the advantages of having a high-ranking
deacon examine you is that there’s no need to send a telegraph to the
Holy Cathedral, or engage in a cumbersome exchange of letters. He
can make the decision on the spot and hand the formula to the Clown
potion as well as the main ingredients to you.”
“That’s not too bad.” Klein couldn’t contain his excitement.
…
An hour and a half passed. As Kenley walked out of the alchemy
room, his expression full of puzzlement, Klein was once again called
downstairs. He met the high-ranking deacon once again, the
Goddess’s Sword, Crestet Cesimir, a second time.
This time, the golden-brown-haired and blackish-green-eyed deacon
wasn’t seated. He stood there, allowing the breeze in the basement to
blow at his black windbreaker.
Crestet’s collars stood tall, hiding his chin in the shadows.
He looked at Klein and smiled.
“Nighthawk Klein Moretti, I announce in the name of the Goddess
that you have passed the examination of the Holy Cathedral.
“Congratulations. With your contributions, you can immediately
advance to become a Sequence 8 Beyonder!”
Chapter 168: Clown Potion
Phew, I ﬁnally passed… I passed it just like that…
When Klein heard Crestet Cesimir’s announcement, he let out a
breath of relief despite being mentally prepared for it. It felt surreal,
as though it was a dream.
He had assumed that the examination would be tougher and
lengthier, but when he thought carefully about it, he realized that
what had just happened was what should’ve happened. If he had
taken the normal three years to digest the Seer potion instead of
doing it in a month, the examination wouldn’t have even been
conducted by the Holy Cathedral. The Tingen Nighthawks’ captain
would’ve been responsible for it instead.
I thought they would investigate my family and friends… Hmm,
perhaps Cesimir arrived in Tingen two days ago and completed that
in secret… I also thought that the examination would require me to
complete some task. Heh, I was really overthinking it. The goal of the
examination is merely to determine the level of digestion for the
potion, as well as detect any latent dangers, and see whether I’m
aware of the “acting method” and if I shared my experience with
others… These thoughts ﬂew past Klein’s mind. He ﬂashed a sincere
smile.
“Thank you, Your Grace. Praise the Lady!”
Crestet nodded gently and said, “To advance is to serve the Goddess
better, so that you can protect our fellow believers better. You must
remember this—trust me—it’ll help you ﬁght the temptation of losing
control.”
“Temptation…” Klein ruminated over the word.
Crestet sized Klein up with his green eyes and said sternly, “The
‘acting method’ can help you digest the potion and lower the risk of
losing control, but it’s not the be-all and end-all. To a certain extent,
you can even confuse playing the role and your own existence. You
know, there are many actors in the theater that develop severe
psychological issues. At a certain level, you might really go insane.”
Remember that you’re only acting… The only point of note
concluded by the City of Silver is identical to what Deacon Cesimir
said… Klein nodded thoughtfully in agreement.
“In addition,” Crestet emphasized, “Not only is losing control related
to the potion, it’s also closely related to your emotions and mental
health. The most important thing for a Beyonder is to control
yourself. Only then will you be able to withstand the temptations of
evil gods and devils, resisting emotions like greed and jealousy, and
the erosion of desire. Of course, I don’t mean that you should get rid
of all your emotions and desires, because that is something that no
human or even demigod can do. Yes, perhaps only some special
Sequences are able to achieve that sort of state.”
Klein suddenly thought about Old Neil. He couldn’t help but ask in
reply, “We must keep our emotions and desires at a reasonable level,
and not allowing them to drive us to do something irrational and
abnormal?”
Crestet nodded solemnly.
“Yes.”
After he answered, there were wrinkles at the corner of his eyes.
“That’s all I wanted to warn you about. Now, I’ll pass you the Clown
potion formula and the relevant ingredients.”
He bent down and put his silver suitcase on the long table. He then
turned around and moved a few steps, blocking Klein’s view.
When the surrounding lights strangely vanished again, Klein
suddenly understood that the formula and ingredients were in the
suitcase that stored the holy artifact. It was simply because his gaze
was attracted by the pure white bone sword which was why he didn’t
notice or perhaps, he couldn’t notice, the other items in the suitcase.
After a few minutes, the light of the gas lamps lit up the alchemy
room again. Crestet picked up his suitcase and moved away,
presenting the items on the long table to Klein.
Among them, the most eye-catching item was the palm-sized gray
goat horn. It looked like a miniature version of a normal goat horn
and was crystal clear, swirling with colors. There were faint layers of
unique patterns.
Next to the goat horn was a blue rose. There were red veins on the
petals that connecting them together. It seemed to form a human face
with a smile.
Hahaha, woowoowoo, hahaha, woowoowoo… Klein heard illusory
laughter and crying diﬀused with each other, and he saw pieces of
gray halos ﬂoating in midair.
A crystal of the single horn of a matured Hornacis gray mountain
goat and a complete stalk of a human-faced rose. The main
ingredients of the Clown potion! He nodded indiscernibly and took a
few steps towards the long table.
“80 milliliters of pure water, 5 drops of tornapple juice, 7 grams of
black-rimmed sunﬂower powder, 10 grams of golden cloak grass
powder, 3 drops of poison hemlock…” Klein looked at the unfurled
goatskin parchment and compared the written content with the
formula that he had memorized.
After he conﬁrmed that there was nothing wrong, he recalled the
demonstration Old Neil did.
He took a deep breath and exhaled slowly to collect his emotions.
With the apparatus in the alchemy room, he distilled some pure
water needed by the potion.
In the potion formula, pure water referred to water that was distilled
over and over again.
Then, he washed a black metal pot and threw in the supplementary
ingredients one after another. He was as skillful as back when he had
done chemistry experiments in high school.
As the Beyonder ingredients hadn’t catalyzed just yet, he didn’t see
any obvious changes in the liquid in the metal pot. At most, he only
saw powder ﬂoating on the surface of the liquid.
When he was done with the preparations, Klein cast his gaze at the
two main ingredients and gratefully thought, There’s no description
of the exact size or weight of the required gray mountain goat’s
single horn crystal or the human-faced rose. Perhaps a whole horn
and a complete rose have no diﬀerences, regardless of their weight,
allowing them to meet the requirements… Yes, in the world of
mysterious Beyonders, this is deﬁnitely possible…
If so, I don’t have to worry about putting in excessive amounts of the
main ingredients!
After a few seconds, Klein picked up the human-faced rose and threw
it into the metal pot.
When the strange ﬂower touched the liquid, it immediately produced
a sizzling sound. The surrounding illusory laughter became shrill.
Hahaha, hahaha!
Klein didn’t delay any further as he immediately grabbed the
crystalline mountain goat horn and threw it into the metal pot.
Poof!
The terrifying laughter disappeared all of a sudden, and the
surrounding gray halos slowly converged into the metal pot.
Klein lowered his head and saw the liquid in the pot was colored in a
mix of gold, yellow, and red. However, the three colors remained
extremely distinct at their boundaries.
There were bubbles churning and ﬁzzing from the liquid, but they
failed to escape from the pot and ended up bursting silently.
The scene reminded Klein of Sprite, the carbonated drink from his
previous incarnation.
This actually looks like a delicious drink… A thought popped into his
head that aligned with the characteristics of his culture.
Suppressing his nervousness, excitement, and anticipation, Klein
poured the liquid from the black metal pot into a glass bottle.
What shocked him was that there wasn’t a single bit of the potion left
in the metal pot.
It really is a potion that turns people into Beyonders… Klein raised
his right hand, and he looked at the beautiful-looking tri-colored
liquid.
Crestet Cesimir, who had been silent the entire time, suddenly smiled
and said, “Don’t worry. At the very least, I didn’t notice any problems
with the concoction of your potion.
“I’ve been waiting here to ensure that no accidents happen after you
consume the potion. Don’t worry, as long as it isn’t anything serious,
I should be able to save you.”
Okay. Klein nodded and placed the Clown potion back onto the long
table.
Then, he took oﬀ the silver chain inside his sleeve and let the topaz
pendant hang down naturally, a slight distance above the liquid.
To Beyonders of any other occupation, pendulum divinations could
only divine a yes or no answer. Of course, when there wasn’t enough
information, the divination wouldn’t yield any useful answers at all.
When the pendulum didn’t spin, it was called a failed divination.
As a Seer, Klein’s pendulum could also vaguely determine the degree
of the “yes” or “no” answer.
Klein’s eyes grew dark as he recited, “This potion is harmful.
“This potion is harmful.”
…
Seven times later, he opened his half-closed eyes and saw the topaz
pendant spinning clockwise, but very slowly.
Clockwise means a positive response. In other words, it means that
the potion is harmful… However, it spins slowly, which means that
it’s only slightly harmful… Yes, potions can bring about a loss of
control, so there’s the possibility of harm. A low level of harm means
there is nothing wrong with the potion… Klein let out a breath of
relief and wound the pendulum on his left wrist before covering it
with his sleeve.
At that moment, Crestet couldn’t help but sigh.
“… You really are a professional Seer.”
“I must fully utilize my advantage, but I can’t rely on it too much and
think that it’s all-powerful,” Klein replied softly and took up the
Clown potion bottle.
After drinking it, I’ll become a Sequence 8 Beyonder…
The thought ﬂashed in his mind and Klein didn’t hesitate. He raised
the bottle, tipped his head, and gulped down the potion.
Bitter! So bitter!
It sucks, totally!
He instantly realized what it meant to look good on the outside, but
rotten on the inside. His face had contorted as a result of the potion.
He wanted to puke, but he couldn’t.
Then, Klein realized that his face was ﬂushed red. As for the rest of
his body, they were experiencing a similar reaction.
He was convinced that he looked like a steamed lobster. As for his
spirit and mind, they felt like they had been extracted into a thin
needle, fusing with the potion, drop by drop, as it stabbed into each
and every one of cells.
It was a feeling that needed no microscope to observe his cells. Klein
stood there and “saw” the intruder invade his body’s most minute
areas.
For a few seconds, he felt like a robot that was having its parts and
electrical circuits swapped out.
After an unknown period of time had passed, his mind reﬂected his
ﬁgure, as though he was listening to himself singing through his own
ears.
Due to this strange projection, Klein discovered that he could
precisely control his facial and bodily motions.
Meanwhile, his ears buzzed. He heard the murmurs and shouting
echoing around him which had not happened in a while.
Hornacis… Flegrea… Hornacis… Flegrea… Hornacis… Flegrea…
Phew. Klein imagined the layered spherical light and slowly entered
a Cogitation state. Bit by bit, he escaped from the state of having his
spirituality seep out where he had a slight loss of control.
At that moment, he knew that he had advanced successfully. He
knew that he was a Sequence 8 Clown.
Chapter 169: New Abilities
After the color in Klein’s eyes went back to normal, Crestet Cesimir
said with a laugh, “You can move about and try to get used to the
changes in your body. Try to ﬁnd the core powers that were given to
you by the Clown potion.”
Klein nodded. He considered the fact that he might need guidance
from the deacon and thus didn’t care about his presence. He
repeatedly followed what he had been practicing all this time as he
took a step forward. He twisted his hips and threw a punch forward,
launching a frontal jab.
Pa!
He heard the crisp sound of his ﬁst breaking the air. The power in the
forward thrust exceeded his expectations.
In that instant, he felt as though he was sitting in a carriage which
had abruptly hit the brakes. He lost his balance and fell forward.
Oh no! This is about to become an embarrassing story—just like
Leonard’s… Klein mused. But at that moment, he noticed that he
could still eﬀectively control his muscles, his body, as well as his
center of gravity!
He simultaneously exerted force with his spine, tendons, and
ligaments, instantly adjusting his center of mass and managing to
stand ﬁrm despite his distorted posture.
Well… Upon gaining some understanding of this, Klein attempted
several other actions. He conﬁrmed that the biggest change in his
body was the massive increase in coordination. He would no longer
lose his balance unless there were some extenuating circumstances.
I feel like a roly-poly tumbler… I can even act in a circus now! It
wouldn’t be too hard for me to walk on a rope… The Clown potion
sure lives up to its name… Many thoughts ﬂashed through his mind.
Klein once again tested the extent of the improvements to his
strength, agility, and speed.
Hmm, I should be around the same level as Teacher Gawain. After I
get used to this and go through the specialized training, I’ll deﬁnitely
become more powerful… Also, with my current mastery over my
body, it would be easy for me to grasp combat techniques. Klein
stopped moving and nodded in thought.
According to his plans, he estimated that he would become decent in
combat arts only after half a year. But after consuming the Clown
potion, he felt that it would only take a month, perhaps two or three
weeks, before he could qualify as a policeman that was adept in
combat.
That was the diﬀerence between an average person and a Beyonder.
In a sense, the talents of Beyonders were beyond the reach of normal
humans!
Crestet watched silently as the newly advanced Clown tried out
various actions before completely stopping. He then nodded.
“It truly is a potion adept in the ﬁeld of combat.”
Without waiting for Klein to speak, he asked, “What sounds did you
hear just now?”
“I heard someone muttering Hornacis.” Klein wanted to keep the
term Flegrea a secret for the time being.
He wanted to observe the reaction of Deacon Cesimir. If he was
willing to relay information regarding the Hornacis mountain range
and the Nation of the Evernight, Klein would then add on, saying that
he heard something diﬀerent again.
Crestet nodded slightly, skipping over the topic. He reminded Klein,
“Remember, a High-Sequence Beyonder can inﬂuence corresponding
Low-Sequence Beyonders of the same Sequence pathway to a certain
extent. In a way, some parts of the respective pathways contain the
Realm of Demigods. The murmurings and howls might have been
intentionally conveyed to you by them. They might be ﬁlled with
malicious intent.
“You must be even more cautious if the Sequence pathway belongs to
an evil god. I had a chat with Dunn just now. The Nighthawk in your
team who lost control recently met with such a situation.”
Old Neil… The Hidden Sage… Klein’s expression darkened. He
nodded solemnly and said, “Your Grace, I will remember this. I will
not be tempted by the murmurings or howls. I will not be corrupted
by them.”
At the same time, he thought of something else.
Could this be the reason why the Church only provides the pathways
for Sleepless and Corpse Collector, while hiding a large number of the
other pathways? After all, the Sleepless pathway belongs to the
Evernight Goddess, and Death which corresponds to the Corpse
Collector pathway has already fallen… As for why the Church would
still oﬀer the Mystery Pryer and Seer, it’s because these two jobs are
of a support type and can ﬁll the shortcomings of the Sequence 9 and
8 pathways for Sleepless and Corpse Collector. Furthermore, they’re
only at the beginning of the pathway, so the inﬂuence they can
gather wouldn’t be too prominent…
But this doesn’t explain why they would hide the names and unique
traits of the potions… or the lack of information as to what one
should take note of when facing them…
Klein retracted his thoughts when he saw Crestet Cesimir pick up his
suitcase to leave. He adopted a curious tone.
“Your Grace, I would like to know how to act as a Clown. Do I have
to go to a circus?”
Crestet smoothed his tall collar and chuckled.
“According to our current understanding of philosophy, you just
made the mistake of formalism.
“You need to understand that the name of a potion not only
represents a job. It also represents a group of people that share
certain traits. For example, we can also describe Seers diﬀerently. We
can call them people who can see fate, yet remain respectful of fate.
Of course, as I mentioned before, there are some diﬀerences to the
rules concluded by each individual even if they consumed the same
potion. You cannot completely reference the experiences of another
person, do you understand?”
Klein nodded in thought.
“I think I can understand some of it. I can act as a Clown in my daily
life, as long as I have grasped its essence?”
“In theory,” Crestet answered, being careful about his choice of
words.
“… I understand.” Klein drew a crimson moon on his chest. “Thank
you, Your Grace. May the Goddess bless you.”
Hmm, just what is the essence of a Clown? If I don’t take into
consideration what a clown represents back on Earth and only think
about what it means in this world, a clown is a job that entertains
people using ridiculous methods. For example, hilarious getups,
exaggerated actions, trickster-like performances? The core is that it
must be ridiculous, and it must entertain others. It feels a little oﬀ…
Must I consider it from the perspective of court jesters from ancient
times? Klein thought about it silently as he felt at a loss.
Crestet looked at him and also drew a crimson moon before his chest.
He smiled, revealing the wrinkles at the corner of his eyes.
“May the Goddess bless you too.”
At that moment, Klein suddenly perceived something, an intuition
that felt like a prediction, that Deacon Cesimir would put his left foot
forward!
He then saw Crestet pick up the silver suitcase and step toward the
entrance of the alchemy room with his left foot!
One step, two steps, three steps. Klein watched as Crestet walked out
of the hidden door, his ﬁgure vanishing into the corridor.
This… He was dazed for a moment before he felt intense excitement.
The Beyonder powers of the Clown potion were more powerful than
he imagined!
He could intuitively predict a person’s next course of action!
Was the combination of this ability, coupled with his powerful
coordination, exceptional agility, and speed, as well as decent
strength, considered being good at ﬁghting with artiﬁce? Klein
thought about this revelation.
So, this can be considered the manifestation of the Seer’s abilities in
Sequence 8, but it’s not enough… This pathway must be one that
gives a unique ability every time I advance before reaching a High-
Sequence Beyonder. But the intuitions I get are ﬂeeting, so I don’t
think I can take advantage of them every single time. Of course, this
ability is powerful enough as it is. Taking advantage of it once should
be enough to turn defeat into victory… Oh right, after I reduce the
inﬂuence of the negative eﬀects that come with the Clown potion, I
can try the ritual to summon myself. I nearly forgot about that…
Yeah, the Captain must have infected me with his awful memory!
In the midst of his thoughts, Klein observed himself once again. He
wanted to see if the Clown potion had brought along any other
abilities.
According to the conﬁdential records of the Nighthawks, if the potion
would allow the person who consumed it to gain mastery over a
certain spell, the person would be able to faintly detect what kinds of
spells he obtained after advancing as if he was being instilled with
knowledge.
But I don’t sense any of that. In other words, Clown doesn’t come
with the ability to quickly cast spells, as reported in the conﬁdential
records of the Nighthawks… Could the meaning of “crafty” be that I
can now eﬀectively use my expressions and body language to more
easily fool people with my lies? Klein stretched his neck while
seriously analyzing his current condition.
At this moment, he couldn’t help but think back to the suited clown
he had encountered previously. The clown’s peculiar and varied
spells had left a deep impression.
Hmm, that member of the Secret Order is probably a Sequence 7
Beyonder. His clown getup was purely to mask his facial features to
avoid being placed on a wanted list… It’s no wonder that he could
hold his own against two Sequence 7s and a Sequence 8… If he had
deciphered the fact that I wasn’t under the inﬂuence of Sealed
Artifact 2-049 and avoided falling under its control, ten of me might
not have been enough to deal with him.
Of course, Clown is not completely devoid of spells. There are still
spells like these…
Klein walked toward the long table and picked up the piece of paper
that the Clown formula was written on.
His pupils darkened and with a ﬂick of his wrist, he tossed the piece
of paper into the air.
Pa!
It was as if the soft piece of paper had become a dagger, and it
pierced itself into the wall of the alchemy room!
I can bring a deck of tarot cards with me in the future. They can be
used both for divination or as weapons. Klein collected himself and
started to pack up the objects left behind from the potion’s
concoction.
After dealing with this and burning the formula for the potion, Klein
exhaled and left the alchemy room, closing the secret door behind
him.
For the time being, he didn’t feel like trying to entertain others
through ridiculous methods because of what happened to Old Neil.
He intended to lessen the inﬂuence of the potion through Cogitation
ﬁrst.
Phew, this is going to be a brand new experience again… No matter
what happens, I’m no longer just a supporting member… Yes, ever
since Old Neil passed away, I’m the only one left in the Tingen
Nighthawks team that can provide support. The Holy Cathedral will
most likely send a Mystery Pryer or a Seer to the team… Klein
followed the wall lamps, walking down the dark corridor, and calmly
made his way up the stairs leading to the Blackthorn Security
Company.
He then saw the sunlight in the Nighthawks’ recreation room.
The sunlight shone in through the oriel window, sunlight which was
pure and warm.
Chapter 170: Copper Whistle
Klein turned towards the Captain’s oﬃce and saw that the door was
wide open. Dunn Smith was leaning back in his chair, sniﬃng at his
pipe.
When Dunn swept his gray eyes at him, he changed his seating
posture.
“You seem to be in good shape, nothing like someone who had just
consumed a potion.”
“This might be the advantage of fully digesting a potion before
leveling up.” Klein closed the door behind him and took a seat.
He and Dunn both knew about the “acting method,” so their oath
didn’t keep them from talking about the “acting method” with each
other. They could exchange their thoughts about it, but the two of
them didn’t bring it up with a tacit understanding. They fell silent at
the same time after the exchange.
Klein thought and asked, “Has His Grace left?”
“Yes, as a high-ranking deacon, he has other matters to take care of.”
Dunn thought for a moment. “Oh, he took the pair of red eyeballs
that remained after Old Neil died.”
Klein was shocked and confused.
“Why?”
Dunn picked up his coﬀee and took a sip. He answered after a long
silence, “We shouldn’t lie to ourselves. A Rampager is in fact already
a monster, and as I told you before, monsters leave behind things that
are rich with Beyonder powers after they die. When these relics can’t
be controlled, they have to be sealed. Yes, that is one of the most
common origins of Sealed Artifacts. According to the Nighthawks’
internal rules, the items left behind by Rampagers need to be stored
elsewhere, so that they won’t trigger their partners.”
“A logical rule.” Klein nodded heavily.
Suddenly, he sharply noticed that the Captain had missed out
something. So, he asked curiously, “What if the item left behind is
controllable?”
Dunn looked at him, his gray eyes were deep like a quiet night.
He sighed and said, “You wouldn’t want to know the answer.”
Klein was taken aback before he suddenly realized a possibility.
Normal monsters left behind Beyonder ingredients which could be used to
make potions.
But what of a Rampager who turned into a monster?
If they left behind controllable items, would those things be used as
Beyonder ingredients?
Upon realizing that, Klein suddenly felt a strong sense of disgust. He
couldn’t help but turn his head to retch. Even his sight suddenly grew
blurry.
This is such a terrifying theory… But it’s an answer that’s highly likely of
being closer to the truth! In that instant, he had a deeper understanding of
sayings like “To ﬁght against the abyss, we have to endure the corruption
of the abyss,” and “We are guardians, but also a bunch of miserable
wretches that are constantly ﬁghting against threats and madness.”
Would this be one of the reasons why the Church hides the “acting
method”? So that they can recycle a certain number of their own members
for spare parts? But this will make members of the upper echelons reject
the Church… Klein’s face clearly reﬂected his changing expressions.
Upon seeing his response, Dunn suddenly laughed. There was a
twinkling light in his gray eyes.
“Think about it on the brighter side of things, you can think of it as
our teammates watching over us in a diﬀerent form. They will be
with us forever.”
After saying that, Dunn lowered his head, picked up his coﬀee, and
brought it to his mouth.
After nearly twenty seconds of silence, he lifted his head and said,
“And you don’t have to worry. As long as we can ﬁnd sources of
Beyonder ingredients, we wouldn’t do what you were thinking about.
“Alright, according to the rules, you’ll receive a day oﬀ since you just
advanced. You can decide whether or not you want to go to your
combat training this afternoon, but you have to inform Gawain either
way.”
Klein gently nodded. Taking a deep breath, he straightened his back
and said, “Captain, I have ﬁnished my lessons on mysticism. I’d like
to use my mornings to learn techniques such as tracking and
monitoring.”
He paused and added with a serious expression, “I’d like to fulﬁll my
full duty as a Nighthawk soon.”
Dunn gave him a piercing look and sighed.
“You’re tougher than I imagined. As you wish.”
“Yes, Captain!” Klein suddenly stood up and drew a crimson moon on
his chest.
…
After leaving the Blackthorn Security Company, Klein didn’t return
home to rest, but instead, took the opportunity to take a trackless
carriage to Azik’s place.
Ding dong, ding dong.
As the doorbell rang clearly, Azik opened the door in a white shirt
and black vest.
There was a gold watch chain hanging from his vest pocket.
“Don’t you need to work?” Azik took a glance at the sky and realized
that the sun had yet to climb to its peak.
“I actually have most of the day oﬀ due to some special
circumstances,” Klein explained vaguely.
Azik looked at him and appeared to notice something as he nodded
and made way for Klein’s entry.
At the hallway, Klein set his cane aside, took oﬀ his hat, and followed
Azik to the living room.
The living room was comfortably furnished with a ﬁreplace, rocking
chair, couches, and a coﬀee table. Klein sat at his usual spot.
Azik sat down opposite Klein and pointed at the cigars on the coﬀee
table.
“Do you want one?”
“No.” Klein shook his head ﬁrmly.
Azik didn’t attempt to persuade him as he struck a match and lit one
of the cigars. At the same time, he asked casually, “Have you taken
care of the matter at Morse Town?”
“I have to thank you for that,” Klein replied sincerely.
At the same time, he secretly lampooned, Mr. Azik, before you lost
your memories, you deﬁnitely must’ve left behind quite a sizable wealth
for yourself. Otherwise, how could a teacher who isn’t even an associate
professor be able to enjoy cigars so frequently?
As Azik was ﬁddling with his cigar, Klein brought up a matter.
“Mr. Azik, I have something to ask you.”
“What is it?” Azik replied without lifting his head.
Klein paused and organized his words.
“One of my colleagues lost control and became a monster. I’d like to
know if his spirit was contaminated?”
He wasn’t certain if Mr. Azik knew the meaning of “losing control,”
so he prepared an explanation, just in case.
Azik stopped what he was doing and lifted his head to look at Klein.
He nodded heavily and said, “No doubt. You have to be very careful
in a situation like that. If he lost control due to the temptation of an
evil god or devil, try to avoid contacting his spirit. It might very
likely lead to life-threatening danger.”
“I understand.” Klein let out a breath of disappointment.
When he was at Old Neil’s place, he was too emotional and had
forgotten to contact Old Neil’s spirit. Neither did Dunn Smith remind
him at all. Hence, he missed the opportunity entirely.
Now that I think of it, Captain didn’t forget but intentionally avoided
bringing it up…Klein was silent in thought.
He didn’t dwell on the topic and instead mentioned his previous
encounter.
“Mr. Azik, I tried to divine the origins of Morse Town’s paranormal
incidents. I ended up seeing an upside-down pyramid that extended
underground. My teammate told me that it’s a symbol of Death. Only
His descendants would receive such an honor.”
Azik put down the match and took up the cigar cutter when he
suddenly fell into a daze. He was motionless for quite a while.
He leaned back into his seat and wore an unusually gloomy
expression.
After a while, he said in a deep voice, “This gives me a very familiar
feeling, but I don’t seem to be recalling anything.”
“I’m very sorry.” Klein sighed sincerely.
He had imagined that he could use the revelation obtained from his
divination to further jolt Mr. Azik’s memories.
Azik cut oﬀ the cigar cap, shook his head, and smiled bitterly.
“If it was something that could be recalled easily, I think I would’ve
long found a way to escape my fate. Of course, I have to thank you
for your kindness. Thank you for remembering about me this entire
time.”
He thought for a moment before adding, “Oh, and I’ll be leaving
Tingen in the near future.”
“Why?” Klein asked in surprise.
Didn’t we say that we were going to ﬁnd the manipulator behind the
scenes, the person who aﬀected my fate, and stole your child’s skull?
Azik held his cigar and sighed before explaining, “The target might’ve
noticed my attention and investigation. He hasn’t been taking any
action recently, leaving me with no clues. Thus, I’m thinking of
leaving Tingen for the time being and going to Backlund. On one
hand, I can take the opportunity to search for traces that I left behind
before I lost my memories. On the other hand, my absence might let
the target lower his guard.”
That’s right. Mr. Azik’s last memory loss was around Backlund University.
It’s a pity that you can’t take my place, searching for the red chimney
house… Klein nodded solemnly and said,
“I’ll pay close attention to this. Once the target takes action and
exposes himself, I’ll inform you immediately.
“Hmm. Mr. Azik, how will I inform you of things in a timely
manner?”
Klein had the idea that if Azik was Death’s descendant, or if he was
linked to Death in a certain way, his powers would have been
something similar to the Corpse Collector Sequence. He deﬁnitely
had a way to call something like Daly’s messenger.
In other words, this could conﬁrm if Azik was actually related to
Death or a descendant of Death.
Azik took a puﬀ of his cigar and thought for nearly twenty seconds.
He took out an ornament from his left sleeve.
It was an intricate but old copper whistle. There were many unique
patterns that ﬁlled it with a mysterious aura.
“This is something that I had with me when I woke up in Backlund.
When you blow it, you’ll summon a messenger that belongs to me.”
Azik held the copper whistle as he explained in detail.
After so many years, this copper whistle can still be used? This should be
a magical item, right? Klein was surprised and delighted that he had
indirectly proved that Mr. Azik was related to Death.
Azik gave Klein a glance, then he put the copper whistle to his mouth
and demonstrated.
His cheeks puﬀed up as he blew with all his might.
Nothing was heard, but Klein felt a sudden gloominess and coldness.
He quickly tapped his left molar and saw that there were blurry
white bones being thrown up from the ground, one after another,
forming a strange fountain.
After a few seconds, there was an illusory monster in the living room.
Its body was made of white bones, and there were dark ﬂames
glowing in its eye sockets. It was almost four meters tall, and it
towered over Klein, who wasn’t even 175cm tall.
As he watched its head nearly tear through the ceiling, Klein
suddenly had a thought, Mr. Azik, isn’t your messenger a little… too
exaggerated?
Azik didn’t share those thoughts at all. He smiled and said, “After you
pass the letter to it, blow the whistle again to end the summoning.
Then, it’ll send the letter to me very quickly, in a secretive manner.”
After that, Azik shook his wrist and threw the old copper whistle
across the room.
Klein extended his right hand and accurately caught it. He found it
cold but mild.
Thank you Clown potion… He breathed a sigh of relief. He wiped the
whistle and blew it hard.
Silently, the huge messenger fell apart as blurry white bones sank
underground.
…
The Tussock River ran through Backlund and harbors that dotted
around the area.
Alger Wilson wore the long priest robes of the Church of the Lord of
Storms as he walked down from the passenger ship slowly.
He saw people walking to and fro around the harbor with countless
port workers sweating under the sun. It was a bustling yet noisy
scene.
“It’s been a while, Backlund,” Alger muttered to himself.
Chapter 171: Promotion and
Pay Raise
After leaving Azik’s house, Klein took a public carriage back to
Daﬀodil Street.
As he opened the door to his house, he suddenly saw a ﬁgure sitting
in his dining room.
Klein instinctively tightened his grip on the cane in his hand, but
quickly realized what was going on. It wasn’t a thief, but his maid,
Bella.
Bella was focused on reading a spread-out newspaper on the table.
She jumped in shock when she heard the door open, quickly standing
up and stammering, “I-I was just done with the tasks for the morning.
I was w-waiting for the water to boil so that I could eat some bread.”
I’m still not really used to having a maid in the house… Klein mocked
himself. He took oﬀ his hat and nodded.
“Reading is a good habit. To be able to persist in reading, despite the
busy workload, is something that’s encouraged by the Goddess.”
He used the name of the Goddess just in case Bella took his
compliment as sarcasm.
But in reality, only the God of Knowledge and Wisdom would place this
much emphasis on reading… Of course, all of the Churches advocate
education… Yes, since she’s about 18 years old and believes in the
Goddess, Bella’s love for reading must be inﬂuenced by her parents.
Parents like this would send their daughter to receive an education as long
as they can aﬀord it. Even if they cannot aﬀord public schools, there are
always the free schools provided by the Church. At most, it would just
delay her education… Thus, Bella isn’t illiterate. She can understand
words and read the newspaper… Klein thought as he walked into the
living room after setting his cane down.
He had quite a good impression of Bella.
Even though she was a little clumsy and obviously not used to the
kitchen, she had shown a willingness to learn.
Bella let her hands hang down and said, embarrassed, “I didn’t have
the opportunity to read many newspapers in the past. The landlord
didn’t let us use old newspapers to clean the walls… I stole a glance
at it when I picked up the newspapers just now to clean the coﬀee
table. I thought that-that it was rather interesting.”
What a pitiful lady. When I transmigrated, newspapers were the least
interesting of things… Klein thought as he lampooned. He smiled and
took out the silver pocket watch from his pocket. After looking at the
time, he said, “As long as you complete your tasks and do them well,
you are free to do whatever you want with the rest of your time. You
don’t need to be too nervous. Of course, if I’m having a chat with
Benson and Melissa, it’s best that you stay in your room. I will allow
you to use the lamp inside and take a few old newspapers with you.”
“Oh, please knock at my door at one in the afternoon, then prepare a
cup of Sibe black tea, two pieces of soft white bread, a piece of wheat
toast, and a small plate of butter for me.”
In order to celebrate his advancement to Sequence 8, Klein decided to
spoil himself slightly. He was going to eat the white bread ahead of
Benson who was planning on having it over the weekend.
Well, I’ll buy eight more pounds of bread soon. In the future, we shall
make the change in our staple dish, from wheat bread to white bread! As
a Sequence 8 Beyonder, my weekly pay is deﬁnitely going to increase…
To think that the Captain didn’t mention this… He forgot again! Klein
froze for a moment and decided to clarify it tomorrow.
“Alright,” Bella replied in surprise and joy.
Following that, she asked with a little uncertainty, “Mr. Klein, do you
mean the Sibe black tea used to entertain guests?”
She called him by his ﬁrst name as Moretti could be used to refer to
anyone in the family.
“Yes, that shall be my usual tea in the future.” Klein waved his hand
and made his way towards the stairs.
He suddenly noticed that he was in a decent ﬁnancial situation after
becoming a Clown.
This was partly because there were no other large expenses for the
time being. He only needed to spend two soli on transport while he
was investigating the houses with red chimneys, and on the materials
that he needed to purchase occasionally. Claims could be made for
the latter most of the time anyway.
Also, there was a sum of 300 pounds in Klein’s anonymous bank
account. It was important to understand that one are 1 of land in the
countryside only cost ﬁve to six and a half soli, which was another
way of saying that Klein could aﬀord 920 to 1200 ares of farmland,
which was equivalent to 137 to 179 mou 2 back on Earth.
Furthermore, this sum of money could allow Klein to buy a house on
Daﬀodil Street on a contract for 15 years.
If I convert all that money into land, I’ll get between 23 and 31 pounds a
year in rent… That’s not bad, but not necessary for the time being. I’ll use
that 300 pounds for emergencies… I’ll have to ﬁnd an opportunity to tell
Benson and Melissa about my true weekly salary! Klein thought as he
entered his room.
After locking the door to his room, Klein sat on the edge of his bed
and started his Cogitation. He wanted to use this method to slowly
control the powers seeping out of his potion. He was very careful and
very cautious.
He had thought of the term “losing control” very lightly until he saw
the Mandated Punisher who had lost control.
Of course, he didn’t know that Mandated Punisher personally. He
also didn’t know what had happened to him. He subconsciously
thought of him as an anomaly, a rare case.
It was just like how an average person would make comments about
a murder they saw on the news before forgetting about it entirely.
But what happened to Old Neil shook Klein greatly. It made him
realize very clearly that losing control was always a possibility,
always around him. Loss of control might descend upon him in ways
he had never thought about!
That sure was a bloody lesson… Klein ended his Cogitation and
muttered to himself as he opened his eyes.
He had dreamed of that scene many times in the past few days,
jolting awake in the process and ﬁnding himself drenched in cold
sweat.
He wasn’t only grieving Old Neil’s death, but also worried about his
future. If he didn’t have Cogitation to help him sleep, he believed
that there would be many sleepless nights in his future.
Other than digesting the potion, I also have to try my best to control my
emotions and desires. I have to keep them within reasonable levels and not
be consumed by them… Klein exhaled and laid down, quickly falling
asleep.
On the day that Old Neil passed away, Dunn’s actions and words had
touched him greatly. It made him critically assess the responsibilities
of a Nighthawk for the ﬁrst time. It made him want to take up his
responsibilities and help his Captain and teammates.
Thus, he didn’t intend to waste his afternoon. He was going to
continue his combat lessons.
…
Three in the afternoon, on a crude training ﬁeld.
The blond crew-cut Gawain creased his brows as he witnessed Klein
slowly familiarize himself with the motions, going from the
movements of a decent beginner to the movements of an apprentice
knight who had been practicing for a good six months.
All this happened in the short span of forty minutes!
He called for Klein to stop and sized him up. He couldn’t help but
ask, “What happened?”
Klein had already come up with an excuse. He was prepared to
attribute his performance to scientiﬁc research when Gawain added,
“You don’t need to answer if it’s inconvenient for you to do so.”
It looks like there was some communication between the police department
and Gawain… It makes sense; he has to train Beyonders occasionally, so
how could he not know? Klein heaved a sigh of relief. He smiled as he
said, “Teacher, how long do you think I will need before I can take
part in actual combat?”
Gawain crossed his arms and looked at Klein seriously. He replied
with a raspy voice, “Two or three days, but that isn’t enough!”
He explained, as if in thought, “Being able to take part in actual
combat isn’t the same as being good at ﬁghting. The latter would take
another two to three weeks.
“Furthermore, you need to gain mastery over weapons that you can
bring with you, for example, a cane, whips, daggers, and bayonets!”
… There’s still so many to learn? Klein was dumbfounded.
Gawain swept his experienced gaze at him.
“Remember, every drop of sweat you lose here might save your life in
the future.”
“Yes, Teacher!” Klein pumped himself up and answered.
…
On Sunday morning, Klein entered the Blackthorn Security Company
and knocked on the door of the Captain’s oﬃce.
Dunn Smith looked up as if he was expecting this.
“I forgot to inform you yesterday. Your position at the police
department has risen from probationary inspector to inspector now
that you have advanced to Sequence 8. I’ll get them to issue the
appropriate documents and epaulets to you as soon as possible.
“Your weekly salary will also increase from six pounds to ten pounds.
The Church and the police department will each bear half of your
salary. This salary is the level of an experienced Nighthawk; of
course, I mean an experienced Nighthawk at Sequence 9.”
… Captain, are you following the wrong script? Klein was taken aback
as he listened to the Captain. His eyebrows relaxed as he smiled.
“That’s more than I imagined.”
He had imagined that his weekly salary would only increase to eight
pounds.
Dunn lifted his cup of coﬀee and took a sip.
“The increase in salary for Nighthawks is ﬁrstly dependent on years
of service, second on contribution, and third on the level of your job.
The third criterion is often highly correlated with your
contributions.”
Right, without any contributions, even if one were to digest their potion,
they would be unable to apply for the formula and materials… Klein
nodded while in thought.
A weekly salary of 10 pounds, coupled with any bonuses would mean
a yearly salary of about 540 pounds. Since he didn’t need to pay any
taxes, this salary was fairly high in the middle-income bracket, just
lower than desirable occupations such as esteemed lawyers, famous
architects, experienced surgeons, and government workers.
Even the vice president of the Loen Kingdom’s treasury only makes 700
pounds a year before tax. That’s at most 640 pounds after tax, probably
lower… According to the newspapers, a decent house in Backlund and
Hillston only costs about 2500 pounds. With Benson, Melissa, and my
current expenditure, we could buy one in seven or eight years… To be
able to aﬀord a bungalow in the central area of the capital in just seven or
eight years purely through my own eﬀorts, this salary makes me happy
indeed… Klein got up and bade farewell. He quickly walked to the
basement and took his shift at Chanis Gate.
Before it was ten, he suddenly heard someone approaching Chanis
Gate.
Soon after, Dunn appeared at the door.
“There’s a case that requires your help.”
“An incident involving Beyonders?” Klein instinctively asked.
“No, a parliamentary representative of this city, Mr. Maynard, was
found dead in his house. The Tingen Police Department is under huge
pressure and wants us to use a mediumship ritual to help them
pinpoint the murderer. Currently, you are the only person on the
team who can do that,” Dunn explained. Then he added, “The Holy
Cathedral will send over a Mystery Pryer to our team next week.
Actually, it should’ve been done a long time ago, but you happened
to join and chose to be a Seer.”
Chapter 172: "Autopsy"
“How long has the Member of Parliament been dead for?” Klein
asked straightforwardly as he packed up his things.
If it was more than ﬁfteen minutes, the information that he could
obtain would decline considerably. If it was more than an hour, there
would be very little left to ﬁnd.
If it was more than a month, contact with the spirit of the dead
would most likely fail.
“Regrettably, the initial autopsy report shows that Mr. Maynard died
between nine and eleven last night.” Dunn shook his head and said,
“You only need to provide assistance and not consider if you can be
of use.”
“Alright.” Klein took his coat and walked out of the duty room with
his hat and cane in hand. Dunn Smith took his place at the Chanis
Gate guardroom.
Theoretically, as a Beyonder, as long as one’s spirituality was
enhanced, things like Spirit Vision, divination, and ritualistic magic
could be learned. Especially for Beyonders from the Sleepless
Sequence who were known for their high spirituality.
But in actual fact, the diﬀerences between the various sequences was
vastly obvious. Dunn Smith and Leonard Mitchell had learned Spirit
Vision, but they could only see faint white or light blue in the auras
of others. They were unable to precisely diﬀerentiate the status of
diﬀerent body parts. Of course, they could deﬁnitely see spiritual
things with Spirit Vision, but doing so wasn’t as eﬀective as using
their spiritual perception.
That also led to a problem in which Beyonders at the Sleepless,
Midnight Poet, and Nightmare Sequences didn’t enjoy activating their
Spirit Vision.
Similarly, if they were willing to, they could also learn spirit
pendulums, dowsing, dream divination, and so on. But their rate of
success wasn’t something worth noting.
It was the same situation with ritualistic magic as well.
When the two of them walked past one another, Dunn suddenly said,
“I forgot to tell you that Inspector Tolle is in charge of the case. He’s
waiting for you at the reception hall in the security company.
Remember to change into your new uniform and grab your new
documents.”
Klein wasn’t surprised and replied with a smile, “New uniform, new
documents? The Tingen Police Department sure is eﬃcient.”
He had just advanced to Sequence 8 the day before…
“It’s because this case is very important, so…” Dunn spread his hands
and took up Klein’s previous spot.
Klein walked upstairs, but he wasn’t in a hurry to go to the reception
hall. He entered the Nighthawks’ break room and entered the
attached bathroom to relieve himself. There was only a toilet bowl, a
water bottle, and a bucket in the duty room.
Then, he changed into his police uniform that revealed his promotion
to two silver stars and put on his peak cap with the “two crossed
swords and a crown.”
After transferring his Flaring Sun Charm, Azik’s copper whistle, his
ritual ingredients, and other items, Klein smoothed out his uniform,
took his cane, and exited the break room.
He passed through the partition and saw Inspector Tolle seated in the
sofa area.
It had been a while since they last met. The tall police oﬃcer seemed
to have gained some weight, and his stomach was even more
outstanding. With his thick mustache and hair, he looked like a
brown bear that had just escaped from a circus.
“I’m glad to work with you again.” When Tolle saw that it was a
Nighthawk that he knew, he let out a breath of relief. He stood up
and extended his bear paw.
No, palm… Klein corrected himself and shook the other person’s hand
as a polite gesture.
“Me too.”
Tolle stole a glance at Klein’s two shimmering silver stars shoulder
strap and said with envy, “We’re at the same rank now, and it hasn’t
even been a month.”
At ﬁrst, Klein wanted to reply solemnly that “The danger that we
encounter is ten times worse than yours,” but he remembered his
identity then: Sequence 8 Clown.
Maybe I can give it a try… Using his spirituality, he looked at the
reﬂection of his facial expression. He lifted the corner of his lips and
replied with a smile, “Maybe in another few months, you’ll have to
call me ‘Sir.'”
“You sure are humorous.” Tolle chuckled and pointed at the door.
“Shall we head out?”
“Alright.” Klein hadn’t given up his cane. Now that he had become a
Clown, the cane was truly a viable weapon.
After exiting the Blackthorn Security Company, Klein and Tolle
walked down side by side, forming a great contrast due to the
skinniness and fatness of the two.
“I feel like we could even make an audience at the circus laugh,”
Klein suddenly jested.
Tolle nodded in absolute agreement and said, “Yes, I feel our vast
contrast brings a comedic eﬀect. Do you know that some circuses are
trying to use fat and skinny, tall and short clown combinations in
their performances?”
No, actually I meant a beast tamer and a brown bear… Klein, of course,
wouldn’t make such a rude remark. He went along with it and
replied, “It’s a pity that there are no ﬁxed circuses in Tingen.”
“That’s right, but we have operas, theaters, and music halls,”
Inspector Tolle replied wistfully.
They casually chatted until they got onto the police carriage. Then,
Klein redirected the topic back to the case.
“Is it conﬁrmed that Mr. Maynard was murdered?”
“We can’t be certain, but his wife and two sons aren’t willing to
believe the possibility that he died due to a sudden illness. And there
was really something wrong at the scene. When Maynard was found,
he was naked on the guestroom’s bed,” Tolle said as he deliberated.
“He sleeps separately from his wife?” Klein leaned back against the
carriage wall and mimicked the main character in various detective
ﬁlms.
Tolle shook his head and said, “No, his wife hasn’t been in Tingen
recently. She went to Backlund to attend a very important social ball.
You might not know, but she’s the leader of a new party. She’s the
daughter of someone from the House of Commons. She’s still on her
way back to Tingen via steam locomotive. She merely used the
telegram to express her opinion on this matter.”
“Maynard is also a member of the new party. He’s been a Tingen’s
Member of Parliament for more than ten years. He intended to run
for mayor in next year’s election.”
“In other words, his death might be related to this?” Klein asked
casually and immediately laughed. “I’m sorry, I’m only supposed to
be helping with the autopsy. The rest of the matter is not within my
area of concern, you don’t have to answer.”
Tolle didn’t mind much but sighed.
“Autopsy… You’re very cautious.”
“As for your guesses, I would only say that there’s a possibility. There
was a gathering last night at Maynard’s place. There were too many
guests, and we temporarily can’t ﬁnd any main suspects. Plus, these
guests have decent backgrounds, so we have to be very careful. We
can’t make any mistakes.”
“I understand.” Klein nodded faintly and asked about the details of
the scene.
Maynard’s house was a bungalow located in the Golden Indus
borough. It was surrounded by gardens and ﬁelds, there was a stable,
a fountain, and a broad pathway built from cement.
Klein put on his peak hat with its police badge and followed behind
Inspector Tolle. They passed through the police streamer and entered
the double-story house under the gaze of every policeman present.
In the living room, there were two male and four female
probationary inspectors who were talking to people individually to
gather statements.
Klein looked around and saw many gentlemen in tuxedos and a few
ladies in glamorous dresses and checkered gauze hats.
“They’re the guests who spent the night here,” Tolle explained and
led Klein up the stairs to the second ﬂoor directly.
Along the way, when the police constables who were searching
through the rooms saw the two, they revealed a look of respect
without stopping them. Perhaps it was the eﬀect of the inspector
epaulets.
“This is the guest room where Maynard’s corpse was discovered.” The
brawny Tolle stopped by the crimson wooden door.
Klein thought and asked, “Which guest was assigned to this guest
room?”
“Nobody. There are too many guest rooms in the house, so it wasn’t
used.” Tolle put on his white gloves and turned the knob of the
crimson wooden door.
He made the constable who was keeping watch leave temporarily.
Then, he nodded at Klein and said, “Inspector Moretti, I’ll leave the
rest to you.”
“May the Goddess bless us, and I hope that we ﬁnd something.” Klein
put on his white gloves too and locked the door behind him.
He walked to the side of the bed and saw that the crimson bedsheets
were abnormally messy. The corpse laying on it was covered with a
white cloth.
At this point, Klein could be considered to be quite experienced. He
pulled away the white cloth without fear and looked at Member of
Parliament Maynard.
The man was in his forties. His blond hair was trimmed short, and his
expression was a mixture of pain and happiness.
Klein took two steps back and took out the ingredients he needed. He
quickly ﬁnished the setup for the mediumship ritual.
As the faint calming fragrance swirled around him, he recited the
divination statement that he thought of long ago, “The cause of
Maynard’s death.”
“The cause of Maynard’s death.”
…
As he recited the statement, Klein retreated to a nearby high back
chair and sat down slowly.
His eyes darkened, then he leaned back and quickly fell into a deep
sleep.
In the illusory and blurry world, he suddenly saw the gentleman from
earlier.
With his opened blue eyes, Maynard was laying prostrate above a
woman with an outstanding body and fair skin. He was thrusting
hard against her body.
He ﬁrst displayed an expression of extreme satisfaction and
happiness. Then, he suddenly clutched his chest with his right hand.
His expression then grew contorted.
Pa!
As Maynard fell, the image quickly shattered. Klein opened his eyes
and woke up from his dream.
I can’t believe I can actually watch porn in such a manner… So, Maynard
had an aﬀair and died of exhaustion? Klein chuckled and massaged his
temples.
He took out a pen and paper before doing another ritual. He drew a
portrait of the lady he had seen in his dream with the aid of the
ritual. Of course, everything below her neck was omitted.
It was a woman whose age was hard to tell. She had the mature vibe
of a woman in her thirties, but there was a remnant of innocence to
her. Her eyes were crystal clear, and she had a delicate look.
Klein looked at his work, then put away his ritual ingredients, and
dispelled the spirituality wall.
He leaned sideways to grab his silver-edged cane.
Suddenly, he heard the reverberating sound of someone clearing their
throat. He immediately got goosebumps!
Klein looked towards the bed and saw Maynard gripping the crimson
bedsheets so tightly that the tendons on the backs of his hands were
protruding out.
With a swoosh, the Member of Parliament who died between nine
and eleven the previous night suddenly sat up. Saliva drooled from
the corners of his lips as he opened his vacant eyes wide.
Chapter 173: Zombieﬁcation
Before Klein could come up with any new ideas, he saw the rigid
Maynard lift both his hands up. Its body lunged forward to his left
amidst the sound of hurtling wind!
In the past, his dulled reactions under such sudden, unexpected
situations would’ve made it hard for him to avoid this. Even if he had
noticed the attack ahead of time, he would have had to roll away to
avoid the fast-moving corpse.
But now, Klein could nearly react on instinct. He stomped down with
his bright, buttonless leather boots and jumped diagonally onto the
high-back chair.
As it had only been a day since he advanced, he was still getting used
to his power, agility, and speed. He had accidentally leaped too high
into the air and landed on the top of the chair’s high-back!
It was a narrow edge. Klein’s heart tightened as he quickly controlled
his body and adjusted his center of gravity.
He wavered for a moment and surprisingly managed to stabilize
himself, like a black cat ﬂaunting its balance and poise.
As he was wavering, he ﬂailed his left arm, swinging his cane into the
zombie’s ribs as it pounced forward. The strike caused it to lose its
balance as it staggered and fell onto the carpet.
Klein was standing on top of the chair as he felt for his revolver by
raising his right arm. He attempted to pull it out from the holster so
that he could deliver a silver demon hunting bullet at the zombie in
front of him.
But in that instant, he suddenly wondered about the aftermath.
If he were to blow a hole in Member of Parliament Maynard’s corpse,
how was he going to explain the cause of death to the deceased’s
family or Members of Parliament who were focusing on the matter?
All I did was double-tap his corpse?
As he was thinking, Klein reached into the pocket of his police
uniform and felt for a triangular plate.
The Requiem Charm… He quickly made a decision. He took out the
silver amulet without hesitation and let out a low shout in Hermes,
“Crimson!”
As the incantation reverberated within the room, the charm started to
release a peaceful aura. Klein quickly infused his spirituality into the
amulet and tossed it to Zombie Maynard who was struggling to get
up.
A cold blue ﬁre appeared, enveloping the triangular plate. A serene
and gentle black aura spread forth rapidly, eliminating the anxiety
and worry of the soul.
Zombie Maynard stopped there, his eyes staring blankly at the
ground. His saliva dripped onto the carpet.
Klein heaved a sigh of relief and planned to take out the materials
and set up a ritual to purify the desecrated being, but suddenly,
Maynard once again let out a groan, his blank eyes focused on the
left pocket of Klein’s police uniform again.
Shit… Klein leaped from the top of the chair to the ledge of the oriel
window.
At the same time, he heard the sound of the chair breaking.
Klein had no choice but to take out a rectangular silver plate.
The Slumber Charm!
It wasn’t only living things that could be put into a deep sleep. The
dead were in a state of eternal sleep and would only be woken up
under unusual circumstances!
In certain books on mysticism, there was even such a description
regarding zombies: They slumber by the day and wake up in the
night.
“Crimson!”
Klein once again recited the incantation in Hermes. He intended to
disregard the consequences and shoot the corpse with his revolver if
that failed again.
The problems that came later wouldn’t matter if he was dead!
As he felt the silver rectangular plate in his palm turn cold, Klein
injected his spirituality into it and tossed the charm out.
A dark red ﬂame illuminated his eyes as the sound of a light
explosion reverberated around the room.
A gentle power spread forth, bringing with it a fatigue that aﬀected
every living being. Zombie Maynard had just propped himself up
using the chair when he wavered. His eyes closed, and he fell on his
back with a plop.
With what had just happened, Klein didn’t dare to relax. He
immediately took out the Amantha extract distilled from Night
vanilla, Slumber ﬂower, and Chamomile, as well as the bark of the
Drago tree, and the Full Moon Essence Oil made from Moon ﬂowers.
He quickly set up a sacriﬁcial altar.
Right on the heels of that, he sealed the surrounding area with a
spirituality wall with the aid of Holy Night Powder, encompassing
the altar and the sleeping Zombie Maynard.
After silently reciting the incantation and lighting three
corresponding candles, he dripped a few drops of essential oil extract
and scattered various powders onto the ﬂames. Klein then took a step
back and cautiously looked at Zombie Maynard. He then recited in
Hermes,
“Oh Evernight Goddess, nobler than the stars and more eternal than
eternity.
“I pray for your loving grace.
“I pray that you look over your loyal guardian,
“I pray for the power of the crimson.
“I pray for the power of sleep and silence,
“I pray that you purify the unclean being around me, the gentleman
once called John Maynard.”
…
“Moon ﬂower, a herb that belongs to the red moon, please bestow
your powers to my incantation!
“Slumber ﬂower, a herb that belongs to the red moon, please bestow
your powers to my incantation!”
…
It was as if a midnight breeze blew within the wall of spirituality. A
thin veil of black steam started to billow from Zombie Maynard.
When everything settled, Klein used his Spirit Vision and divination
to repeatedly conﬁrm that the zombie wouldn’t “awaken” once more.
After seeing the results, his worries eased. He ended the ritual and
dispelled the wall of spirituality.
“Why would he suddenly come back to life?” Klein stood in front of
Maynard, who was on the carpet. He knitted his brows as he looked
down at the corpse.
To a Beyonder with high spiritual sensitivity, there were obvious
signs to note if a corpse would come back to life or not, much less
Klein, who was a Seer. He often had a premonition of similar matters,
but what had happened just now completely took him by surprise.
Unless-unless there is a more mysterious inﬂuence at play… Just like
what happened with the suited clown. Klein recalled the scene in his
head and faintly sensed the problem:
Zombie Maynard had been trying to attack the left pocket of his
police uniform!
Left pocket? Klein transferred his black cane to his right palm, then
reached for the pocket with his left hand. He took out the ancient
copper whistle that was inside.
It was a copper whistle carved with many mysterious patterns. It was
the copper whistle used to summon Azik’s messenger.
This copper whistle zombiﬁed Maynard? That’s quite plausible. Even if
Mr. Azik isn’t a descendant of Death, he deﬁnitely has a certain
connection with Death. It’s logical that the objects that he carries with him
would produce such an eﬀect… Klein nodded in thought. He took out a
copper penny and did a quick divination about his conclusion.
As he was at the scene of the incident, holding the relevant objects,
and had ample information, he quickly got a result. He saw the
copper penny fall into his palm, portrait facing up.
This means yes. To think that Mr. Azik didn’t remind me to be cautious
that these things could happen… Well… He’s an amnesiac, so it’s not
uncommon to forget this. Besides, the copper whistle might not have had
negative eﬀects when it was on him. There’s a high possibility that it was
suppressed. I shouldn’t take this copper whistle with me when I’m at
cemeteries or ancient castles, places that are prone to hauntings.
Otherwise, I’ll just be ﬁnding trouble for myself and crazily court death…
Klein silently made a mental note. He then carried the naked
Maynard back onto the bed without much eﬀort.
Looking at the obvious mark on the corpse left behind by the stroke
of the cane, Klein sighed. He covered the corpse with the piece of
white cloth and pretended not to notice.
I’ll leave this problem to the police department to vex over it! Oh, and the
two charms I used just now can be considered mission-related expenses, so
I can get compensated… He thought as he packed up. He then took the
portrait and unlocked the door.
The door opened with a creak and Klein saw Inspector Tolle, who
had been guarding outside, not allowing anyone to come near.
“What happened just now?” Tolle asked in doubt and worry.
He could faintly hear the action going on in the room.
Klein smiled and deliberately said with a little exaggeration,
“Member of Parliament Maynard came back to life and tried to give
me a passionate hug.”
“Don’t joke like that…” Tolle looked into the room in exasperation.
“Why so serious?” Klein said, throwing up his hands. “Due to an
unconﬁrmed reason, Member of Parliament Maynard became a
zombie. Well—the kind of things that would happen in ghost stories.
Fortunately, I hadn’t left yet, so I used ritualistic magic to purify the
desecration, allowing him to return to his eternal slumber.”
“Is this related to his cause of death?” Tolle asked, his expression
stern.
“I cannot give you an answer to that. I don’t even know what the
problem is. You should know that in our ﬁeld, unexplainable things
are a common occurrence,” Klein said. He then looked at the portrait
in his hand, “When I was doing the mediumship ritual, I saw the
scene of Maynard’s death. He was engaging in some activities that
should only be done between a husband and wife with this woman.
And at the climax of his joy, he clutched his chest where the heart
is.”
“You mean that… that is the cause of his death?” Tolle gave him a
“nudge nudge” and “wink wink” look.
“In theory, yes, but you should wait for the autopsy.” Klein handed
the portrait over to Inspector Tolle.
Tolle had only glanced at it when he exclaimed, “Madam Sharon!”
Klein looked at him, lost.
“Is she very famous?”
Yea, judging from her looks and ﬁgure, she should be famous… He
lampooned in his heart.
Tolle looked around and introduced her in a somewhat excited
manner, “Madam Sharon is the prettiest widow in Tingen City. She’s
the most sought-after lady in social settings. She was the second wife
of Baron Khoy, but unfortunately became widowed.
“She is welcomed by many amongst the nouveau riche merchants and
aristocrats, someone who can be invited to banquets by both the
Conservative Party and the New Party.”
“It’s rumored that she and her stepson, the current Baron Khoy, are
on ‘friendly’ terms with many nobles and senior civil servants in
Backlund. She’s a powerful lady. To think that she and Member of
Parliament Maynard had such a relationship… Hehe…”
Simply put, she’s an exceptional socialite… Klein secretly concluded. He
turned around and pointed into the room.
“The next part is not included in my job description. How you
interrogate Madam Sharon is none of my business.”
“Also, I hit Member of Parliament Maynard with a cane before the
puriﬁcation. You’ll have to deal with it and think of an explanation.”
Chapter 174: Madam Sharon
“What?” The bearlike Tolle jumped in shock and looked at Klein
before looking into the room. With agility that wasn’t suited to his
body, he dashed in.
He pulled back the white cloth that covered the corpse and after
examining the body carefully, he heaved a breath of relief.
“It’s better than I imagined. It’s not that serious a problem.”
Maybe I should’ve drawn my revolver and shot Maynard ﬁve times
with demon hunting bullets. Let’s see if you ﬁnd that serious or not…
Klein lampooned inwardly and pointed outside the door.
“That’s all that you need me for, right?”
“No!” Tolle shouted. “Wait a moment.”
Klein asked, puzzled, “Why?”
Tolle explained seriously, “We have to prevent any accidents from
happening. After we talk to Madam Sharon and get her testimony, I’ll
send you back to Zouteland Street.”
If Maynard can resurrect after being dead for ten hours, what else
couldn’t happen? What would I do if you leave? Tolle added in his
head.
“Alright.” Klein massaged his temple and said, “Find a quiet room for
me to rest in then.”
He wasn’t feeling his best in every aspect as he had just advanced a
day ago. Having just performed multiple ritual ceremonies, used two
charms, and suﬀered a nontrivial scare, he needed to enter Cogitation
to eliminate any problems.
Klein was now extremely cautious about losing control.
Tolle covered the dead body with the white cloth again. He obviously
relaxed and replied, “No problem.”
He brought Klein to a guest room that was closer to the sunlit side of
the house. He pointed and said, “Inspector Moretti, don’t worry. No
one will disturb you. I’ll be paying Madam Sharon a visit ﬁrst.”
Klein nodded slightly and watched him walk away. Then, he closed
the door and drew the curtains.
In the dim and silent bedroom, he slowly walked over to the rocking
chair and sat down comfortably. He allowed his body to rock back
and forth rhythmically.
There were countless spherical phantasmal lights overlapping in his
mind. The buzzing sounds in Klein’s ears and the throbbing ache in
his head slowly vanished, bit by bit.
When his situation stabilized, he opened his eyes and looked into the
darkness. He outlined a bed, cupboard, and other furniture. Then, he
calmly thought about his earlier attempts.
There isn’t much feedback from a few exaggerated jokes…
Maybe I have yet to control the powers of the Clown potion, as there
are still remnant negative eﬀects… Of course, I can’t eliminate the
possibility that such “acting” has little eﬀect.
Personally, I’m not quite willing to play the role of a clown. But since
I picked the Sequence pathway, I can only bite the bullet and
continue…
Actually, everyone has to act like a clown at one point or another in
their lives. I don’t have to be so uncomfortable with the idea.
I have to quickly understand a Clown’s core elements…
As various thoughts churned in his mind, Klein suddenly took out a
brass halfpence.
Mostly out of habit, he divined if Maynard’s death was due to
supernatural inﬂuences.
Maybe it’s an occupational hazard… Klein shook his head and
laughed. His eyes grew dark as he recited repeatedly, “John
Maynard’s death was due to supernatural inﬂuences.”
…
Ding!
He ﬂipped the coin as he slouched into the rocking chair. He watched
its brass luster twinkle as it rotated in the air.
Pak! The coin fell right into Klein’s open palm, revealing the number
1∕2 facing up.
A negative answer. In other words, there weren’t any supernatural
inﬂuences involved in John Maynard’s death. I guess that man died
of orgasmic pleasure. The deceased shouldn’t be laughed at, so I
won’t be using an insipid Chinese phrase to mock him… Klein put
away his coin and allowed his thoughts to wander before he nearly
fell asleep.
Knock! Knock! Knock!
Under the slow and rhythmic knocking, Klein tidied his clothing, put
on his policeman’s peak cap, and walked to the door.
Just as his right palm touched the knob, a scene appeared in his
mind.
The bearlike Inspector Tolle was standing outside the door and
pulling his collar. His expression looked disturbed and helpless.
Klein turned the knob and opened the door leisurely.
Inspector Tolle appeared before him as he pulled at his collar.
“Sorry for making you wait so long.
“We’ve already found Madam Sharon and obtained her statement.
You can return to Zouteland Street.
“I’m really sorry for taking up your precious time.”
Klein didn’t ask the reason for his current emotions but he smiled and
said, “Madam Sharon admitted that she was with Maynard last
night?”
“Yes. She said that under the inﬂuence of alcohol, she and Maynard
didn’t manage to control themselves. When she found out that he
died of a heart attack, she was very afraid so she ﬂed the room after
she tidied herself up. She then hid in her own guest room. We don’t
have enough reason to raise charges against her right now, so we had
to let her go while restricting some of her freedom. We’ll have to wait
for the autopsy,” Inspector Tolle explained in detail.
Klein leaned his head sideways and smiled.
“Who are you explaining this to?”
Tolle shook his head and forced a bitter smile. “Oh yeah, I don’t have
to explain it to you. I’m just frustrated by Madam Maynard, and I
started blabbering without realizing it.”
“Maynard’s wife is back?” Klein asked in response.
“Yes, unfortunately. There was something abnormal about the steam
locomotive. It wasn’t late.” Tolle gave an aﬃrmative answer in a
joking manner.
Klein didn’t ask further but checked if he had all his personal
belongings, before following Inspector Tolle down the stairs.
“Why aren’t you arresting her?
“She’s a murderer! I want to sue her, and I want to sue all of you for
negligence of duty!
“I’ll hire the best lawyer to sue you!”
…
Harsh remarks entered Klein’s ears, and he looked over
subconsciously. He saw a voluptuous and fair middle-aged lady
staring angrily across her. Despite having two young men holding her
arms, she continued yelling at them.
A very trendy regal gown in Backlund this year… Having frequently
read the magazine, Ladies Aesthetic, the ﬁrst thought on Klein’s mind
was something unrelated to the situation. He then saw a few
gentlemen protecting a lady behind them.
The lady was in a long black dress with fair smooth skin, waterfall-
like brown hair, and brown eyes. She looked as pitiful as a fawn in
the woods. It made people want to protect her involuntarily.
Madam Sharon… Klein suddenly thought of the “porno” she had
starred in. He quickly lifted his right hand, covered his mouth, and
coughed twice.
Out of habit, he tapped his left molars twice and observed the people
present with Spirit Vision.
There’s some sort of problem with Mrs. Maynard’s body. The colors
of her aura are thinner. From the colors of her emotions, she’s
deﬁnitely feeling anger and hatred, which is consistent with her
outward appearance…
Huh? The color of Madam Sharon’s emotions are shaded in blue,
which represents rational thinking and calmness… This is totally
contrary to her appearance of panic and nervousness. As expected, a
socialite ain’t no innocent bunny… Her body is very healthy.
After examining her, Klein was about to retract his gaze when he
suddenly saw Madam Sharon lift her head and steal a glance in his
direction. Then, she lowered her head again and put on a trembling
trepid look.
If I couldn’t see your emotion colors directly, I might’ve been fooled
by your act… You should consider working as an actress… Klein
lampooned. He didn’t stay any longer and left Maynard’s house with
Inspector Tolle. They took the carriage arranged by the police station
and returned to Zouteland Street.
After taking over the shift from the Captain, he continued to stay on
duty at Chanis Gate. He took the opportunity to write a claims
application.
After an uneventful night, Klein returned upstairs and received the
breakfast that he had requested Rozanne to buy for him.
“I love this pastry!” he complimented.
He had already passed her the money for breakfast ahead of time.
“Really? I can try it tomorrow then!” Rozanne replied happily.
The corner of Klein’s lip twitched as he focused on his battle with the
milk and pastry.
At twenty-ﬁve minutes past eight, he yawned and fought back the
urge to fall asleep, he arrived at the nearby Shooting Club.
He had made an appointment with the asylum doctor, Daxter
Guderian, a few days back.
…
Bang! Bang! Bang!
In the small shooting range, Klein and Daxter aimed at their own
targets and ﬁnished their cylinder of bullets.
Clink! Clank! Daxter ﬂipped and released the empty shells and
examined Klein in interest.
“You’re much more conﬁdent than before.”
Of course, I advanced to Sequence 8. I now possess actual combat
ability… Klein reﬂected on his own facial expression and body
movements in his head and deliberately acted arrogantly.
“Because I only used about a month’s time to master the power of my
potion completely.”
Daxter pouted slightly and said, “Although that is something to be
proud of, there’s no need to say it all the time.”
Hey, as a Spectator, you didn’t see through my performance… From
the looks of it, a Clown has the power to suppress a Spectator’s
ability. Klein smiled at his discovery and asked, “How’s Hood Eugen
recently?”
“… He’s gone insane for real.” Daxter paused and continued, “I
probed him with various methods. He really has gone insane. I’m
considering whether to begin medicating him, to see if I can treat
him.”
As a Sequence 7 Psychiatrist, he actually pretended to be a mental
patient… Even though he was giving treatments to other patients, it
doesn’t align with the core element of the potion’s name. That was an
incorrect way of using the “acting method.” It’s no wonder that he
went insane… Klein thought and said, “Before he went insane, did
you ﬁnd out who got in contact with him?”
“Besides the doctors, patients, nurses, and odd-job workers in the
asylum, there were no outsiders that had contact with him,” Daxter
conﬁdently replied.
Klein brieﬂy acknowledged that as he said, “How about even earlier?
Is there anyone that visited him, or did he leave the asylum regularly
for a period of time?”
In order to follow through with his initial promise, Klein never asked
anything about Hood Eugen in his ﬁrst few meetings.
Daxter fell into deep thought. It took him some time before he said,
“Besides the members of the Psychology Alchemists, there weren’t
any more than ﬁve people that visited him. One of them came thrice.
His name was El.”
Without Klein asking, he continued, “But I heard from Hood Eugen
that El was a pseudonym.
“His real name was Lanevus.”
Chapter 175: Deduction
Lanevus? That criminal who cheated both money and sex? To think that
he had a connection to Hood Eugen from the Psychology Alchemists…
Klein froze for a moment when he heard the name. He immediately
thought about the implications the name “Lanevus” had.
He’s the cheat that escaped with more than 10,000 pounds!
Just a providing a clue would earn me 10 pounds. And if I help in
capturing this moving treasury, I’ll earn 100 pounds!
He’s a scum that took advantage of the bodies and feelings of innocent
women!
To think that he knows Hood Eugen and went to visit him three times at
the mental asylum. Does this mean that he’s connected to the Beyonder
circle, or that he’s a Beyonder himself? Klein suddenly recalled the
name of a potion: the Marauder pathway Sequence 8—Swindler!
These Beyonders took pleasure in swindling others!
It’s very possible! Klein nodded in thought. He controlled his facial
expression and body language, feigning nonchalance as he asked,
“Then, when was Mr. Lanevus’s last visit to Hood Eugen?”
“Early July. I would have to check the registration records of the
mental asylum to give you a speciﬁc date,” Daxter Guderian replied
after a few seconds of thought.
Lanevus’s scam hadn’t been exposed back in early July and he hadn’t left
Tingen…Klein then asked, “Does Hood Eugen mention this person
usually?”
“No. You should understand that a Sequence 7 Psychiatrist would
never reveal something by accident. Every word they say has been
deliberated over thoroughly. It would be impossible to learn their
secrets unless they have some other hidden motives. I was only able
to get the Telepathist formula after Hood Eugen went mad. Oh right,
have you determined the authenticity of the formula?” Daxter
expertly hid his feelings of pride toward his pathway’s potion.
Klein laughed and replied, “It’s authentic. When you need to
advance, you can use that to concoct your potion without worry. We
can help if the Psychology Alchemists are unable to provide you with
the ingredients. Also, how have you been lately?”
“Not too bad. Other than being a little worried about Hood Eugen’s
condition, I feel rather relaxed. I no longer have symptoms of a split
personality. You’ve helped me greatly in this regard,” Daxter
Guderian said, full of emotion.
Klein wore a humble expression.
“It’s only right.”
“Let’s return to the topic at hand. Since you said that a Psychiatrist
would deliberate over their every word before uttering it and
wouldn’t easily reveal their secrets, why did Hood Eugen tell you that
El is Lanevus? Was he hinting at something, or was trying to warn
you of anything?”
Daxter froze for a moment, then creased his brows.
“This is really weird, to think that I didn’t notice this… Other than
that, Hood Eugen didn’t mention anything else. Could his motive be
for me to tell the upper echelons of the association about the name
Lanevus should he meet with any problems?
“The association’s reaction seemed strange, too. After I informed
them about Hood Eugen’s insanity, they did send a liaison. But after I
described every detail, including Lanevus’s name, there were no more
replies from the upper echelons. It was like being a stone cast in the
ocean. Could this mean that they’ve ﬁgured something out?”
“A reasonable deduction.” Klein took out his demon hunting bullets
and stuﬀed them into his revolver, then took aim at the target.
“If we follow this deduction, Hood Eugen might’ve long anticipated
that he would become insane or die… And this has an untenable
connection with Lanevus? But since he already anticipated it, why
didn’t he ask for help from the upper echelons?” Daxter gazed
blankly ahead. He thought hard as he said, “Unfortunately, he’s
insane now. There’s no way to eﬀectively communicate with him
now.”
“Perhaps some kind of temptation made him choose to take the risk.”
Klein made a guess.
At the same time, he felt that it was regrettable that Hood Eugen had
really become a mental patient. This compromised much of the
information that he might have otherwise gotten.
Sigh. Even a dead person is better than a lunatic. I can use mediumship
rituals to make the dead talk, but what can I do with a lunatic? Oh right,
Madam Daly once tried to use mediumship rituals to call upon my lost
memories. The theory behind the mediumship rituals seems to have been
derived from the Psychology Alchemists… This means that I can also use
the mediumship rituals on the living and create a scenario where I interact
with his spirit directly using my spirit… I wonder if Hood Eugen would
still be insane under those conditions.
Unfortunately, I’m not advanced enough in this ﬁeld, so I don’t think I
would be able to do it… I’ll call upon the messenger and ask Madam Daly
about it ﬁrst. I’ll see if she can provide me with any techniques. If she
thinks that only she can accomplish it, then I’ll tell the Captain and get
him to send a telegraph to Backlund to request for assistance…
I’m deﬁnitely not taking this troublesome course of action just because I
want to learn the technique and attempt the ritual to summon the
messenger…
Many thoughts ran through Klein’s mind before he gradually
narrowed it down to a single line of thought that could solve the
problem.
Daxter Guderian approved of his guess.
“Greed always makes one foolish. Even when a person knows that
there’s only the abyss in front of him, he’ll still attempt to walk to the
edge and take a peek.”
This is called crazily testing the limits of fate… Klein lampooned.
“Try your best to treat Hood Eugen after returning to the mental
asylum. Try to keep him sober for a period of time and get some
clues out of him.”
“Also, don’t hide your worries and anxiety. Establish more
connections with the Psychology Alchemists and put pressure on
them to solve Hood Eugen’s problem. That’s the most normal and
reasonable reaction.”
Daxter nodded seriously.
“I’ll try my best.”
Klein didn’t say anymore and, after some deliberation, he asked, “Has
there been any abnormalities with Hood Eugen’s body recently? For
example, thin scales growing on some parts of his body?”
“Near-insanity,” “true insanity,” and “losing control” were all
descriptions of varying levels for a Beyonder when something was
wrong with them. The least severe of the conditions were when their
attitude changed as if they had become a new person, but were still
capable of rational thoughts and actions. That was “near-insanity.”
“Insanity” was more severe in that the person would lose all logic,
becoming a maniac and was diﬃcult to communicate with. Those
that couldn’t be saved were those whose body and mind had become
monsters, completely “losing control.”
Sometimes, if the problem wasn’t dealt with promptly, insanity
would lead to losing control.
Before this, to avoid exposing the informant within the Psychology
Alchemists, Dunn instructed the Nighthawks not to immediately deal
with Hood Eugen. Instead, they switched to surveillance to ensure
that Hood Eugen didn’t lose control. But if there were signs of him
losing control, they would have to deal with him immediately.
Daxter shook his head and let out a bitter laugh.
“No, you can ease your concern. I’m also very afraid that Hood Eugen
will lose control, so I’m paying very close attention to detail. After
all, I’m at the mental asylum six times a week.”
After exchanging a few more words, they left the shooting range ten
minutes apart.
Klein fought back his intense desire to sleep and took a public
carriage back to Daﬀodil Street.
He opened the door and saw his sister sitting on the sofa. She was
neither reading nor was she ﬁddling with machinery parts. She was
just staring blankly ahead as if she had lost her soul.
Tapping his molars gently, Klein activated his Spirit Vision and
asked, puzzled, “Melissa, did something happen?”
She looks healthy based on the colors of her aura, not malnourished like
she was before…
Melissa retracted her gaze and pursed her lips, then looked at the
kitchen which was producing some noise.
“Bella has been recommending the way that her family prepares
breakfast back at home, she said that it’s very delicious. I agreed to
let her try it out this morning.”
“What method is that?” Klein had an ominous feeling.
“Cooking all of the leftovers in a pot, then adding water and bread…”
Melissa repeated softly.
T-this is the standard recipe for food of unknown origins… Klein pinched
his forehead.
“And so?”
“We shouldn’t waste food…” Melissa bit her lips and nodded.
Sis, I feel like you are questioning life… Klein cleared his throat and
suppressed his desire to laugh. He then asked, “Where’s Benson?”
“In the bathroom.” Melissa broke free of her daze, as her eyes
regained their luster.
At that moment, he heard the sounds of ﬂushing from the bathroom.
Benson came out with a newspaper in hand.
“My dear Klein, shall we get you a portion of breakfast?”
“No, I’ve already eaten.” Klein shook his head resolutely, feeling
lucky that he arranged to meet Daxter in the morning. Otherwise, he
wouldn’t have gotten Rozanne to buy breakfast for him.
“How regrettable. Otherwise, you would change your views on my
culinary skills and be ﬁlled with conﬁdence about it.” Benson let out
a self-deprecating laugh.
At this moment, Melissa noticed something. She turned to look at
Klein and said, “You’re back rather late today.”
Sis, be more innocent and lively. Don’t worry about me all the time… The
state you were in just now was great! Klein immediately smiled.
“I have good news.”
“You passed the examination of the police department and can obtain
an increased salary?” Melissa asked without thinking.
Benson also smiled and nodded.
“…” Klein grabbed his hat and stood at the edge of the living room.
He said in amusement, “How am supposed to surprise you guys like
that?”
After that, he added with a dry cough, “Yes, my salary has increased
severalfold.”
He hid his recent increment of four additional pounds a week. He
intended to save up a small piggy bank for himself. After all, he
couldn’t just rely on the money in the unmarked account.
Furthermore, mentioning that his salary had increased severalfold
was enough to scare his siblings.
“Six pounds?” Melissa exclaimed in shock, ﬁnding it bizarre.
“I really need to change my job.” Benson stroked his hairline.
With the information Klein provided him, he had been putting a lot
of eﬀort into his studies.
Without waiting for Klein to speak, Melissa said with a delighted
expression, “In that case, after deducting our normal expenses, you’ll
be able to save up enough money in two or three years to meet the
standards of a marriageable gentleman. Well, it was Elizabeth who
told me about the standards.”
“…” Klein said at a loss, amused, “That’s something to be considered
far into the future. Shouldn’t we celebrate? I hereby announce that
from today on, our staple food shall become white bread. After my
workload decreases, we shall go try out delicacies from diﬀerent
restaurants.”
Melissa glanced at him, and, as though she did not hear what Klein
had said, she said, “Benson and I are attending Mass at the Saint
Selena Cathedral, do you want to come?”
I am praising the Goddess everyday… Klein laughed.
“I need to catch up on sleep.”
He slept until half past twelve in the afternoon. After he had lunch
with Benson and Melissa, he continued on with his mission of
searching all the houses with red chimneys.
When it was late at night, he sealed his room with spirituality and
prepared to try the ritual for summoning Spirit Guide Daly’s
messenger.
Chapter 176: Letter
For Klein, setting up a simple ritual was as easy as breathing. Very
soon, he was done preparing the ingredients, and he lit up the candle
that represented himself.
Looking at the ﬂickering candlelight on the desk, Klein had an
amusing thought for some baﬄing reason.
Would this be considered holding a candlelight vigil in memory of myself?
F**k, what the hell am I thinking!?
…
He reined back his thoughts and picked up the Black Rotten Flower
powder that belonged to the domain of Death and sprinkled it onto
the candle. In return, he caught a whiﬀ of a smell that was akin to
formaldehyde from his previous life.
Immediately after that, he dripped Full Moon Essence Oil, a favored
item of the Evernight.
Amidst a sizzling crackle, his surroundings suddenly became quiet,
and there was a shapeless, magical surge.
Klein took a step back and softly recited in ancient Hermes, “I!”
Then, he changed into Hermes, “I summon in my name.”
“The spirit that wanders about the unfounded, the higher-
dimensional creature that a human orders, the messenger that
belongs to Daly Simone.”
Whoosh!
The wind wailed and the dim candlelight was tainted with a blue
luster.
Under its illumination, the wall behind the desk produced translucent
ripples, and a creepy face surfaced. Other than its mouth, it had no
eyebrows, eyes, or nose.
Its thick lips parted, and a long red tongue was extended. There were
sharp, irregular teeth that lined its mouth. In addition, the tip of the
tongue had ﬁve delicate ﬁngers. They were constantly extending and
retracting, as though they were waiting for a delivery.
This is Daly’s messenger? Compared to Mr. Azik’s, it’s just like a child.
No, I can’t accurately determine their diﬀerences. Yes, one is an adult
Giant, and the other is a human baby… I wonder if it’s due to the magical
item, or if it signiﬁes Mr. Azik’s strength? I have to reevaluate my
understanding of him. Perhaps, he’s a High-Sequence Beyonder…
Crap, I forgot. In the letter, I should’ve asked Madam Daly for the names
of the Sequence 4 and Sequence 3 Corpse Collector pathway. Mr. Azik
most likely belongs to that pathway. Of course, he might’ve not advanced
via potions. Yes, perhaps it’s a gene that’s passed down from his
ancestors… I’ll ask next time, the messenger is waiting…
Klein looked at it seriously for a while and passed the neatly folded
paper into the messenger’s “hand.” Then, he watched as the hand
gripped it tightly.
Whoosh!
The messenger retracted its tongue and swallowed the letter. The
translucent, creepy, and wriggling face shrank back into the wall and
disappeared.
I’ve got to say, this magic is quite cool. Rather convenient too, but it can’t
be spread…Klein looked at the candlelight that had returned to
normal. He shook his head and ended the ritual.
…
Monday morning. Backlund, Empress Borough.
In a hidden corner of the municipal garden built by Duke Negan, Xio
Derecha with her unkempt blond hair and Fors Wall with her languid
bearing were gawking at the liaison before them in a daze. They were
momentarily at a loss at which language to use for a greeting.
The petite Xio, who was slightly over one and a half meters tall,
looked at the golden retriever that had extended its tongue and was
wagging its tail. She smoothed out her trainee knight attire and
weighed her words before she said, “Are you Miss Audrey’s
messenger?
“Oh my Goddess, why am I asking a dog so seriously…”
Fors was holding a thin cigarette with her ﬁngers as she chuckled.
“Maybe it’s a magical creature?”
“I’ve never seen a magical creature that looks so much like a dog…”
Xio replied in all seriousness.
Susie sat down and closed her mouth. She then pointed at her belly
with her paw.
There was a leather pouch tied around the dog’s body amidst her
long golden fur.
Xio looked to her left and right, making sure that there was no one
watching before she quickly moved closer. She bent down and
removed the pouch.
Fors watched curiously when her expression suddenly turned weird.
“It’s made of crocodile skin, and it looks like the work of the fashion
designer, Mr. Sades… She’s actually using such a pouch for the
transaction…”
“… In other words, it’s very expensive?” Xio raised the leather pouch.
Fors pursed her lips tightly and nodded seriously.
Xio instantly lowered her speed in an exaggerated manner. She
carefully opened the zipper and took out the letter inside, as though
she was carrying an antique vase in her hands.
After she read it, she passed the letter to Fors.
Fors burned it with her cigarette after reading it carefully. She
watched as it turned into ashes and scattered onto the soil.
“There’s no extra information provided.” Xio pouted subconsciously.
She took out a neatly folded paper from the pocket of her trainee
knight attire.
She looked at Susie in an imposing manner and exhorted
subconsciously, “This is the investigation report for the past few days.
You must pass this on to Miss Audrey Hall directly.”
Susie quivered and sat up straight, her tail was wagging vigorously.
Xio nodded in satisfaction, stuﬀed the stack of papers into the leather
pouch, and tied it around Susie again.
Susie howled and ran oﬀ very quickly.
…
In the Hall family’s luxurious villa.
Audrey was sitting on the sofa of her own living room. She was
holding a letter opener and was trying to open the letter before her.
It was a letter sent by one of her brothers from the Balam Empire in
the Southern Continent. There was a parcel that came along with the
letter.
At that moment, she saw Susie push open the half-closed door. The
dog dashed over quickly.
Susie sat on the carpet before Audrey and pawed at the leather
pouch.
“You really are an excellent messenger!” Audrey wasn’t stingy with
her compliments.
Susie looked back at the door. It induced vibrations in the air and
said softly, “Your friend is very serious. When I saw her, she
reminded me of the time when a hunter came to train us.”
She had been a complimentary gift when Count Hall bought hunting
dogs.
Susie, your Loen is getting more and more ﬂuent. There are just a few
problems with your logic in using the language… Audrey watched as her
golden retriever took oﬀ the pouch on her own and skillfully pulled
open the zipper.
She gave Susie a look and immediately understood. She stood up and
ran to lock the door.
“… There’s no result so far, but we found that some vagrants
disappeared around the Backlund Bridge borough. Though, we can’t
know for sure that it was Qilangos. Perhaps the vagrants merely
changed their movement patterns suddenly…” Audrey ﬂipped
through the investigation report and seriously wondered how she
should reply to Xio and Fors.
I’ll tell Xio that as long as she can track down Rear Admiral Hurricane,
Qilangos, I’ll buy the Sheriﬀ potion formula for her… No, that’s not
friendly enough. It would make her feel an inferiority complex. Yes, I shall
say, “Xio, I’ve prepared your reward. As long as you can complete the
task, four hundred and ﬁfty pounds will be yours…” Sigh, as far as the
main ingredients for the Telepathist formula, I’ve only found the Farsman
Rabbit’s spinal ﬂuid. I still need the Rainbow Salamander’s pituitary
gland… Glaint, Xio, and Fors have yet to ﬁnd it…
Audrey, cheer up. At least you’ve digested the Spectator potion completely!
Once you put together all the ingredients, you’ll become a Sequence 8
Beyonder!
…
Audrey reined in her thoughts, picked up a pen and paper, and
quickly wrote a reply. She stuﬀed it back into the leather pouch and
entrusted Susie to make another trip.
She watched her golden retriever as she opened the letter that her
brother had sent. She read it with a smile.
“My dear sister,
“I think you should come to the Southern Continent too. Come over
to the colonized regions of the Balam Empire. There’s abundant
sunlight, fresh air, a clean environment, freshly caught seafood,
various unique cultures, and the very kind and obedient Balam
people who make good servants, as well as the smell of freedom.
“On the contrary, Backlund is cold and moist, the air is bad, there’s
always dust, and it’s always gloomy. Plus, it’s highly populated which
leads to all sorts of problems. Hmm, and the endless balls, banquets,
and salons… The social events are so boring and insipid that I
wouldn’t want to stay for a minute. Dear sister, I believe you share
the same feeling.
“I’m not running away from home. I’m merely seeking my own place
in life, but our brother deﬁnitely doesn’t think so. He’s always been a
selﬁsh person. Of course, he wouldn’t be stingy with you, because
you can only claim a tiny part of the family wealth, while I would be
his biggest competition in the ﬁght for the inheritance within the
ranks of nobles. After all, our father is a Duke who takes a long view.
He deﬁnitely wouldn’t be restrained by the rule that the eldest sibling
will inherit the rank of nobility.
“As long as he feels that it’s necessary, he would do anything. Just
like when he sold oﬀ half the farmland and pastures to enter the
banking industry, regardless of the strong opposition.
“I miss Backlund sometimes, mostly Father, Mother, and you. I miss
the smile that you put on my face during those few years. You
must’ve become the most dazzling gem in Backlund, but
unfortunately, I’ll only be able to return after two years. A career is a
man’s pride, while the outstanding young people in the Loen
Kingdom treat the world as their stage.”
…
“You can tell our dear aunt that the coastal regions in the Balam
Empire are very suitable for vacations, and especially suitable for her,
given how her joints ache and swell in the winter. I sincerely invite
her to be my guest. If you can come with her, that would be even
better.”
…
“I didn’t send you too many gifts. They’re mainly things that are rich
with the traditions and styles of Balam, such as the unique yellow
silk, and the ornaments that are ﬁlled with traits related to the
worship of Death.
“I remembered that you loved things regarding mysticism so I’ll look
around for you. The culture here is full of mystery.”
…
After reading the letter, Audrey picked up a pen, paper, and writing
board. She leaned back into the sofa, pursed her lips and wrote
seriously, “My dearest Alfred,
“Although it has been less than a year, the little girl in your
memories has grown up. I don’t like mysticism anymore, so you don’t
have to search for those kinds of things.”
Because it’s very dangerous… Audrey puﬀed up her cheeks and added
in her head.
She had heard of too many tragedies related to mysterious objects
when participating in Beyonder Gatherings and from stories Xio and
Fors recounted.
She thought and declared excitedly, “I’m now interested in biology.
Recently, I’ve been in awe of the Rainbow Salamander. Can you ask
around for me and ﬁnd out where I can ﬁnd one of these creatures,
or if they have a complete corpse that has been preserved?”
Chapter 177: Sudden Turn of
Events
Audrey stopped writing after she ﬁnished sharing some interesting
news and scandals about aristocrats. She then adopted a serious pose
as she recalled something.
With her exceptional memory as a Spectator, she arranged the
information that she had received from her father’s teachings, as well
as the news she heard during banquets and salons into paragraphs.
After creating a draft in her head, Audrey penned, “As for the
political situation in Backlund you asked about, it’s not within my
area of interest. I can describe it to you only based on my own
impressions and the details that I happen to know.
“Some time ago, Father told me that after the abolishment of the
Grain Act, the prices of crops were declining rapidly. The rent of
farmland and pastures were also plunging, but I don’t know the exact
magnitude. I can only explain it to you with this example.
“As you know, Duke Negan is an aristocrat who owns the most land
outside of the royal family. It’s said that he owns more than
12,000,000 pounds worth of farmland, pastures, and forests. Last
year, his land earned him a historic 1,300,000 pounds in rent. But
this year, it’s forecast that his rent will only be 850,000 pounds, a
whole 450,000 pounds less. That’s more than the entirety of the
assets that I’m entitled to.
“Without any further explanation from me, I’m sure that my dear
brother will understand the behavior of most old-fashioned nobles.
They’re proud of being landowners, and their income is derived
mostly from rent. They place a heavy emphasis on their appearance
and would maintain their current lifestyle even if they have to go
into debt. They spend tens of thousands of pounds on the upkeep of
their castles each year, many more thousands on clothes and jewelry,
as well as their persistent hunting activities, social banquets, and the
occasional lavish weddings and funerals, etc, etc.
“With the decrease in rent, according to my knowledge, a good
portion of the nobles have met with ﬁnancial diﬃculties. Because of
this, Count Wolfe has sold 84,000 ares of land in the countryside and
gotten 29,000 pounds in return. Viscount Conrad has also sold his art
collection worth 55,000 pounds to a national art gallery.
“Other than a few visionary nobles who had long shifted their focus
to steel, coal, railroads, banks, and rubber industries, the rest of the
nobles have been severely aﬀected by the Grain Act. Let us praise our
dear Count Hall!
“Father told me that the ﬁnancial distress will loosen the control the
nobles have over politics. As you can imagine, the number of
ministers with blue blood will decline from the next year onward.
“In a bid to secure funding, the Conservative Party and the New Party
have promised to confer upon anyone the noble titles as long as they
donate a suﬃcient amount of money and lack any criminal records.
Of course, the caveat is that the person who donated the money must
own an amount of land beﬁtting of a noble.
“One example is the rich Mr. Syndras. He purchased the lowest area
of land expected of a baron, 60,000 ares, then donated 100,000
pounds to the Carleton Club and 400,000 pounds to the Conservative
Party, and donations to charity amounting to 300,000 pounds.
Finally, he succeeded in receiving conferment from His Majesty and
became a highly-regarded baron. I’ve heard that there’s a price list to
this, 300,000 pounds to become a baron and 700,000 to 1,000,000
pounds for a hereditary baron. There is no clear price for the title of
viscount or count, but I’m sure those are suﬃciently ridiculous.”
…
“This year, many nobles who are facing ﬁnancial diﬃculties are
starting to seriously consider the possibility of marriages with
wealthy merchants. There have already been three marriages like this
over the last two months. The betrothal gifts the noble women
received are something to be envied.
“Also, the workers who protested the Grain Act did experience a
decrease in the cost of living, but the quality of their lives has not
improved. Instead, it seems to have deteriorated as the bankrupt
farmers have entered the city and stolen their jobs by requesting
lower wages. Thus, the wages of the laborers are dropping rapidly.
“I remember the day when Father asked me who I felt was the
winner of the Grain Act.
“My dear Alfred, you must know the answer. You would deﬁnitely be
able to obtain a hereditary baron title through your own eﬀorts.”
…
Xio Derecha and Fors Wall were returning to the Backlund Bridge
borough after they received Audrey’s reply.
Xio, with her messy blonde hair, was looking out the window of the
carriage, her eyes were bright like two burning balls of ﬂame.
She muttered the term “450 pounds” to herself repeatedly, as if
reciting an incantation. Her strength and courage grew every time
she repeated the term.
“Darkholme hasn’t reported the status of the investigation today.
Let’s make a trip to his house!” Xio suddenly turned to look at Fors.
Darkholme was the leader of a triad in the Backlund East Borough
and had control over many beggars and thieves.
Even though he looked very friendly with his chubby face that was
perpetually adorned with a warm and amiable smile—Xio knew that
he was a merciless scoundrel. He once broke the arm of a thirteen-
year-old thief because the boy had hidden his proﬁt.
Unless it was necessary, Xio was unwilling to meet Darkholme, but
Darkholme was one of the few people who were most familiar with
the vagrants in the city.
Fors pushed her slightly curly hair back behind her ear.
“As long as it doesn’t delay my lunch.”
“No problem! Perhaps I could treat you to an Intis feast after this
week!” Xio promised in complacency.
“Must I thank God?” Fors asked as she laughed.
Unlike Xio, Fors was a moderate believer of the God of Steam and
Machinery.
As they conversed, the two ladies switched to another public carriage
and arrived at the Backlund East Borough, and arrived at
Darkholme’s house.
It was a terrace house located in a narrow alley. There were green
plants hanging from the walls, the exterior looked relatively
unkempt.
Xio walked to the door, raised her right hand and knocked in a
unique rhythm.
The unlocked door opened with a creak following her knocks.
Xio’s apparently confused expression immediately turned stern, like a
wary lion’s.
She took out a bayonet she carried with her and cautiously pushed
open the door. She then slowly stepped inside.
Fors also stopped looking nonchalant, having produced a dagger of
unknown origins.
They didn’t smell any peculiar scents, but their rich experience told
them that something was oﬀ.
One step, two steps, three steps. Xio and Fors entered Darkholme’s
house.
Then they saw a pale limb on a gas lamp, internal organs on a coﬀee
table, as well as strips upon strips of ﬂesh strewn on the ﬂoor and
hung on the clothes rack!
Pieces of bone had been stripped clean and piled up near the door.
And amongst the bones was a head, its vacant eyes open. It was none
other than Darkholme.
His chubby face still maintained the amiable smile, as if everything
was normal. Furthermore, there was no stench of blood in the house.
As a former clinical doctor before becoming a best-selling author and
Sequence 9 Beyonder, Fors has seen many death scenes more
disgusting than this. She patted the tense Xio, who was on the brink
of vomiting, as she surveyed the surroundings.
“Qilangos? Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos?”
“He realized that Darkholme was investigating the missing vagrants
and tracked him back to his house?”
“Or could it be said that Darkholme had tracked him down, but
ended up being caught?”
Xio fought back the urge to retch and said with a serious expression,
“He sure lives up to his name as a merciless and crafty pirate admiral.
The strangeness here also ﬁts the description of his treasure.”
“Crafty…” Fors was suddenly alarmed as she blurted out, “Could he
be waiting nearby in an ambush against the mastermind behind the
investigations?”
Xio froze for a moment before answering in a ﬂuster, “That’s highly
likely!”
He was a Sequence 6 Wind-blessed, a powerful pirate with a mystical
artifact, while they were just two Sequence 9’s!
This was an extremely simple and easy contrast!
…
In the house opposite Darkholme’s house, a man with a unique broad
chin and dark green eyes in his thirties was standing by the window,
coldly observing Xio’s and Fors’s opening of the door and slow entry.
He was none other than Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos!
The black glove on his left hand twitched as if it were alive. A layer
of dull gold scales appeared on its surface.
Qilangos revealed a cruel and joyous expression as his dark green
eyes turned pale gold and indiﬀerent.
…
The moment Fors realized this, she dragged Xio to the other side and
avoided the area just across the main door.
She then gritted her pearly-white teeth and took out a bracelet that
was hidden by her sleeves.
This silver bracelet had three dark green, coarse stones which showed
signs of burn marks and were rough and uneven.
Fors pulled out one of the stones and let out a low growl in ancient
Hermes, “Door!”
She grabbed onto Xio Derecha tightly as the stone released a faint
blue glow.
The ﬁgures of the two ladies turned indistinct, nearly invisible.
They saw many forms they found diﬃcult to describe. There were
even transparent objects that didn’t seem to exist. They saw diﬀerent
colors, lustrous splendors which seemed to possess immense
knowledge. They had entered the mysterious spirit world.
In this strange world that stood distinct from reality, Fors proceeded
in a particular direction while pulling Xio along.
Seconds later, they exited their indistinct states and returned to
reality—to Backlund.
But they were no longer at Darkholme’s house, but instead arrived at
an empty cemetery.
…
Qilangos, who was wearing his scaled glove, silently appeared at the
door of Darkholme’s house. He swept the interior with his cold gaze.
He froze for a moment, then creased his brows as he muttered to
himself, “Traveler?”
…
In the cemetery.
“What are we going to do next?” Fors panted, sensing their
predicament and feeling a lingering sense of fear.
The bracelet was a mystical item she had received along with the
formula for Apprentice and its corresponding materials back during a
fortuitous encounter of hers. Other than causing her to hear strange,
faint murmurings during the full moon every month, it posed no
threat.
There were originally ﬁve stones on the bracelet, each stone allowing
her to traverse through the spirit world, technically allowing her to
teleport. But now, there were only two stones left.
Xio calmed herself down and nodded solemnly.
“First notify Miss Audrey, then-then we call the police!”
Chapter 178: The Subsequent
Ideas
“Call the police?” Fors Wall repeated in surprise.
To Beyonders, lodging a police report seemed to be something of
another world.
Xio paced back and forth as she tugged her coarse blonde hair.
“The scene of Darkholme’s death is harrowing and creepy. As long as
the police aren’t blind, they would deﬁnitely pass the case on to the
Mandated Punishers, the Nighthawks, the Machinery Hivemind, or
the special department of the military. When that happens, we can
leak some more information and let them know that the murderer is
Qilangos. At that point, the entire city will be chasing after him.
“Our goal is only to look for Qilangos, not to capture him. With the
‘help’ of so many Beyonders, things would become much simpler and
safer. Once Qilangos panics and makes a mistake, it would be our
chance to claim our bounty. Heh heh, I’m referring to the discovery
of his whereabouts.”
Xio laughed dryly and looked at the appalled Fors.
“Do you think that the only way I know to deal with problems is by
charging into them headﬁrst? The diﬀerence between us and
Qilangos is as vast as the Desi Bay.”
Fors nodded slowly and said, “Your understanding of yourself is
absolutely right. You’ve done too many things of a similar nature.
Hence, the losses that you’ve suﬀered is suﬃcient for you to advance
to Sequence 8.
“Luckily, you’re still rational enough regarding this matter.”
Xio lowered her head to look at her bayonet. She thought for a
moment and said, “… I have to be honest. I clearly sensed the
approach of Death earlier. Qilangos was no doubt nearby. That was
an aura evil enough to destroy us at any time. That triggered an
instinctual response in me.”
Fors wore her silver bracelet that had two stones left and thought
seriously.
“I agree with your idea. Let’s inform Miss Audrey ﬁrst and lodge the
police report after.”
“Yes, regardless if it was Darkholme or his underlings who found
Qilangos’s traces, we could continue to investigate with that
approach and ﬁnd out Qilangos activity range and the location of his
residence.”
Xio creased her slim blonde eyebrows and said, “But Qilangos would
deﬁnitely not remain in the same place.”
Even as one of the Seven Pirate Admirals, even if he had the
assistance of a mystical artifact, Qilangos had to be extremely careful
in Backlund.
Even Nast, the King of the Five Seas, had once encountered disaster
here and was nearly caught.
“No, what I meant was, to surmise or conﬁrm the purpose of
Qilangos’s visit to Backlund based on the clues. Once we know what
he’s trying to do, no matter how he disguises himself or what tricks
he pulls, he’ll be exposed to us in the end. Then, our mission would
be accomplished,” Fors explained in detail. “Two years of novel-
writing experience tells me that things would become simple once we
grasp the crux of the matter.”
Xio looked at her best friend in shock. She couldn’t believe the
woman had just made such a logical statement.
“I’m diﬀerent from you. I’m merely too lazy to think, while you think
with your muscles.” Fors pursed her lips, leaned her head sideways,
and smiled.
“Teasing me doesn’t make you smarter…” Xio tried to smooth out her
few strands of blonde hair that was sticking out. “Alright, let’s head
over to Empress Borough and tell Miss Audrey about this.”
Fors nodded faintly and said, “So, what’s our emergency contact
method with Miss Audrey?”
Xio was momentarily put at a loss. She looked afar at the tombstone
as she said, “She told me that pet dog of hers we saw earlier walks
herself at least ﬁve times a day. Well, the next walk should be after
lunch.”
“In other words, we have to loiter around suspiciously outside Count
Hall’s luxurious manor?” The corner of Fors’s lips twitched.
Xio suddenly looked sideways and revealed an obsequious smile,
“Fors, or would you prefer to just sneak in?
“I don’t think that would be diﬃcult for you. It’s what you’re good
at.”
“A hereditary count for centuries, one of the most inﬂuential
parliament members in the House of Lords, the largest shareholder of
Varvat Bank, the fourth largest shareholder of Backlund Bank, the
special consultant of the Royal Bank of Loen, the third largest
shareholder of Suchit Bank in the Intis Republic, the second largest
shareholder of Constant Coal and Steel Consortium, and so on. These
are the titles of Miss Audrey’s father. Xio, use your brain; how could
a man like that not employ any Beyonders? Would he not have any
prized collections? This is diﬀerent from those destitute viscounts and
barons!” Fors replied in exasperation. “I swear in the name of God, if
I were to sneak in, I would be discovered and caught within ﬁve
minutes.”
Xio nodded continuously in agreement.
“Let’s wait for the golden retriever then…”
With that said, she led the way. After she took a few steps forward,
she spoke with her back facing Fors, “Uh, well, I will compensate you
for your losses and the damages in the future. I’m referring to the
stone, of course.”
Listening to that, the corner of Fors’s lips lifted and she said, “I was
saving myself.
“And, Xio, you’re going the wrong way!
“God, if you were an Apprentice and ended up becoming a Traveler
in the future, it would be a disaster!”
…
Outside Count Hall’s luxurious manor.
Xio and Fors hid behind an Intis parasol tree and secretly observed
their target building in silence, watching the people walking to and
fro.
After God knows how long, they ﬁnally saw the golden retriever
come out from a hidden hole under the wall. It pricked up its ears
and looked to its left and right, appearing very cautious.
Just as Susie started taking its walk happily, a black male dog popped
up from nowhere. It fawned on Susie and started running around in
circles.
“This is the ﬁrst time I’m seeing a dog show such a humanlike
reaction. Just how much does it hate that black dog?” Xio sighed.
She could tell from Susie’s gaze and facial expression that there was
obvious detest.
Fors smiled and said, “It’s just like encountering a rash, disgusting,
and persistent lecher.”
Seeing Susie attempt to speed up to escape the black dog’s pursuit,
Xio stood up do administer “Justice.”
“My ruling is for you to leave her alone!” Xio shouted with a mask of
solemnity.
The black dog was taken aback and immediately scampered away
with its tail between its legs.
Susie let out a breath of relief and slowed down. It barked politely
and wagged its tail.
That was close, I nearly said “Thank you” to them… The golden
retriever thought in joy.
That would’ve been a very awkward situation…
…
A melodic tune slowly came to a halt as Audrey picked up the latest
intelligence Xio and Fors had delivered and read it with knitted
brows.
She closed the piano cover and stood up elegantly. She paced back
and forth in her piano room and considered her next course of action.
Qilangos is a very dangerous man… If Xio and Fors continued
investigating, they might end up in danger… It might even expose
me… Yes, I should just proceed according to their suggestion. Oh
yeah, it’s another two hours until the Tarot Club. I wonder what Mr.
Fool would suggest? If he’s still not interested, I’ll discuss it with The
Hanged Man carefully… Audrey gradually calmed herself down.
This was the ﬁrst time she had encountered, or perhaps was
described as being placed in such a perilous situation. There was
already one death!
Three in the afternoon.
Audrey’s vision recovered from a crimson and blurry state before
seeing the boundless gray fog that didn’t belong to reality, the lofty
palace that looked like the home of a giant, the long ancient mottled
bronze table, and The Fool who was always engulfed by a thick layer
of fog. Lastly, she saw The Hanged Man and The Sun.
At that moment, Audrey’s tense and anxious emotions seemed to
relax—she felt so safe, so calm.
I’m participating in the Tarot Club that doesn’t belong in the material
world, and I’m dealing with Mr. Fool who’s nearly a god. Qilangos
and I are on diﬀerent levels…Audrey sat in an upright position
proudly. She lifted her chin slightly and greeted cheerfully, “Good
afternoon, Mr. Fool! Good afternoon, Mr. Hanged Man! Good
afternoon, Mr. Sun!”
After they greeted one another, Klein saw that Miss Justice was
indicating her desire to speak; therefore, he nodded faintly to express
his permission.
“Honorable Mr. Fool, I wonder if your adorer has received the
compensation of 300 pounds?” Audrey asked, holding back her urge
to talk about Qilangos while she showed concern over her leader’s
adorer.
Klein smiled and said, “I didn’t pay close attention to this matter. But
as my adorer didn’t request for additional help, I suppose he has
already received it.”
Yes, I’ve checked multiple times. There are 300 pounds lying in my
anonymous bank account… Klein added in his head happily.
“That’s great!” Audrey relaxed and looked across her. “Mr. Hanged
Man, there’s been progress regarding Qilangos.”
Alger suddenly sat up straight. He couldn’t hide his excitement as he
asked, “Where is he?”
“Unfortunately, he noticed our investigations just after we discovered
his tracks. He killed one of the personnel involved.” Audrey repeated
the highlights of Xio’s and Fors’s story and explained their follow-up
plan in detail.
Alger nodded faintly and said, “I’ll pay close attention.”
Then, he turned to the side and looked towards the seat of honor at
the long bronze table. Under the vacant gaze of The Sun, Derrick,
who listened but didn’t understand anything, he said, “Honorable Mr.
Fool, if I were to ﬁnd out Qilangos’ true intention and the very
important and magical item that he intends to obtain, please allow
me to recite your name and inform you through the ritual.”
He didn’t repeat his request for The Fool’s adorer to provide him
assistance. As he brought it up before and The Fool had given his
answer, there was no need to harp on the topic. Otherwise, it might
provoke the god.
Hence, Alger made it clear that his intention was only to report his
ﬁndings.
If the ﬁnal temptation was suﬃcient, he believed that Mr. Fool’s
adorer would deﬁnitely appear.
That works? Audrey widened her eyes.
I should’ve asked for the right to report as well. I might be able to
gain Mr. Fool’s guidance occasionally… She thought with regret.
Under everyone’s gaze, Klein leaned back into his chair and nodded
faintly. He replied slowly, “You may.”
Chapter 179: Praising Mr. Fool
Alger heaved a sigh of relief when he heard The Fool’s answer. He
lowered his head and humbly said, “Please allow me to thank you in
advance.”
That’s because I’m also curious… curious about the item Qilangos is
searching for. I want to know about the item that can allow a Sequence 6
Wind-blessed to have the strength of a Sequence 4… I’m also curious
about what a pirate admiral is going to do in Backlund… Klein smiled,
maintaining his profound posture.
It’s not like I’ve promised to provide assistance after I hear your prayers!
He emphasized in his heart.
But now, he was a lot more conﬁdent than before. Now, he had
actual allies and the mysterious Mr. Azik who was currently in
Backlund.
If it was absolutely necessary, Klein was willing to use the bronze
whistle to enlist the help of Azik. Of course, he deﬁnitely wouldn’t
mention the Tarot Club. He would probably say he got information
from some random source.
There were still two problems that existed in this matter. First, Klein
was only limited to a cooperative relationship with Azik. It wasn’t
necessarily the case that Azik would provide assistance unless he was
interested in what Qilangos was doing or the mystical item that he
was after.
Second, Klein was unsure of just how powerful Azik was. Even if he
had made the assumption that Azik was a High-Sequence Beyonder,
he had to consider the fact that his memory loss might have
weakened his abilities. After all, knowledge was usually equated with
power, and the lack of knowledge would deﬁnitely diminish Azik’s
power.
If that was the case, Klein couldn’t guarantee that Azik could deal
with Qilangos, especially with the latter wielding the Creeping
Hunger. Klein was afraid that he would be placing Azik in danger so
he was unwilling to trouble Azik unless he absolutely had to.
Now that I think about it, Mr. Azik’s terrifying messenger can be
summoned with the bronze whistle… No, that thing doesn’t look like a
messenger at all; it could take the role of an evil boss! So, even if Mr. Azik
cannot beat the Creeping Hunger augmented Qilangos, he should be able
to defend himself easily and have enough power left to save The Hanged
Man, Miss Justice, and her partners… Klein shifted his posture as he
thought, still leaning against the back of his chair. He propped his
right leg over his left.
The Hanged Man Alger looked at The Fool and spoke once again,
“I’m about to receive a batch of pages from Emperor Roselle’s diary. I
believe that I can present them to you in the next gathering, or the
gathering after that.”
According to the arrangement of the Church of the Lord of Storms,
Pritz Harbor was under the jurisdiction of the Backlund diocese.
Thus, Alger could enter the capital and wait for Rear Admiral
Hurricane Qilangos to show himself under the guise of reporting
about his previous voyage.
Backlund had been the headquarters of the Church of the Lord of
Storms until the end of the last epoch, having shifted their holy altar
to Pasu Island only after the establishment of the Loen Kingdom.
Regardless, the status of the Church of the Lord of Storms in
Backlund was second only to the headquarters of the Seven Great
Churches. One could imagine the information the Church of the Lord
of Storms held.
Under these circumstances, Alger was conﬁdent that he would be
able to collect pages of Emperor Roselle’s diary in the name of
research. After all, they were indecipherable at present.
Klein allowed joy to color his tone, as he said with a gentle nod,
“Very good.”
What he was really feeling right now was a mix of joy and worry. He
was happy that he could see several pages of Emperor Roselle’s diary
soon. They might contain a lot of useful information, but he was also
worried about what he had to give The Hanged Man in return. After
all, no one knew if The Hanged Man would be interested in the
contents of the diary, or if the content was valuable enough.
Even a Seer is unable to determine that in advance… Must I really let my
“adorer” help him? Klein gave a silent sigh.
Audrey Hall hurriedly spoke up when she saw the conversation
between The Hanged Man and The Fool end.
“Honorable Mr. Fool, may I recite your name and inform you using a
ritual should I receive any timely and useful information?”
Timely… Look, Miss Justice’s choice of words is so reﬁned. Compared to
her, you are too vulgar, The Hanged Man! Klein nodded slightly, saying
past the fog, “You may.”
Great! Audrey secretly clenched her ﬁsts.
At the same time, Klein turned to look at The Sun, Derrick Berg, who
had been silently listening to their conversations. He spoke, his tone
was peaceful, “The same goes for you as well.”
“Yes, Mr. Fool.” Derrick lowered his head.
The majestic palace was silent for a few seconds before Audrey spoke,
“I need the complete pituitary gland of a Rainbow Salamander.”
One of the main ingredients of the Telepathist potion? Hanged Man Alger
nodded slightly as if he was contemplating.
“I don’t have it. To be honest, I’ve only seen this creature in
textbooks.” The Sun, Derrick, heard the term automatically translated
to him as Phantom Netherdrake.
What kind of textbook would discuss a supernatural creature? How
envious… I can only get information like that at a Beyonder gathering,
through word of mouth, or through a crumpled piece of paper. There’s no
system in place, and my search for knowledge lacks organization… I’ll
ﬁnd a way to trade for the Sun’s textbook in the future! Oh, he was
interested in the formula for the Bard potion… Audrey thought, a little
envious.
At that moment, Alger looked at The Fool, then retracted his gaze. He
then looked opposite him and said in thought, “I might have a way of
obtaining the complete pituitary gland of the Rainbow Salamander.”
Without waiting for Audrey to speak, he added on, “But it’s under the
premise that Qilangos is found. When the time comes, the complete
pituitary gland of the Rainbow Salamander would be equivalent to
the extra compensation that I owe you. Miss Justice, you might not
know, but these creatures are nearly extinct, and we can only ﬁnd
traces of them in primitive islands in the Sea of Fog, the Berserk Sea,
or the Sonia Sea. Not many people have the coordinates to these
Islands. Heh, if you’re interested, we can make a deal, for I am one of
the few who knows how to get there.”
I’m also interested in those primitive islands… Klein silently listened to
their conversation.
Thinking about the extinction of the Rainbow Salamander, he
suddenly recalled the joke he cracked with Old Neil—the Dragons
and Giants Protection Association. He let out a sigh in his heart.
Audrey became thrilled after hearing that. She fought back her
emotions as she said, “I once dreamed of going on a voyage in search
of these primitive islands to take in the history.”
My Goddess, the Tarot Club is too powerful, too wonderful! To be able to
recruit a member who has the coordinates of the primitive islands! Praise
Mr. Fool! Audrey couldn’t maintain her Spectator state as a smile
crept across her face.
Primitive islands? Klein froze for a moment, then thought about a page
of Emperor Roselle’s diary that he had seen, the one where the
Emperor described himself as a pirate king!
He said that he discovered an unnamed island with many
supernatural creatures when he and his Four Horsemen of the
Apocalypse were traversing the Sea of Fog on an unsafe sea route.
Could that be the so-called primitive island? How unfortunate, the Great
Emperor didn’t include any coordinates in his diary. Perhaps the
information will be in some future pages, but as of now, I haven’t received
any pages of his diary in chronological order… Klein was ﬁlled with
regret and anticipation.
The Sun Derrick was already confused by the terms “Sea of
Fog,””Berserk Sea,””Sonia Sea,””primitive island,” etc.
He felt more and more certain that Miss Justice and Mr. Hanged Man
belonged to a diﬀerent world than he did.
After collecting herself for a few seconds, Audrey asked curiously,
“Does the near-extinction of the Rainbow Salamander mean that the
Spectator pathway will be severed soon?”
“No, there will deﬁnitely be substitute materials.” Alger gave a
deﬁnite answer.
“What substitute materials are there?” Audrey’s eyes brightened as
she asked.
Alger shook his head, replying without revealing certain profound
truths, “I don’t know. Perhaps the members of the Psychology
Alchemists might know.”
“Then how can you be so sure that there will be substitute
ingredients?” Audrey didn’t understand.
Alger laughed and said, “You will understand in time. Or do you have
something to trade for the information right now?”
“I guess I’ll wait.” Audrey pouted and sighed. She also dismissed the
idea of asking Mr. Fool.
There’s no use in me knowing for the time being… The Hanged Man will
deﬁnitely ask about something regarding Rear Admiral Hurricane, and I
cannot be dragged too deep into that matter… She suddenly felt like
praising her intellect.
But what she never expected was that Mr. Fool was feeling very
disappointed at that moment.
Klein was rather curious about the secrets which Alger’s words held.
Unfortunately, Miss Justice, who was the best assist all this while,
didn’t choose to go through with the transaction.
No matter what method they chose to perform a transaction, the
contents of the deal couldn’t be hidden from the owner of the fog!
Well, even if the Rainbow Salamander is nearing extinction, the
Psychology Alchemists are still giving out formulas listing it as an
ingredient instead of providing a substitute. Does this mean that the
Psychology Alchemists are in possession of the coordinates of certain
primitive islands? Or could they be working together with an organization
that has the coordinates? Klein wondered.
After the end of the transaction discussions, Klein looked around,
then turned to The Sun. He asked in a gentle tone, “Does the City of
Silver still believe in gods?”
Klein was merely an oﬃcial member of the Nighthawks and had no
access to deeper mysticism knowledge. An example would be
sacriﬁcial rituals. Thus, in order to reﬁne his understanding of
performing sacriﬁcing dedicated to himself, to move materials in the
mysterious space above the gray fog, as a Sequence 8, Klein needed
to learn it as soon as possible from other sources.
He came up with three methods after continuous consideration: First,
he was going to ask Spirit Guide Daly, who was adept at ritualistic
magic whilst also being a deacon. But this might invite suspicion
from her; thus, Klein could only patiently wait for an opportunity.
Second, he could ask Mr. Azik, but Klein couldn’t guarantee that he
would be able to recall the knowledge in this area. Third, he was
going to use a roundabout way to ask Sun, who lived in the City of
Silver.
Klein already had an idea of how he was going to do it while
eﬀectively maintaining his image.
Whatever he asked would be tied to the gods!
Derrick replied in a respectful tone, “We still believe in the Lord that
created everything, the omnipotent and omniscient God.”
Chapter 180: A Smart Person
Always Overthinks
Upon hearing The Fool’s question, Audrey perked up her ears and
entered her Spectator state. She waited for The Sun to answer.
She had always been curious about where the City of Silver was and
what was so special about that place, but she couldn’t bring herself to
ask. It touched upon his privacy after all.
At that moment, Mr. Fool was asking personally. It was like ﬁnishing
the ﬁrst volume of an outstanding detective novel she had been
reading for a long time, and she ﬁnally had the chance to buy the
next volume!
The Sun’s answer didn’t disappoint her. They didn’t believe in the
mainstream seven orthodox deities, nor did they believe in Death as
the Southern Continent did. They also didn’t believe in the hidden
existences, evil gods or devils—Primordial Demoness, Hidden Sage,
Dark Side of the Universe, Chained God, or the True Creator—which
The Hanged Man had told her before.
The City of Silver is really special! They actually worship the Creator
Himself! This is the primordial worship that Mr. Hanged Man
described, right? Hmm, the description of omnipotence is a little
strange… Audrey stole a glance at The Hanged Man subconsciously
and realized that he was nodding slightly.
Klein wasn’t surprised at all. He purposely chuckled and asked in
reply, “Even though He abandoned you?”
Abandoned? The Creator abandoned the City of Silver? Alger was
shocked. Suddenly when he suddenly made the connection regarding
a particular term.
The Forsaken Land of the Gods!
In the conﬁdential information of the Church of the Lord of Storms,
at the security clearance level that Alger, who was Captain—
equivalent to the Bishop level—could access, the Forsaken Land of
the Gods had always only been a name with no actual description.
However, it clearly pointed towards the end of the Sonia Sea. From
what he knew, even the Cardinals at the core of the church had no
idea what the Forsaken Land of the Gods represented. But only the
leader of the church, the Proxy of the Lord of Storms, knew
something about the situation and seemed to be taking charge of the
hidden mission to look for the Forsaken Land of the Gods.
Alger had once made a bold guess when he equated the True
Creator’s holy residence which was promoted by the Aurora Order
with the Forsaken Land of the Gods. But, unfortunately, The Fool
hadn’t conﬁrmed his guess, so he couldn’t be sure.
Now, he was shocked and surprised to ﬁnd that the Tarot Club
member using The Sun as his code name was very likely from the
Forsaken Land of the Gods!
Mr. Fool knew where the Forsaken Land of the Gods was all this
time, and he could pull someone from there to be a member of the
Gathering! This is a hidden place that the Church of the Lord of
Storms has been trying to ﬁnd to no avail!
Alger looked at The Fool who was seated in the seat of honor at the
end of the ancient long bronze table in horror. He could only see that
he was leaning back in his chair in silence, engulfed by the thick fog.
Audrey wasn’t particularly moved about it. The only time that she
had heard about the Forsaken Land of the Gods was from The
Hanged Man’s question. She wasn’t particularly interested, so she
failed to associate it to anything from what Mr. Fool said earlier.
The City of Silver has the legend about being abandoned by the
Creator… Huh, Mr. Hanged Man seems to be deeply aﬀected… What
is he amazed and afraid of? Audrey nodded in puzzlement as she
remembered the details of the moment.
“Yes, we believe that we will regain the Lord’s favor in the end.
Perhaps, it will be on the day the sun rises again,” Derrick Berg
answered in an uncertain tone. “We were once ruled by the giants’
royal family, and we worshiped the Giant King Aurmir. Later, we
were saved by the Lord and we will never betray the Lord again.”
Ruled by the giants’ royal family… It really is ancient. But it doesn’t
seem to match…Alger, who had guessed at something, suddenly
recalled the description about the Second Epoch in the hidden
chapter of The Book of Storms.
The Second Epoch was also known as humanity’s Dark Epoch. At the
time, the sky, ocean, and land were ruled over by dragons, giants,
elves, mutants, devils, phoenixes, demonic wolves, and dead spirits.
But in the end, the Lord of Storms, Eternal Blazing Sun, and the God
of Knowledge and Wisdom led humanity into defeating the
supernatural creatures and ushered in the beginning of the Third
Epoch, the Glorious Era, which was later known as Cataclysm.
Giant King Aurmir… Klein repeated the name in silence.
In various legends and myths, it was a great existence on par with the
deities. Even now, there were still some places that worshiped him.
Even the most famous and most expensive grape wine in the Intis
Republic was named after Aurmir. It was said that the Giant King
particularly fancied grape wine which was like blood.
Considering the fact that the Church of the God of Combat is in
control of the complete pathway of the Warrior, which once belonged
to the giants, can I assume that Aurmir was the ancient God of
Combat? Klein guessed.
He nodded deliberately but didn’t think any further about it. He then
asked calmly, “Do you still oﬀer sacriﬁces to this omnipotent God?”
“Yes, we still do. But since the day we were abandoned, we have
never gotten any response.” Derrick’s voice had a hint of unconcealed
pain.
Klein leaned against the back of his chair leisurely. He half-closed his
eyes and said, “Describe the process of your oﬀering ritual in detail.”
Does Mr. Fool want to ﬁgure out the truth behind the City of Silver’s
abandonment? Or does He want to determine if the Creator still
exists? Alger suddenly felt a shock through his body and he quivered.
Not only was he afraid, but he was also excited too. This was because
he felt he was being made privy to the secrets between deities!
That made him feel like he had been elevated to a whole new level!
I’ve been chasing after power, after strength. Didn’t I do it to achieve
this kind of feeling? Alger leaned back, lifted his chin, and got carried
away with his thoughts.
Mr. Hanged Man’s mental state doesn’t seem to be normal… Audrey
looked at him with pity.
She ﬁnally understood that there might be some sort of shocking
secret behind the communication between Mr. Fool and The Sun,
which led to The Hanged Man’s loss of composure.
After the Qilangos commission is over, I’ll pay the price to get
information about what Mr. Hanged Man learned today… I wonder if
he would be willing to… Audrey thought in anticipation, yet was still
a little worried.
Derrick didn’t notice the weight that was hanging on his answer as he
replied frankly, “We build opulent altars covered in the Lord’s
symbol. Every time we receive a bumper Black-Faced Grass harvest,
we hold a sacriﬁcial ritual.
“We use the monsters we capture in the depths of the darkness to use
as sacriﬁcial oﬀerings. After we recite God’s honorable title and the
necessary prayers, we dance for Him and then kill the monsters, to let
their spirituality and tainted blood dye the entire altar. If we haven’t
caught any monsters, then we use a sinner on the lowest ﬂoor in the
City of Silver prison instead.
“Then, we turn the very ﬁrst batch of Black-Faced Grass into food
and serve it before the Lord.
“In the end, we sing praises in unison and end the ritual.”
Since I was planning to oﬀer a sacriﬁce to myself, I’m not picky about
time, and the altar can be as simple as possible. The most important
part would be to open a channel with the aid of the monsters’
spirituality or the blood containing Beyonder powers to complete the
sacriﬁce oﬀering. Of course, this is under the premise that one will
receive a response? How extravagant… Klein used his mysticism
knowledge to analyze every step of the sacriﬁcial ritual in the City of
Silver before ﬁnally saying, “What are the corresponding prayers?
What language do you recite them in?”
Derrick was also looking forward to this, so as to gain hints from Mr.
Fool on how to shake oﬀ the curse, so he recalled it carefully and
answered, “We use Jotun, which is also our common language.
“The corresponding prayers are,
“‘Your devoted believers pray for your attention.
“We pray for you to take their oﬀerings.
“We pray for you to open the gates to your Kingdom.'”
…
Klein listened in silence and intentionally let the engulﬁng fog slowly
swirl around him. He nodded as though deep in thought and
remained silent.
As for what he learned from it, he obviously wouldn’t share it…
Alger found it very normal. How could the secrets of a deity be
revealed directly to a mortal? Derrick also steeled his resolve to
quickly grow in power, so that he could obtain something that could
garner Mr. Fool’s interest in exchange for his guidance.
After some more communication, Klein ended the gathering. He
watched Justice’s, The Hanged Man’s, and The Sun’s ﬁgures vanish
before him.
He looked down and saw the boundless gray fog and crimson stars
that seemed eternally immutable.
However, after he advanced to Sequence 8, he realized that he could
connect even more stars. In other words, he could pull in more
members.
At least two… Klein nodded indiscernibly.
He wasn’t in a hurry to add new members. He planned to act as he
had before. He would ﬁrst wait and observe. If Justice and The
Hanged Man had any recommendations, he could assess them ﬁrst.
What I saw the last few times was when The Sun was praying. There
was a clear crystal ball before him, but ever since I pulled him into
the world above the gray fog, that crystal ball has never appeared
again… Does the prerequisite needed to pull people in through the
connection of the crimson star have something to do with having a
special item around them? Or does every crimson star correspond to
an item in reality, which, when it’s connected successfully, it would
return to the world above the gray fog?
I wonder if Miss Justice and Mr. Hanged Man were the same… Let’s
just assume that’s the case. In that case, if people without this special
item were to recite: “The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era, the
mysterious ruler above the gray fog; the King of Yellow and Black
who wields good luck.” and allow me to hear their prayers, would I
be able to pull them in?
I can give it a try in the future.
Klein didn’t stay any longer. He wrapped himself with spirituality
and stimulated a descent, leaving behind the lofty palace, the ancient
table, and the twenty-two high-back chairs which sat immutably
above the gray fog.
He had mastered the overﬂowing power of the Clown potion and
eliminated the corresponding negative eﬀects. Therefore, he wanted
to try the ritual to summon himself!
I wonder what I’ll conjure this time… Klein thought in anticipation
and fear as he fell through the mad ravings.
Chapter 181: Diﬀerent State
Klein didn’t hurry to dispel the wall of spirituality when he returned
to his room. Instead, he expertly took out a candle infused with
sandalwood and placed it in the middle of his desk.
He then followed the steps for the ritual, lighting up the candle with
his spirituality and scattering essences, extract, and herb powder
herbs symbolizing good luck and mystery. He saw the ﬂame alternate
between being dull and bright as he took in the fragrance of peace
and harmony.
Klein took two steps back and looked at the candle on the table. He
then shouted in the language of the giants, “I!”
After a pause, he switched to Hermes, “I summon in my name:
“The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era, the mysterious ruler above
the gray fog; the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.”
At that moment, the ﬂickering ﬂame fused itself with the harmonious
scent to form an illusory vortex, a vortex that manically absorbed the
spirituality.
After Klein ﬁnished reciting the incantations, the vortex stabilized to
become a palm-sized circle of grayish-white fog.
After observing the fog, Klein took four steps counterclockwise
without hesitation. He returned to the world above the fog, and as he
expected, he saw ripples of light spreading from his high-back chair,
accentuating the mysterious aura of the weird symbol—the Pupil-less
Eye and partially contorted lines—on his chair.
He took in a deep breath and calmed his soul down using Cogitation
before extending his hand toward the target.
At that moment, he heard the incantations that he had just recited.
He saw the surging spirituality and the rippling light fuse to form an
illusory door.
Compared to the previous time, the door was now completely formed
and was etched full of mysterious patterns!
The patterns were the same as the symbol on the back of The Fool’s
chair, a symbol made up of the Pupil-less Eye and the partially
contorted lines!
As he looked at the door, Klein focused his mind and willed the door
open.
Without warning, ripples formed in the eternally immutable grayish-
white fog and the majestic palace, like a stone being cast in a
peaceful pond. The ripple spread in the direction of the Door of
Summoning.
The sound of heavy scraping sound caused by friction could suddenly
be heard. A slit appeared in the heavy, mysterious door. Beyond it,
one could faintly see an immensely dark world, ﬁlled with countless
indescribable, transparent ﬁgures. There were also streaks of diﬀerent
colors, lustrous splendour that harbored inﬁnite knowledge.
At that moment, Klein felt an unimaginable, irresistible attractive
force coming from beyond the door. He couldn’t help but get pulled
towards it.
Damn! Are you not giving me the choice? Just as he had that alarming
thought, his body went through the slit and vanished into the
darkness behind the door.
The dizzying, maniacal roars gradually died down. Klein ﬁnally came
to his senses.
He saw a young man in front of him. The man was wearing an old
shirt, had black hair, brown eyes, and average-looking facial features.
The man had an average build, was a little skinny, but his frame
seemed to hide considerable power. He also had the obvious
demeanor of a scholar.
… Isn’t that me? Klein wasn’t a stranger to scenes like this. He
encountered something like this every time he looked in the mirror.
He nodded indiscernibly and surveyed his surroundings. He saw his
bed with a white bedsheet draped over it. He saw his half top hat,
tuxedo, and black windbreaker hanging on his clothes rack. He saw a
bookshelf with quite a number of books, his neat table that only had
one candle on it. He saw the candle ﬂame emitting a grayish-white
glow.
And now, he was ﬂoating in front of the palm-sized circle of grayish-
white fog.
So, have I really summoned myself? It feels a little like an out-of-body
experience… but there’s also something a little diﬀerent. Klein looked at
the physical body belonging to him, toward “his” blank, vacant eyes
and slipped into deep thought.
But he could ﬁnally conﬁrm one thing: it was only his soul, also
known as his Spirit Body in mysticism, that headed to the world of
fog. The exterior appearance was that of the Astral Projection.
It’s no wonder that I can directly see the Astral Projection surface of
Justice, The Hanged Man, and The Sun and conﬁrm whether they were
Beyonders or not when I was in the world above the fog. I could also guess
their Sequence numbers… My physical body seems to be under some form
of protection, perhaps from the power of the ritual, for me to stand with
such stability and not lose my balance. It should be the same for Miss
Justice and the others… Klein slowly got used to the current situation
and started to analyze the conditions of both his physical body and
soul.
He retracted his gaze and tried to move his soul, now fused with
powers from the mysterious space.
Whoosh!
A cold wind started to blow, as it spiraled around the room. Klein
savored the sensation of ﬂying, joyfully making circles in the room.
I can also take on the role of a “messenger” in this city now… I wonder if
I can carry physical items with me… He collected himself and stopped.
He ﬂoated in the air and experimented with his other abilities.
He tried to grab a notebook from his bookshelf, but his hand passed
through it.
It feels a little sticky, it’s not like moving through air… I might be able to
grab it after I become more powerful and able to better utilize the
mysterious powers of the world above the gray fog. Klein once again
tried grabbing a single piece of paper but to no avail.
After more than ten seconds of deliberation, he ﬂew toward the
clothes rack and extended his transparent hand into the pocket of his
black windbreaker. He touched the Slumber Charms and the Requiem
Charms that he replenished from a successful claim.
They were objects infused with his own spirituality, diﬀerent from
ordinary objects in supernatural terms. Thus, Klein wanted to see if
he could carry them about.
His palm once again went through the charms, but he could clearly
feel their existence. He felt the intertwining of spirituality, but he
didn’t have enough “strength” to pick them up. Of course, another
explanation was that there wasn’t enough spirituality within the
charms to achieve a strong resonance with his current state.
The spirituality isn’t strong enough… Klein thought as he moved
towards the other pocket. That pocket stored the Flaring Sun Charms
that he made with the stolen power of the divine blood and his own
spirituality.
A warm sensation quickly spread all over his body, making his form
turn more stable and his thoughts clearer.
He could take the thin gold piece out of his pocket. In the mirror in
his room, the charm seemed to ﬂoat out of the pocket on its own
accord, similar to the descriptions in ghost stories.
I can move Flaring Sun Charms. I can also create sound using my
spirituality… So I do have certain abilities in this state… Klein ﬂew
toward the mirror and stopped in front of it. He saw that only the
thin gold piece was reﬂected. Other than that, it was only the
furniture and darkness in the room caused by the drawn curtains.
After a few seconds of consideration, he placed the Flaring Sun
Charm onto the bed before returning to the front of the mirror. He
wanted to see if he could move through the mirror.
His vision turned dark. Klein’s vantage point suddenly changed. He
saw the room that was reﬂected in the mirror, the furniture that was
accentuated by the weak sources of light. It made him feel as though
he was hiding in an obscure corner, peeping into a tiny portion of the
room.
I really can go through the mirror. But this is only an ordinary item which
doesn’t lead to some mysterious and strange world… Klein nodded and
charged forward, once again returning to his room.
The success of carrying the Flaring Sun Charm gave him immense
conﬁdence. Hence, he attempted grabbing something else.
Mr. Azik’s copper whistle!
The moment he touched the ancient and intricate object, he felt his
spirituality expanding and freezing.
His illusory eyes turned into dark, burning ﬂames.
It feels like I have gotten a little more powerful. My form is like a wraith’s
but without the strong sense of vengeance… Klein projected his current
appearance by calming his mind.
This was one of the abilities of a Clown.
“Mr. Azik’s copper whistle is truly fascinating.” He nodded, noticing
that he could now pick up pieces of paper with certain weights. He
could also pick up his Slumber Charms.
How unfortunate. I can carry the silver ritual dagger, but the revolver is
too heavy…Klein concluded his experiments and turned to see if he
could use any spells in this state.
After serious tests, he concluded that he could conjure two spells, the
ﬁrst being a formless howl could shake the souls of his target and the
second was inducing a state akin to freezing via contact with a target.
Klein came to a satisﬁed stop. He looked out the oriel window,
towards the sunlight, and street covered by the curtain.
I wonder if I can move about during the day in this state… He muttered
as he ﬂoated towards the window.
He then carefully lifted the curtain, creating a slit and allowing a
small amount of sunlight to pass through the wall of spirituality and
into the room.
Under the radiant sunlight, Klein felt his soul boil with a black fog.
His powers were also being drained away, bit by bit.
He quickly released his grip, allowing the curtain to block the light.
I can’t… Klein thought for a moment, then placed his gaze on the
Flaring Sun Charm on the bed.
I wonder if the eﬀect would be the same if I’m augmented with the divine
blood of the Eternal Blazing Sun? He ﬂoated toward the bed and tried
to grab the thin piece of gold.
But just as he touched the charm, the warm pure feeling formed a
stark contrast with his burgeoning cold spirituality. It was like an
existential conﬂict between ﬁre and water.
Sizzle!
He tossed the piece of gold away as if he had been burned.
The power of Mr. Azik’s copper whistle cannot inhabit my soul at the
same time as the Flaring Sun Charm. Klein understood as he set the
copper whistle down. He felt his spirituality shrink, and the black
ﬂames in his eyes extinguished.
In this state, both the spells I can use have been weakened… After
another round of experimentation, Klein grabbed the Flaring Sun
Charm, once again feeling the stabilizing and warm purifying eﬀects
the charm had on his Spirit Body.
He returned to the window and cautiously moved through the
curtain.
The sunlight only felt warm on his body, but it didn’t inﬂict any
harm.
Not bad… Klein let out a mixed smile. He made his way past the wall
of spirituality and cautiously ﬂew out of the house with the intention
of conducting more experiments.
Chapter 182: Wanderer Klein
The weather in Tingen turned from refreshing cool to a bitingly chill
in early September. However, the sunlight at three or four in the
afternoon was still warm and soothing.
Klein went through the wall of spirituality and the oriel window. He
ﬂoated in the air outside of his bedroom as he overlooked the people
and carriages shuttling to and fro Daﬀodil Street.
Just then, there was a man in a gray labor uniform who suddenly
lifted his head and looked over.
Klein panicked and wanted to hide, but he couldn’t ﬁnd any suitable
cover.
When he didn’t see anything to hide behind, he started to sneak back
into his house. However, from the corner of his eye, he saw the man
earlier merely glanced over the window. Then, his gaze followed a
ﬂying sparrow, but unfortunately, he lost sight of it.
In Tingen, birds could occasionally be seen.
Phew… I forgot that an ordinary person wouldn’t be able to see me…
Klein let out a breath of relief and felt that he had yet to get used to
the situation.
As he grew more conﬁdent, he ﬂew lower and went to a nearby
spacious street where he ﬂoated above people’s heads.
As he drew closer, Klein immediately realized that his “vision” was
the same as his Spirit Vision. There was no need for him to activate
it, but there was a restriction to its range.
Also, besides the aura and emotional colors, he could faintly feel the
existence of everyone’s soul. They were blurry, illusory, and
transparent.
In this state, I think I could bypass a person’s body and directly attack
their soul…Klein nodded thoughtfully.
He circled around and prepared to test his fastest speed. Hence, he
ﬂew towards Iron Cross Street with all his strength.
It didn’t take long before he came to a halt and arrived outside the
apartment he used to stay in.
It should be about the speed of a car on the highway… It’s a pity that I
still can’t go in and out of the spirit world; otherwise, it’d be perfect… But
if I were to be lost in the spirit world, it’s said that the consequences are
very severe. Just as Klein ﬁnished his self-evaluation, he felt low-
spirited and gloomy. There was an unspoken pressure.
He looked around and felt that Iron Cross Street was engulfed with
gloominess that ordinary people could see, a darkness that the
sunlight couldn’t dispel. There were layers of numbness, despair,
pain, and other emotions overlapping, as though they were corporeal.
It feels just like what I experienced when using spiritual perception
on this street when I ﬁrst became a Seer. Iron Cross Street’s Middle
Street and Lower Street hasn’t changed to this day… I wonder how
many years it took to accumulate such oppression and gloominess…
Klein recalled the past and sighed as he ﬂew up to the third ﬂoor of
the surrounding buildings.
He ﬁnally felt sunlight and shook oﬀ his depression.
Klein ﬂew along Lower Street and, from time to time, he would see
residents who were dressed in tattered clothes, looking expressionless
and malnourished. He even ran into two bodies that had died of
natural causes—prolonged starvation and malnutrition with a sudden
inﬂiction of an illness.
There were countless people who died in agony every month.
However, the bankrupt farmers and slaves that surged in from the
Southern Continent replaced them very quickly… Klein sighed in
silence and changed direction and ﬂew south.
That was the industrial area of Tingen. The steelworks, lead factories,
ceramic factories, printing factories, metalworks factories, machine
construction factories, and other factories all built right next to one
another.
As he ﬂew, Klein saw towering chimneys. He saw dust ﬁlling the air
and a thick gloominess that was only slightly better than the that of
Lower Street.
It was crowded with emotions of exhaustion, pain, pessimism, and
numbness. Laborers who were in their thirties were considered the
minority.
Just as Klein wanted to ﬂy lower to look at the area more closely, he
suddenly felt weak. It was a weakness that came from inside him.
My spirituality can’t withstand the duress… Klein became alarmed. He
was in a hurry to return home, but he suddenly thought of a better
possibility.
I was “summoned” out. If I were to end the summon, I would return
naturally! He calmed down and carefully felt the surrounding
environment and his status. Unsurprisingly, he discovered something
that was connected to him from inﬁnitely far away but also inﬁnitely
close to him. It formed an intricate tether to him.
Through this connection, Klein clenched the Flaring Sun Charm
tightly and willed the strong desire to end the “summoning.”
A massive and terrifying suction force overwhelmed him as his ﬁgure
went from transparent to nearly invisible, and in a ﬂash, he vanished
from the corporeal world.
…
Silence was everywhere in the boundless gray fog, and there were
illusory crimson stars that twinkled. Klein reappeared in the lofty
palace that looked like the home of a giant, as he sat in the seat of
honor at the ancient bronze table.
The entire procedure went well… Furthermore… Klein looked at his
Spirit Body in pleasant surprise and saw that it contained a warm and
pure gold portion.
The Flaring Sun Charm!
I actually brought something corporeal into the world above the gray fog!
He held the charm with a smile and ﬁddled with it to make sure it
wasn’t an illusory item.
Klein stood up and paced back and forth, feeling completely gratiﬁed.
He thought to himself in anticipation.
As expected, ingredients and items can be brought into this mysterious
space!
I just need to ﬁnd the correct way!
However, this method is quite complicated. It needs me to do quite a bit
before it reaches the destination. Furthermore, if I were to be summoned
by the members all the time, it would damage The Fool’s image. I can only
do that occasionally, or after I understand it more. I can design an
incantation that summons The Fool’s “adorer,” but it will similarly be
directed at me…
… I’m not some born laborer. Why must the incantation point towards
me? When the time comes, I can conjure what seems like a messenger or a
more unique “adorer” and let it deal with the dispatch and collection of
materials…
Ideas popped up one after another as Klein contemplated. But due to
the limitation of his capabilities and knowledge, he couldn’t put them
into practice just yet.
As he became even weaker, Klein didn’t dare to stay any longer. He
used his spirituality to envelop himself and simulate the feeling of
descending.
In the blink of an eye, he returned to his bedroom. He saw splendid
sunlight pouring in through the gap in his curtains.
He examined his body and made sure that the Flaring Sun Charm
wasn’t brought back but left above the gray fog.
When I’ve gotten enough rest, I’ll repeat the summoning ritual at dawn to
bring the Flaring Sun Charm back to reality… Sigh, it would be great if I
could maintain the state a little longer. That way, I would be able to
investigate the houses with red chimneys. It’s such a pity that I can’t do it
yet. I could only ﬂy long enough to investigate a few houses before having
to return above the gray fog and rest for half a day. The eﬃciency would
be just as low. Klein walked before his desk and put out the silent
burning candle.
After he packed his things, he didn’t remove the wall of spirituality
immediately. Instead, he sat down and took out a pen and paper to
write a letter—a letter to Mr. Azik!
After he wrote the salutation of “Dear Sir,” he pondered for a few
minutes before penning:
“… I recently received news that one of the Seven Pirate Admirals,
Rear Admiral Hurricane, Qilangos, has inﬁltrated Backlund. He
carries a mystical item called the ‘Creeping Hunger.’ It provides an
ability similar to a Shepherd, which is a Sequence 5 Beyonder that
swallows diﬀerent souls and obtains their corresponding powers. It’s
said that there is a limit to the number of souls that one can let out to
graze, but the souls can be swapped out…
“… Qilangos seems to have many Beyonder powers, and I’m not sure
what he’s trying to do in Backlund… The news I received suggested
that he might be after a very important, very mystical item that could
make Qilangos a High-Sequence Beyonder or as powerful as a High-
Sequence Beyonder…”
Klein fabricated his source of information to generally describe the
situation with Qilangos, but it wasn’t like Mr. Azik would look for a
Nighthawk Captain to conﬁrm it.
Klein didn’t directly request assistance but made it seem like he
brought up the subject casually to encourage Azik to be careful.
Regardless of whether Mr. Azik was willing to help, it wouldn’t hurt
to ﬁrst lay the foundations! If Klein eventually needed to ask for help,
it wouldn’t appear out of the blue that way! Klein let out a breath
slowly and started writing the main content of the letter.
“The mastermind behind all that has happened hasn’t taken any
further action, and I still haven’t found any related clues.
“The reason why I’m contacting you so suddenly is mainly to ask for
your guidance regarding sacriﬁcial rituals. I came across something
like that during a recent mission…”
With The Sun’s description and Mr. Azik’s answer to compare, I should be
able to try a sacriﬁcial ritual after that. By reversing the ritual, I should be
able to bestow items… This would be a more suitable ritual for
exchanging ingredients and items rather than summoning myself… Yes,
let’s hope that Mr. Azik remembers the knowledge about this… Klein
nodded slightly. He put down his pen without signing his name.
There’s only one copper whistle, so I’m sure Mr. Azik wouldn’t make a
mistake with the sender.
Therefore, to be careful, Klein didn’t leave his name.
After he folded the letter, he looked at his three-meter-tall ceiling. He
picked up the copper whistle from the bed a little hesitantly.
Perfect, let it squat and get the letter! Klein emphasized inwardly before
lifting his right hand and putting the copper whistle to his lips. He
puﬀed up his cheeks and blew hard.
The whistle didn’t produce a sound, but Klein’s acute senses noticed
that the surroundings had instantly turned cold.
He activated his Spirit Vision and saw that there were blurry yet
glistening white bones surging out of his study desk like a fountain as
it rose in height.
The white bones quickly gathered together and turned into an
illusory yet huge monster. Its head tore through the wall of
spirituality and reached somewhere unknown.
Klein looked at the white skeleton’s thighs and body, as well as its
arm that hung down. Seeing its right palm open up, the corner of
Klein’s lips twitched as he tossed over the folded letter.
The large bony palm did a sweep and caught the letter ﬁrmly.
Then, Klein picked up his copper whistle and blew again without
hesitation.
The monster crumbled in an instant, transforming into bones that fell
onto his desk before sinking in and vanishing.
After doing all of that, Klein removed the wall of spirituality. In the
sudden wind that stirred, he hobbled towards the clothes rack and
returned the copper whistle to its original place.
Then, he quickly walked to his bed and planted his head into it.
The moment his body touched the soft mattress, he fell into a deep
sleep.
Chapter 183: A Lesson on
Mediumship
After dinner, Klein engaged in small talk before reclining on the sofa.
He picked up the recently delivered Awwa Evening News and started
leisurely reading.
Benson wore a bitter expression as he sat opposite his sister. In front
of him was the dining table which had been wiped clean by Bella. On
it was grammar books, classic literature, accountancy notes, and
other materials. In front of Melissa were her notes and stationery,
including but not limited to pens, paper, rulers, compasses, etc.
“It’s like I’ve been taken some ten years back. Back then, I was still a
student at the Church’s Sunday school,” Benson complained, but he
continued to study with his head down.
That’s not too bad. This scene makes me feel the achievement of being a
parent…Klein smiled and said, “Knowledge can change one’s destiny,
and diligence will result in glory.”
I made up the latter half of that saying. I wonder if Roselle has said that
before… He lampooned in his heart.
The room quickly became quiet except for the sound of pens
scratching across pages or of books being ﬂipped. Bella had ﬁnished
doing the dishes and tidied up the kitchen before returning to her
room on the ﬁrst ﬂoor—a small room that was formerly the guest
room.
Klein sipped on his Sibe black tea as he read the newspaper,
occasionally engaging in small talk with his siblings. It was relaxing.
Suddenly, the gas lamps in the living room and dining room turned
dark at the same time as if they had run out of fuel.
Benson and Melissa looked up towards the lamps, in an attempt to
ﬁgure out the cause.
Klein also looked towards the lamps.
At this moment, he felt something touch his arm.
He was the only living person in the living room, but something had
touched his arm!
His hair stood on end. Klein retracted his arm and turned to look
over. He saw ﬁve thin, pale ﬁngers growing on the tip of a tongue.
Underneath them was an irregular row of sharp teeth!
Klein instinctively reached for his pockets. Within them were the
Requiem Charms and Slumber Charms. But he caught a glimpse of a
neatly folded piece of paper in the ﬁngers’ grasp.
A letter…
A messenger!
Klein heaved a sigh of relief.
At that moment, the ﬁve pale ﬁngers prodded his arm again.
Klein saw Melissa about to stand up and check on the gas lamp. He
reached out with his left hand and grabbed the letter, then he quickly
retracted his arm and hid the letter under the stack of newspapers on
the table.
He then saw the ﬁngers, tongue, and the irregular row of sharp teeth
fade away and disappear from the corner of his eyes.
With a thought, Klein tapped his left molar and silently activated his
Spirit Vision.
He once again saw the ﬁve abnormally thin ﬁngers. He saw the long
red tongue adorned with sharp, white teeth. He saw them retracting
back into the transparent face on the ground.
A second later, the face disappeared completely. The lights in the
living room and dining room were restored back to normal.
“Strange…” Melissa pouted, ﬁnding no faults with the lamps even
after a serious check.
Why is the lady in our house responsible for such things, while the men
watch from the side? Klein shook his head and deactivated his Spirit
Vision.
When spirits were willing to be seen and had the corresponding
abilities, even an ordinary person could spot them. What happened
just now was an example.
After discussing the problem with the gas lamps, the Moretti siblings
became quiet once again. Benson and Melissa once again delved into
the ocean of knowledge.
Klein used the newspaper as a cover and unfolded the letter with one
hand. He placed the paper between the newspapers and started
reading the reply from Spirit Guide Daly, “… I have to emphasize
again, I prefer the title of Spirit Medium.
“I’m going to give you an positive response regarding what you
asked. Yes, mediumship rituals can also be used on living beings, not
just living humans.
“But this is troublesome and poses some level of danger. The souls
left behind by the dead are pure. They have few impurities or chaotic
thoughts. We can communicate with them, asking them questions
and receiving answers without any barriers. Of course, you can use
the method of dream divination to directly receive images from them.
“But that cannot be replicated with living humans. The subject still
has a will and would ﬁght against unprotected communication
between souls.”
Klein’s lips twitched when he read the letter. He conﬁrmed that it
was Daly herself who wrote this letter.
Unprotected communication… That really is the way she speaks…
Klein returned to the letter after taking a quick glance at his siblings.
“We only have two methods when faced with such a situation. First,
we can use our powerful spirituality and sophisticated mediumship
rituals to triumph over the will of the other person, engaging in a
barbaric method of communication. Second, we can use medication
to make the other party relax. What I use the most are the Amantha
essence and Eye of the Spirit medication. Heh heh, I’m sure that you
still have a lingering impression of those.
“After reaching the stage of channeling the soul, you must take note
that you’re also in a spiritual state, unlike when you’re
communicating with the souls left behind by the dead. In simpler
terms, your spirituality is entering the spirituality world of the other
party.
“Take note, a professional Spirit Medium wouldn’t lack the means of
protecting themselves under such a state. But you cannot do that.
You would not be able to learn or use the techniques that I know of
even if I explained them to you.
“So you have to maintain a certain level of lucidity and rational
thought. Only through this method can you ﬁght back against the
torrents of the other party’s random and chaotic thoughts before
arriving before his spirit and establishing communication. At this
point, you’ll be communicating at the level of the Body of Heart and
Mind.
“At this stage, you have two options. One is to use a technique to
forcefully read the memories of the other party, but you have to be
very careful, for you cannot be sure if the things you’re reading are
the things that you want to know. If you indiscriminately receive a
large amount of memories from a person, it’s very likely that your
soul would collapse. Furthermore, it will cause severe damage to
your target’s soul, sometimes even destroying them completely.
Unless you’re a professional Spirit Medium, I do not suggest using
this method.
“The second option is to gently communicate with the other party’s
Body of Heart and Mind. No matter how you entered, whether it be
through violence or medication, the target will deﬁnitely be in a
groggy state. They would generally not be able to lie, just like you
couldn’t… no, you cannot recall what happened to you! Although I
know you’ve deﬁnitely forgotten about it!”
Sorry, Madam Daly, I was very awake back then… Klein chortled
inwardly as he lowered his gaze and read the rest of the letter.
“Such communication can allow you to obtain real answers, but they
won’t necessarily all be the truth. You should understand what I
mean. As long as you read the news, you must have heard Emperor
Roselle’s famous quote. I don’t remember the actual quote, but the
essence of the quote is that what one says shall be the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth. In short, a spirit might not
remember everything because a lot of memories are in one’s
subconscious or collectively be in the subconscious. Oh, I shouldn’t
mention that. Dunn calls it the evil theories of the Psychology
Alchemists.
“Thus, you must be able to guide the soul and be good at designing
your questions, do you understand? The corresponding techniques
include…
“These are all under normal circumstances. What should we pay
attention to when we’re trying to communicate with the soul of a
Beyonder who has gone insane?
“It’s the same—maintaining your lucidity. You must not fall into a
daze at all. This is because a Beyonder’s spirituality is very potent
and their spirit is ﬁlled with chaotic thoughts. Let me give an
example. An ordinary person’s consciousness is an island. The
subconscious is the portion of the sea beneath the island. The
collective subconscious is the surrounding sea. The sky belongs to the
spirit world. As for a Beyonder, his ‘island’ might have a controllable
active volcano. A lunatic’s island might have a volcano that can erupt
at any time. It would quake the foundations and pollute the ‘sea.’
“When you come into unprotected contact with the spirit of an insane
person, his chaotic thoughts might infect you, just like how polluted
water in the sea would ﬂow outward, spreading further.
“Yes, channeling his spirit under such conditions is like linking your
‘sea’ to his; thus, you need to pay close attention to this pollution.
“A few examples are when a Spirit Medium is careless when doing
similar things and didn’t use any protection. After that, they can
develop mental problems similar to that of the target.
“Under normal circumstances, mental diseases are not contagious.
But in the domain of mysticism, in the world of channeling spirits,
they can indeed be contagious.
“Maintaining your lucidity and not being aﬀected by the chaotic
thoughts of the target are things that you must pay attention to.
Following those would be the guided questions, which can be used to
eﬀectively communicate with an insane person.
“If you wish to try this, I suggest applying a Sedative Agent before
doing so. The corresponding formula is available behind Tingen City’s
Chanis Gate. There’s also the formulated product. It can be eﬀective
in helping you maintain rational thought during the process.
“Of course, you can also get Dunn to apply for help from the
Backlund diocese. I’m very willing to see the spirituality state of an
insane Sequence 7 Psychiatrist.”
Lucidity and rational thought… That’s my expertise. I maintained lucidity
and rational thought even when my soul was being channeled… Of
course, I’m not someone who lets conﬁdence get to my head. I’ll still apply
for the Sedative Agent, Amantha extract, and Eye of the Spirit
medication! Klein heaved a sigh of relief, a little eager to make the
attempt.
He put down his newspaper and stood up. He then entered the
bathroom and ignited the letter with his spirituality before tossing
the ashes into the toilet bowl and ﬂushing them.
That night, Klein once again tried the ritual for summoning himself
and brought the Flaring Sun Charm back to the physical world and
into his room.
He also didn’t receive Mr. Azik’s letter even though he had expected
a swift reply.
Perhaps he needed some time to recall the knowledge… or perhaps, he’s
not free to give a reply for now… Or perhaps he’s worried that he would
interrupt my sleep.Klein dispelled the wall of spirituality as he
speculated. He made his way to the bed.
…
The following day, Tuesday morning.
Klein entered the Blackthorn Security Company and knocked on the
door to the Captain’s oﬃce as usual.
Chapter 184: Behind the Gate
“Please come in,” Dunn Smith said with a mellow and pleasant voice.
Klein turned the doorknob and pushed open the door to see the
Captain having his breakfast. In his right hand was a cup of coﬀee
emitting a rich aroma. On the plate in front of him, there was white
bread toast and bacon.
Dunn placed the remaining sandwiched toast with butter into his
mouth and ate it. He then silently pointed to the chair opposite his
desk.
Klein didn’t disturb his Captain from enjoying his breakfast. With a
smile, he sat down as he waited patiently.
Dunn saw that he was in no hurry, so he relaxed back into his chair,
picked up his coﬀee to take a sip, and swallowed the food in his
mouth.
He took a napkin, wiped the corners of his lips and said, “What’s the
matter?”
Klein nodded seriously and said, “I’ve met Daxter Guderian, the
doctor at the asylum and also member of the Psychology Alchemists.”
As he spoke, he caught a glimpse of the magazine that was spread
open before the Captain.
“Did he provide any news?” Dunn asked, crossing his arms.
Klein simply described, “He told me that before Hood Eugen went
crazy, there was someone who visited him quite frequently. That
person’s name is Lanevus.”
“Lanevus…” Dunn massaged his temples. “I seem to have heard of it
before…”
“He’s the cheat who swindled at least ten thousand pounds,” Klein
reminded him.
Dunn thought for a while with a serious look on his face. He then
shook his head to show that he had no memory of it.
Captain, you’re not sensitive at all when it comes to money! Klein
lampooned and told him the related story about Lanevus by
highlighting the main points.
“The cheat falsely claimed that he had prospected and purchased an
iron mine with rich deposits of iron ore. He raised funds from private
individuals in Tingen and swindled more than ten thousand pounds.
Someone I know from the Divination Club suﬀered a loss from this.
In addition, a young woman was swindled into an engagement with
him and is now pregnant with his child.”
“He visited Hood Eugen multiple times before he went crazy,” Dunn
said in thought. “Sequence 8 Beyonder, Swindler? The Marauder
pathway…”
Captain, your memory is actually good when it comes to this kind of
thing… Klein found it funny as he reﬂected over it. He nodded faintly
and said, “That was my guess as well.
“Because the steelworks company that Lanevus set up was in the
South and the victims were of several diﬀerent beliefs, the case
wasn’t passed to us in the end. Even if there had been evidence of
Beyonder involvement in the case, it would’ve been passed over to
the Mandated Punishers.”
Dunn ﬁnally understood the ins and outs of the story. He looked at
Klein with his deep gray eyes and said, “What do you want to do?”
Cough, Captain, can you please not be so sensitive… Klein replied with a
mask of solemnity, “I want to talk to Hood Eugen via a mediumship
ritual and ﬁgure out why Lanevus came looking for him. I want to
know if that visit is directly related to him going insane.”
Dunn nodded slightly and said, “Even if you hadn’t applied to do it, I
would’ve had a similar experiment done when we were certain that
Hood Eugen is crazy.
“However, Daly told me that it’s quite risky. Are you conﬁdent? I can
ask for assistance from the Backlund diocese. It shouldn’t be a
problem to delay it for a few days.”
Klein’s main motivation to become a Beyonder was to study
mysticism and ﬁnd a way home. As it was a chance for practical
exercise and he was conﬁdent enough, he was naturally unwilling to
give it up.
“Captain, I’ve mastered knowledge on the subject. I’m conﬁdent
about this.
“Of course, I’ll require certain ingredients, such as the Amantha
extract, Eye of the Spirit medicine, and Sedative Agent.”
“Sedative Agent…” Dunn ruminated over the name and conﬁrmed
Klein’s professionalism.
He remembered Daly mention that it was a liquid medicine that was
rarely used yet was very eﬃcient in mediumship.
Dunn Smith pondered for nearly twenty seconds and leaned back into
his chair. He said, “Go ahead and ﬁll out a request form. Then,
collect what you need from behind Chanis Gate. Eh… I’m not sure if
there are any ﬁnished goods. If there aren’t any, pick up the
ingredients you need and concoct the medicine accordingly.”
“Alright,” Klein replied happily.
He didn’t get up but sat ﬁrmly in his chair.
Dunn massaged his temples. He thought carefully and said, “It
happens to be my turn to monitor the asylum this evening… We can’t
visit Hood Eugen directly. No one knows if there are members of the
Psychology Alchemists disguised as doctors, nurses, janitors, or
patients in the asylum. No one knows if the Psychology Alchemists
are monitoring Hood Organ either. Any action we take must be
secret. We can’t expose that Daxter Guderian has become our
informant.”
“… We’ll go at dawn by sneaking in secretly.”
“Yes, I’ll keep guard while you perform the ritual to prevent any
accidents from happening.”
That’d be best! If Hood Eugen is just pretending to be crazy, while I use a
mediumship ritual on him, It would be like I barged into the zoo and
danced before a tiger… Klein relaxed and said sincerely, “Yes,
Captain!”
He stood up and walked towards the door.
Just then, the corner of his eyes noticed the title of the magazine
article the Captain was reading: “Donningsman Tree Sap in the
Southern Continent’s rainforests has had a signiﬁcant eﬀect on
boosting hair growth.”
… Klein retracted his gaze, opened the door, and exited the Captain’s
oﬃce.
Suddenly, there was a playful thought that ﬂashed through his mind.
Actually, a Beyonder doesn’t need to go through such trouble. If Old Neil
was still around, he could design a ritualistic magic for hair regrowth.
Then, he would pray for the Goddess’s assistance. Whether one would be
covered with hair and become a curly haired baboon, that’s another
story… What would the Goddess’s response be? If it were me, I would
deﬁnitely curse: Motherf*cker…
That thought suddenly tainted Klein’s happiness with sadness, but
there was also a hint of hilarity in the sadness.
He entered the clerk’s oﬃce and sat before the Akerson Model 1346
typewriter and ﬁnished typing his application.
After Dunn Smith stamped and signed the application, he took it
down to the basement and walked along the tunnel that was lit up
with gas lamps, towards Chanis Gate.
Only at that moment did Klein realize something.
It would be the ﬁrst time that he was going beyond the mysterious
gate!
“I wonder what it looks like…” He quickened his pace with
anticipation and came before the twin doors of the black gate.
He ﬁrst passed his request to Seeka Tron, who was on duty that day
for registration purposes. Then, Klein took back the document that
now had her signature as well. He knocked on Chanis Gate and
sensed how empty and distant the echo was.
He didn’t hear any footsteps but within half a minute, the gate with
seven Dark Sacred Emblems opened with a creak.
Chanis Gate opened up to allow a single person’s passage before
coming to a stop. Klein then walked in with the help of the gas lamps
on both sides of the corridor.
Behind the gate, there was an elderly man with obvious wrinkles and
thinning hair. He was wearing a classic black robe and holding a barn
lantern.
The dim candlelight shone through the glass, illuminating the elderly
man’s expressionless face which was a mixture of light and darkness.
His light blue eyes were like ice that had been frozen for a thousand
years.
“Document,” he said with his husky voice.
Klein had seen the elderly man before because at dusk every day, he
would come out from behind Chanis Gate with his partners. They
would pass by the duty room and take the hallway leading to Saint
Selena Cathedral.
They were Nighthawks who had aged and volunteered to keep guard
inside.
According to Klein’s understanding, there were ﬁve of them who
were keeping watch.
“This is my application.” He passed the document in his hands to the
elderly man before him.
The guard with light blue eyes raised the barn lantern and looked
through the request carefully. After he made sure that there were no
mistakes, he moved aside and let Klein pass.
Klein passed through Chanis Gate slowly. He had yet to take a good
look around when he felt an indescribably chill.
It wasn’t the cold of winter, but a chill that would make a human’s
spirituality shiver.
Klein lifted his gaze and looked afar. He saw candlesticks appearing
on the wall in succession, and there were silver candles with carvings
on them. The ﬂames gave out a blue luster, without any ﬂickering.
Creak!
The guard closed Chanis Gate, and the surroundings became
extremely quiet.
There was a broad walkway before Klein, a walkway paved with
ancient stone slabs.
On both sides of the walkway were stone doors labeled “Ingredients,”
“Medicine,” “Information,” and so on.
At the end of the walkway, there was a ﬂight of stairs that connected
to the lower ﬂoors. It extended into the dark as though it was
connected to the abyss.
It should be connected to diﬀerent sealed locations that have Sealed
Artifacts. I heard that there are a few ﬂoors… I wonder which ﬂoor
contains Saint Selena’s ashes?Klein adapted to the brightness behind
the gate and suddenly felt that there was something shapeless
scraping against his skin. They were in strips, and every one of them
chilled him to the bones.
He shivered, and he couldn’t help but activate his Spirit Vision.
Then, he looked at the entire area behind Chanis Gate. It was ﬁlled
with ﬁne black lines. They were swaying lightly, occasionally
clustered together, occasionally extended. They were tightly knitted
without any gaps.
This… This is the sealing power behind Chanis Gate? Klein nodded
indiscernibly. He reined in his thoughts and followed the guard. They
went through a heavy stone door labeled “Medicine Room.”
Very soon, he found the Amantha extract, the Eye of the Spirit
medicine, and the Sedative Agent by following the alphabet labels.
He had seen the ﬁrst two before, but it was his ﬁrst time picking up
the latter one. He saw that a blue ﬂuid rippled in the translucent
glass bottle. For some reason, looking at the ﬂuid made him feel as
though he had entered a mother’s embrace.
On the bottle, there was a label. It showed the manufacturing date
and the expiration date, which was still some time away.
Luckily, it can still be used… Klein took the three tiny bottles of
medicine and walked back to Chanis Gate with the guard keeping
him company. He shook oﬀ the feeling of coldness that reached the
deepest corner of his soul and the creepy experience of being swept
by the black lines.
When Chanis Gate closed, he couldn’t help but look back. He
mumbled to himself, “Staying in there for a long time would aﬀect
both the body and soul, right?
“It’s no wonder the guards have to volunteer…”
…
Around dawn, Klein used a special technique to lock his bedroom. He
pushed open his oriel window and jumped down.
The two-story height posed no danger to the present him. He landed
steadily without faltering at all.
The Nighthawks’ carriage was already parked opposite, waiting for
him.
Without any exchange, Klein quickly arrived at Tingen Asylum in the
North Borough. Following the Captain’s instructions, he took a detour
to one of the corners without a street lamp where he saw the waiting
Dunn Smith.
“Let’s go in.” Dunn nodded faintly. “I’ve made sure that there’s no
one around.”
“Alright.” Klein quickly got closer.
As a Clown, entering an asylum… it keeps reminding me of a famous
saying: “It’s like returning home 1 ” He mused to himself.
He followed Dunn closely. With the aid of the wall’s bumpy surface,
they somersaulted into the asylum quickly and agilely with
outstanding balance.
Dunn turned around and looked. He nodded slightly to give his
approval.
The two of them crouched and silently moved through the hospital’s
small park and activity square. They then entered the three-story
building in the asylum and arrived at the top ﬂoor where Hood
Eugen’s room was.
As Hood Eugen had the possibility of becoming violent now that he
had gone insane, he had been assigned to a single room. Luckily, the
monitoring Nighthawks hadn’t wasted their eﬀorts during the
surveillance and had made a copy of the room key long ago.
Kacha!
The lock clicked lightly, and Dunn entered ﬁrst. Klein projected his
gaze past his ﬁgure and saw the person sitting on the bed.
Hood Eugen’s face was long and skinny. His eye sockets were deeply
concave and his blond hair was disheveled.
He was looking at the metal barred window with his grayish-blue
eyes. He was looking at the crimson moon outside.
Klein closed the door to the room and chuckled as he casually asked,
“Why aren’t you sleeping?”
Dunn was taken aback and suddenly remembered that Klein was now
a Sequence 8 Clown. Hence, he remained silent and backed oﬀ to a
corner of the room.
Hood Eugen turned his head and looked at Klein. He chuckled
foolishly and replied, “I’m waiting for my cake.”
Chapter 185: Spiritual World
Waiting for cake? That really wasn’t an answer that I was expecting… Of
course, if I was able to anticipate the answer of a mental patient, wouldn’t
that mean that I was almost there myself… The thought ﬂashed through
Klein’s mind. He maintained his relaxed smile as if he was chatting
with a friend.
“Who’s going to send you a cake?”
Hood Eugen’s expression fell instantly, his face long and depressed.
“No, there’s no cake… There’s no cake!
“You stole my cake!”
His voice suddenly became shrill as he glared angrily at Klein.
Without waiting for Klein to speak, he let out a shout and opened his
mouth, revealing two rows of white teeth.
Following which, he leaped from his mattress while salivating. He
closed in on Klein with one step and extended his hands, attempting
to grab onto Klein’s shoulders. He wanted to drag Klein towards him
and bite him.
Despite the sudden attack, Klein reacted quickly despite appearing a
little ﬂustered. He instantly bent his knee and squatted. At the same
time, he tilted his body to the side and raised his left arm.
Oof!
His shoulder slammed into Hood Eugen’s abdomen, causing Hood’s
eyes to turn white and drool to drip from his mouth.
But Hood Eugen didn’t stop moving. He allowed the momentum to
carry him down as he opened his arms in an attempt to pull Klein
into a bear hug.
Klein tilted his body to the side and rolled over, his movements were
smooth as though he had practiced them hundreds of times.
He pushed against the ground with his right hand and stood up with
a somersault. He decided to go on the oﬀensive and charged forward
to restrain his opponent.
But at that moment, Hood Eugen only stood there blankly, his eyes
losing focus, becoming vacant and lost.
Klein froze for a moment. He turned his head towards the corner of
the room, only to see Dunn Smith, wearing a black windbreaker and
matching hat, with his hands clasped tightly together and looking
down.
The Captain has dragged Hood Eugen into a dream… Upon realizing
this, he stopped his subsequent attack and took the opportunity to
take out the silver ritual dagger that couldn’t harm anyone. He used
it to create a wall of spirituality which sealed the ward.
Klein then took out three candles infused with mint and placed them
on the window in a triangular formation. One candle signiﬁed the
Evernight Goddess, another the Mother of the Secrets, and the last
represented himself.
Soon after, he set up a simple altar and used his spirituality to ignite
the candles.
Just as he was about to warn the Captain, Dunn raised his head and
smiled.
“Hood Eugen’s dreams are a sea of chaos. There’s no way to guide it.”
Just as he ﬁnished his sentence, a luster returned to Hood Eugen’s
eyes. It was no longer vacant.
Then, the insane Psychiatrist moved his waist, letting out a
comfortable yawn.
Klein was momentarily at a loss, so he remained quiet. He picked up
a metal bottle containing the Amantha extract.
He dripped the transparent liquid extracted from the night vanilla,
Slumber ﬂower, and chamomile into the ﬂames of the candle
representing himself, allowing the serene aroma to spread around the
room.
Hood Eugen’s nervousness, anger, and relief completely vanished. He
languidly sat down again on the edge of his bed and looked out at the
crimson moon outside the window in a daze. His eyes once again lost
their focus as peace was restored.
Klein also felt the peace that came with the night. He set the
Amantha extract down and sat beside Hood Eugen. He wanted to ﬁnd
something to break down Hood’s last line of defense.
Only with the removal of the last line of defense could he use the Eye
of the Spirit medication to make Hood Eugen’s soul slip into a turbid
state.
After all, I’m not a professional Spirit Medium… He had already thought
of an idea before coming. He ﬁshed out a set of tarot cards from his
pocket.
This set of cards only had the twenty-two Major Arcana, so it was
easy to carry around. It was a “weapon” that Klein had successfully
applied for.
Each of the cards was lined with metal threads made from pure
silver, each of them was able to kill undead beings. Their patterns
were complicated and gorgeous, making Klein feel like they were a
collector’s item and not used against enemies.
Klein cut the deck with one hand and smiled at Hood Eugen.
“Let’s play some card games.”
“Cards?” Hood Eugen retracted his gaze from outside the window as
he repeated the term in a daze.
Klein didn’t answer, placing the deck of tarot cards into Hood’s palm
with a sincerity that could not be rejected.
Hood Eugen mimicked Klein’s actions, trying his hardest to cut the
deck with one hand to some success.
The attention of the mental patient was slowly drawn to the hard yet
ﬂexible, beautifully textured cards in his hand. He ﬂipped over the
ﬁrst card:
It was the picture of a man in tattered clothes with his hands tied. He
was hanging by his leg with a faint halo at his head.
The Hanged Man… Klein nodded in thought. He took the opportunity
to grab the Eye of the Spirit medicine, dripping the amber liquid onto
the candle ﬂame—still the one representing himself.
An alcoholic fragrance spread forth, inducing an intoxicated feeling
to anyone who took a whiﬀ of it.
Hood Eugen spaced out bit by bit, his vision losing its focus. The deck
of tarot cards in his hand fell onto the bed.
But he remained sitting upright, without slumping over.
Klein used Cogitation to ﬁght back against the medicine’s dreamy
eﬀects of turning light-headed and ethereal. He took out another
metal bottle from his pocket and twisted the cap open before pouring
the blue liquid into his mouth.
Sedative Agent!
The ice-cold liquid ﬂowed through his throat, down his gullet, and
into his stomach. Klein instantly felt unusually awake, without any
sense of drowsiness.
He slowly exhaled, then familiarly took out the other essential oil
extracts and herb powders, dripping them onto the two candles
signifying the Evernight Goddess.
In the faint fog, he took two steps back and solemnly murmured in
Hermes, “I pray for the power of the dark night.
“I pray for the power of the mystery.
“I pray for the Goddess’s loving grace.
“I pray that you would allow me to communicate with the spirituality
of the Beyonder beside me, Hood Eugen.”
…
The incantations reverberated around the room, and Klein saw the
ﬂames of the candle, now dyed black, spread outward.
He didn’t avoid them, nor did he guard against them. He allowed the
dark “night” to envelop him.
In this unusually lucid state, he felt his spirit leave the protection of
his body and enter a space akin to deep space. All around him was
boundless, silent darkness. The sky above him was ﬁlled with
countless indescribable, transparent ﬁgures. There were also streaks
of diﬀerent colors, lustrous splendors that harbored inﬁnite
knowledge.
The spiritual world… Klein was no longer a stranger to this.
Just as he had this thought, a foggy world appeared before him. It
was a world enveloped by a faint tornado of light.
Klein knew that it represented Hood Eugen’s spirit that represented
his Body of Heart and Mind. Thus, he leaned over, digging into the
wall that was the tornado.
In an instant, he saw countless specks of light pelting him. He heard
the voices of thousands of people discussing something in whispers.
These murmurings were very chaotic and lacked any sense of logic.
Some included praises for the elegance of some lady, then it turned
into a description of the feeling of relief after using the toilet. Some
started as a weep, then turned into frenzied joy…
The insane thoughts latched on and gnawed at Klein’s spirit in a bid
to assimilate him. But Klein maintained his lucidity and rationality,
quickly ﬂying towards Hood Eugen’s spiritual world.
This is like a pleasant concert compared to the horrifying murmurings and
howls I hear when entering the world above the gray fog… Klein smiled
secretly and made his way through the tornado. He saw a groggy,
translucent Hood Eugen.
This Sequence 7 Psychiatrist maintained the same state as he was in
the outside world. He looked over with a dazed expression.
Klein stopped before him and asked softly, “Do you know Lanevus?”
Hood Eugen replied blankly, “Yes.”
The light around them underwent a transformation as if Hood Eugen
was revealing his “spiritual sea.”
Quickly, the intertwining light revealed a bespectacled average-
looking man who wore a sarcastic smile. It was the same Lanevus
whom Klein had seen in the arrest warrants.
Klein nodded in satisfaction and collected himself. He asked a guided
question, “Why did Lanevus look for you?”
“He said…” Hood Eugen’s voice slowly turned soft.
Suddenly, he changed into a more charismatic voice and laughed a
little maniacally.
“Hood Eugen, this is the worst era, but also the best era. As long as
you seize the opportunity, we can become the rulers of this world, we
can become true immortals!
“As long as you’re willing to help, I’ll not only tell you the way to
master your potion and avoid losing control, I’ll also promise that
you’ll receive godhood qualities in the future—immortal godhood
qualities!
“You should be able to see the presence behind me. My promise is
‘His’ promise. In some sense, the Psychology Alchemists are
connected to ‘Him.’
“Do not doubt. The Psychology Alchemists aren’t strong enough at
the moment. It is unable to provide you with enough help unless
you’re willing to stay at this level for the rest of your life.”
The method to grasp your potion without losing control… Why does this
sound like how I entice others with the “acting method”… Lanevus sure
has lofty ambitions. He’s only a Sequence 8, yet he’s already talking about
manipulating godhood qualities… Just what hidden presence is backing
him… This guy seems to be plotting something, which isn’t solely just to
cheat people out of their money… Or could running scams just be his
hobby? Klein had many thoughts as he listened on. When Hood Eugen
stopped talking, he quickly pressed on, “What kind of assistance did
Lanevus want you to provide?”
Hood Eugen didn’t answer immediately, his spiritual world turned
silent.
He then broke out into laughter. He replied erratically, “Help…
Help… Help!
“Hahaha, I provided help! I provided help!
“I made…”
His words came to an abrupt halt as his blurry soul contorted. The
light and darkness of the surroundings which represented the
spiritual sea quickly turned incorporeal, forming a sinister, scary,
dark altar.
On top of the altar was a cross. There seemed to be something
hanging on the cross, as well as things that appeared indiscernible
piled at the bottom.
The light and darkness alternated, and as the hanging item was about
to become clearer, the entire spiritual world shook, as if it was
experiencing a magnitude ten earthquake.
Holy shit! Klein had a premonition that something dangerous was
about to happen. Without thinking, he turned and ﬂew towards the
chaotic tornado of thoughts in an attempt to escape.
Chapter 186: The Handsome
Captain
Countless rays of brilliance drowned Klein as ravings of a million
people ﬁlled his ears. However, Klein thought nothing of it. His
abilities as a Clown told him that his spirit was being engulfed by a
black shadow that was rapidly expanding.
The black shadow was a huge cross, and there seemed to be a person
hanging upside down on it!
Kacha!
The chaotic tornado of thoughts unleashed its load outwards and
turned uniform. Slowly, Hood Eugen’s spiritual world disintegrated.
Klein noticed that he had exceeded his fastest ﬂying speed from his
previous trial; his soul had become signiﬁcantly stronger after he
brieﬂy mixed with some of the strength from the mysterious space
above the gray fog.
Just as the cross’s shadow was about to engulf him entirely, he
dashed out of the blurry “world” and felt his body.
He familiarly stimulated a descent, and Hood Eugen’s long skinny
face and messy blond hair instantly appeared in his vision, along with
the three candles that were burning at the window ledge.
He had managed to get out of the mediumship state in time!
In that instant, he saw black scales growing one after another on
Hood Eugen’s face. His vacant pupils turned into slits, becoming
extremely cool and ruthless.
Oh shit! He’s going to lose control! Klein’s pupils constricted, and before
he could react, he saw a ﬁgure in a knee-length black windbreaker
and silk top hat take two huge strides before Hood Eugen. He then
raised the revolver and pushed it against the man’s head.
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Dunn Smith ﬁred ﬁve bullets consecutively. Hood Eugen’s head
suddenly blew up like a watermelon falling down from a high height.
The red and white rainstorm splattered across each and every corner
of the room.
He had taken care of Hood Eugen before he lost control completely!
Klein, who was ﬁfty centimeters away, was covered in blood and dirt.
He looked at Dunn Smith in a daze, only having the feeling that the
Captain was very handsome at that moment.
As long as you ignore his memory problems, the Captain is very
trustworthy… He complimented sincerely from the bottom of his
heart.
“Did an accident happen?” Dunn put away his revolver and watched
Hood Eugen’s mostly headless body slowly fall to the ﬂoor.
Just as Klein was about to organize his words, he saw that the body
had become a pile of bloody ﬂesh within a few seconds and the
asylum uniform that covered it appeared to have its most basic
structure damaged.
Hood Eugen’s corpse was left with very few complete items. There
were dozens of scales twinkling with a black shimmer, and his heart
that had turned crystalline and faint blue.
The heart had a magical luster, like a diamond refracting incoming
light.
It could calm someone down or make them restless. It could create
tension or develop chaos. But other than that, there was nothing
notable.
“This item should be controllable.” After Dunn holstered his revolver,
he took out a black glove and wore it on his right hand. He then
squatted down to pick up the crystalline heart.
A controllable item… According to what the Captain previously
mentioned, it could be used as the main ingredient for the formula of a
Sequence 7 Psychiatrist… But, would it lead to the advanced Beyonder
losing control even more easily? Klein took out his handkerchief to
wipe the blood from his face and body. He then picked up his
specially made tarot cards and cleaned their surfaces.
He looked at the ground and asked curiously, “What kind of items
would these black scales be considered as?”
“These are ingredients that are contaminated with Beyonder power.
They could be made into items that have long-lasting eﬀects. For
example, our demon hunting bullets’ ability to injure dead spirits or
monsters would decrease drastically as soon as they pass the three
months mark, leaving only a tiny portion of demon-hunting
characteristics in the remnant materials. If the materials used were
something like the black scales, the eﬀective period would be as long
as a year or two, and the eﬀects would be even better. Of course, due
to their characteristics, the black scales are obviously not suitable to
be made into demon hunting bullets,” Dunn explained as he took a
piece of paper from Klein to wrap the blue heart and black scales.
“It’s just like the materials we use as supplementary ingredients for
the potions?” Klein asked.
Dunn stood back up and nodded slightly.
“Yes.”
Someone who loses control will really become a monster… Klein sighed.
He seized the opportunity while the room was still sealed with a wall
of spirituality and quickly described his encounter in Eugen’s mind.
“When I was communicating with Hood Eugen’s spirit, I saw a ﬁgure
like the True Creator in his mind. But it was diﬀerent from the
mainstream ones. It wasn’t the chain-bound Hanged Giant, nor was it
the Eye behind the Shadow Curtains. Instead, it was similar to the
one you saw in Hanass Vincent’s dream.”
Hanass Vincent was a member of the Aurora Order. As Melissa’s
friend, Selene, had peeked at his incantations and completed the
magic mirror divination, it led to the Nighthawks’ investigation of
him.
Dunn Smith saw something close to the True Creator in his dream,
but it was a diﬀerent image than the mainstream image that was
widely circulated. In the end, the result was an injury and a strange
death.
When Hood Eugen ﬂipped over the tarot card of The Hanged Man,
Klein had actually already expected it. But he never thought it would
be presented in such a way. Of course, it was only indirect contact. It
wouldn’t be comparable to the time he had spied on the Eternal
Blazing Sun directly. The worst outcome was just mild injury or mild
corruption.
As he listened to Klein’s description, Dunn’s expression became
solemn.
He knitted his eyebrows and said with a deep voice, “A huge cross,
black nails, a naked man covered in blood hanging upside down?”
“I didn’t see it clearly. That’s also the reason why I’m not injured. I
only noticed a huge cross and ﬁgure similar to a man being hung
upside down,” Klein replied tactfully.
At that moment, all he cared about was “ﬂeeing”…
Seemingly in thought, Dunn nodded and said, “Lanevus’s visit to
Hood Eugen was related to the True Creator? So the Aurora Order is
involved?”
Klein quickly repeated the conversation he’d had during the
communication.
“Lanevus tempted Hood Eugen with the ‘acting method,’ and a so-
called immortal godhood. But I don’t understand why he said that it
was the worst of times, and also the best of times. Perhaps it was just
the way he speaks as a Swindler?
“… The help Hood Eugen provided involved a sinister and dark
altar… I suspect that Lanevus is plotting something terrifying…”
Then, his heart stirred as he spoke.
“Captain, do you remember the letter written to Mr. Z? The letter
that the member from the Aurora Order whom I killed carried!
“He mentioned in the letter that he was waiting for an appropriate
opportunity, something about the arrival of the end of days, he will
oﬀer all the lambs in Tingen to his so-called God. Would this be
related to Lanevus’s plot?
“Could Lanevus be the Mr. Z from the Aurora Order?”
Dunn Smith thought carefully and said, “I don’t think so. Lanevus
couldn’t be Mr. Z. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be setting up a fake
steelworks company to scam people while the Aurora Order was up
to something. It would introduce too many variables in his main
mission. If anything went wrong with the scam, he would draw the
attention of the police and us. He would have to run away from
Tingen and abandon his plan.
“Of course, if he was just insane, it would be perfectly normal for him
to act illogically.
“But judging from the scam he set up, the calmness and cunningness
with which he swept away the money doesn’t make him look like a
real lunatic.
“So, I don’t think he’s Mr. Z from the Aurora Order. Of course, he
might really be involved in the matter as mentioned in the letter. The
one oﬀering all the lambs in Tingen to the so-called God.”
Upon saying that, Dunn paused, then paced back and forth as he said,
“This incident might have quite severe repercussions. We have to
reinvestigate Lanevus and get some clues. Hmm, let’s clean up the
scene and cover up any evidence here. Let everyone know that Hood
Eugen died but leave no clue as to who killed him. This should lead
to action by the Psychology Alchemists or other Beyonders that are
paying attention to the asylum. They might know something.
“The Lanevus scam is either still in the hands of the police
department or transferred to the Mandated Punishers. We’ll join the
investigations by saying that we obtained clues while investigating
the Aurora Order. Then, we’ll work together with the Mandated
Punishers and the Machinery Hivemind. We’ll concentrate the forces
in Tingen and investigate everything and anyone associated with
Lanevus. We can request assistance from Backlund diocese and the
Holy Cathedral if it’s necessary!”
After that, Dunn turned his head sideways to look at Klein. He
ruminated and said, “Do you have anything that you’d like to add?”
Captain, you basically said it all… Klein shook his head solemnly.
“No!”
He hurriedly used ritualistic magic to remove some of the necessary
traces with the aid of the simple altar that he had yet to clear in
order to ensure that no one would be able to tell that they were the
ones who killed Hood Eugen.
Then, he put away his ingredients, blew out the candles, removed the
wall of spirituality, and left the ward in silence with Dunn Smith.
They left the asylum by climbing over its walls.
“Go back and rest.” Dunn stood at a corner without a street lamp. He
pressed his black silk hat and said, “there are many things that can
only be done tomorrow.”
“Alright.” Klein wasn’t a Sleepless who only slept two to three hours
a day. He immediately bade farewell to the Captain and took the
Nighthawks’ dedicated carriage that was waiting nearby and returned
to Daﬀodil Street.
Before he entered the carriage, he turned back to take a glance. He
saw the Captain still standing in the dark which even the moonlight
couldn’t touch. He appeared to be thinking in silence.
The streets were quiet and void of people before dawn. The carriage
tore through the streets, sometimes going straight, sometimes taking
turns.
Klein was pondering about Lanevus when suddenly, he felt as if he
was in a trance.
He saw that the color before his eyes become saturated. The reds
became redder and the blacks became blacker, just like an
impressionist’s oil painting.
The surroundings slowed down, and the carriage seemed to enter a
strange world.
Klein grabbed his Flaring Sun Charm and drew his revolver.
Just then, a huge, white, bony palm extended through the carriage
window and threw in a neatly folded letter.
Then, the palm pulled back and vanished. The oil painting-like scene
suddenly returned to normal while the carriage was still driving
along the street steadily.
… It’s a really well-hidden method… Klein looked at the letter, by the
side of his foot, as the corner of his lips twitched.
Chapter 187: Azik's Warning
The actions of the messenger shocked Klein for a full ﬁve seconds
before he recovered. He bent over and picked up the letter.
“Even if Mr. Azik is unable to use a good portion of his abilities as a
Beyonder, because of his memory loss, being able to send out such a
messenger should make him powerful enough to deal with a Sequence 7 or
6 Beyonder.” His heart reﬂected his shocked and envious expression.
He didn’t unfold the letter immediately. Instead, he placed the letter
into his pocket, together with the Slumber Charms.
The carriage continued forward. When Klein exited the carriage at
Daﬀodil Street, he instinctively looked at the driver, Cesare, only to
see his relaxed smile, as if he hadn’t noticed anything unusual that
had happened.
Klein nodded and returned home after observing Cesare with his
Spirit Vision.
He looked at the balcony and pipes on the second ﬂoor and pondered
for a few seconds. He decided to maintain his gentlemanly behavior
and not attempt to scale the pipe back into his room. As for his
stained clothes, he would take them to the Blackthorn Security
Company tomorrow and get a professional to wash them through the
police department. That would prevent his clothes from shocking his
maid Bella and his sister Melissa.
Klein had removed the reverse lock on the front door before he
leaped out the window from the second ﬂoor. Now, he took
advantage of the fact that it was late at night and quietly opened the
door to his house, deftly making his way in.
After closing and locking the main door, he heaved a sigh of relief.
He went up to the second ﬂoor with hushed footsteps.
Stopping before his locked bedroom, Klein took out a tarot card
calmly. He inserted it into the slit of the door and lightly pulled,
easily breaking the specialized lock he designed himself.
He then entered the room, locked the door, and removed his clothes,
before he fully relaxed.
It sure feels like being a thief… Klein laughed as he shook his head. He
calmly took out his revolver and placed it under the pillow.
After he was ﬁnished with all of that, he lit up the gas lamp and sat
in front of his desk. He took out the letter and began reading
seriously.
“I’m sorry for replying only now. I’ve been busy searching for traces
of my past. I’ve also been meeting up with former teachers and
students and those drag on late into the night.
“I ﬁnally understand the encounters that I’ve had over the past two
days after reading your letter. The police searched every room in the
hotel that I’m staying at. There was a person who secretly snooped
around in the hotel at night. Yes, I’m talking about a person with
Beyonder powers.
“… So Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos, who’s a frequent character
in novels and newspapers, has inﬁltrated Backlund and has gone on
quite a killing spree. I remember that he’s not only wanted by the
Loen Kingdom, he’s also on the bounty list of the Feysac Empire, the
Intis Republic, the Feynapotter Kingdom…”
So, how much is the bounty? Klein subconsciously wondered.
He didn’t get an answer because Azik had switched to mentioning
something else.
“I ﬁnd the abilities of a Shepherd that you described quite familiar,
it’s as if I’ve seen it somewhere, but I cannot remember where. It
must be an encounter from one of my past lives. Not being able to
recall it makes me very frustrated.”
Eh, Mr. Azik is a little interested in the Shepherd. I can use this to get him
to help me. Yes, this sure is coincidental… No, this is not a coincidence,
but inevitable!
It can be inferred that Mr. Azik has lived for over a thousand years and is
most likely a High-Sequence Beyonder. Then, he would most likely have
encountered the powers of many diﬀerent Beyonders in his earlier lives.
He would also have deeper impressions of those that were more unique…
In other words, it isn’t only the Shepherd that would give him feelings of
familiarity, but jobs such as the Unshadowed, Demon Hunter, or
Guardian that would do so as well…
It’s highly likely that Mr. Azik would ﬁnd any mystical item that
corresponds to a particular Sequence’s abilities familiar and have his
interest piqued. That’s something that can be imagined…
Klein was doubtful at ﬁrst before being enlightened. He was a lot
more certain as a result.
He shifted his gaze and continued to read the letter.
“I’ve long recalled some parts of the sacriﬁcial ritual you asked
about, probably because I have a deeper impression of them. Perhaps
I was a priest in my one of my more recent lifetimes.
“I have to remind you and warn you, that you have to be very
cautious when using sacriﬁcial rituals. You cannot entrust your safety
to evil gods or hidden, mysterious existences. They do not have
consciences like we do.
“Also, you have to possess a strong sense of right and wrong, for the
evil gods and devils often create seemingly harmless identities for
themselves. My opinion is that you cannot sacriﬁce something whose
presence you are not fully aware of; otherwise, your soul could end
up being the sacriﬁcial item.”
In simple terms, evil gods and devils will take on another form, disguising
themselves as someone trustworthy… Just like on the Internet, an account
that claims to be a seemingly adorable chick might be controlled by a huge
bloke… He had to be cautious even if they were to meet oﬄine after
conﬁrming the person’s looks, as the person might just be cross-dresser…
Klein didn’t disregard Azik’s warning just because he was conducting
the sacriﬁcial ritual for himself. He nodded in approval.
After Azik emphasized a few things he had to look out for, he quickly
explained the sacriﬁcial ritual he knew of.
“First, set up the ritual. Choose the symbols based on which deity or
unorthodox mysterious existence you are going to oﬀer a sacriﬁce to.
Use the corresponding herbs and minerals of ‘His’ or ‘Her’ domain. Of
course, you can also make them into holy oils, ointments, scents, and
other items in advance.”
Symbols? Klein froze for a moment. He realized that he—The Fool
that didn’t belong to this era—didn’t know what his corresponding
symbol was…
He thought for a moment, quickly recalling the complex symbol on
the back of his chair at the ancient bronze table. It was made up of a
Pupil-less Eye which represented secrecy, and the partial contorted
lines which represented change.
That should be my symbol, or more accurately, that is what symbolizes me
in the world above the gray fog. My domain is much simpler then—
secrecy, change, good luck… But I cannot be too sure of that, so I’ll have
to try it out… Even if the symbol is wrong, as long as I get my honorary
name right, the target of the sacriﬁce wouldn’t point towards some other
entity. The worst thing that could happen is that the ritual would fail. Of
that, I’m certain… Klein thought as he rubbed the surface of the paper
as he formulated a plan in his heart.
His eyes focused on the letter once again, reading the rest of the
letter.
“Second, you need to be clear if the sacriﬁce needs to happen at a
speciﬁc time. Then, follow the processes of a normal ritual, until you
ﬁnish reciting the honorable names and incantations of the ritual.
“You must remember to use either Jotun, Dragonese, Elvish, or
ancient Hermes. You must use the natural powers in these languages
to establish a direct connection with the corresponding entity. You
can design the exact incantations to use, but it must include these
critical terms: ‘pray,’ ‘notice,’ ‘oﬀer,’ ‘kingdom,’ ‘gates,’ and ‘open.’
“Finally, you must use materials that have a certain spirituality
quality to create a connection with the natural powers of the
incantation. This will allow you to construct a tunnel that connects to
the gates of the kingdom where the corresponding entity resides. If
the entity is interested, then your sacriﬁce is complete.
“This step isn’t absolutely necessary. If you can make the
corresponding entity very interested in your sacriﬁce, then ‘He’ will
open the gates to ‘His’ kingdom for you after you ﬁnish reciting the
incantations, establishing a stable tunnel on ‘His’ own accord. Of
course, this would often imply danger as the orthodox result as
relatively friendly hidden gods rarely do this. Only evil gods or devils
would reply to you directly in order to achieve their goals.”
Materials that have spirituality are not cheap… I wonder if merely reciting
the incantations would allow me to open a sacriﬁcial tunnel similar to the
Door of Summoning? I wonder if I could make use of the abilities of the
world above the gray fog… Yes, I’ll try that ﬁrst and only get the
materials with spirituality from the underground market if I fail. Do I need
Beyonder ingredients? It should be ﬁne if it possesses a certain amount of
spirituality, right? Klein thought about the 300 pounds lying around in
his anonymous account. He also thought about the 10 plus pounds of
savings that he had saved up.
Beyonder materials were not completely identical to materials that
possessed spirituality. For example, the heart that Hood Eugen left
behind was a Beyonder ingredient while the black scales were a
material possessing certain amounts of spirituality.
After he ﬁnished reading Mr. Azik’s letter, Klein rubbed his ﬁngers
together and ignited a ﬂame of spirituality. He burned the paper to
ash and threw it into the rubbish bin.
It was already deep into the night and Klein was in no hurry to try
the ritual. He intended to ﬁrst make a plan and go through
everything that he needed to take note of before putting it into
practice.
He had a vague understanding of his shortcomings long ago. He was
cautious and rational when it came to things he made plans for, but
once the events deviated from his original plans, he would easily
consider only the good and disregard the bad when he was forced to
be on his toes.
A simpler description would be that a rash action of his would easily
cause him to court death… Klein extended his palm to cover his face.
The next day, Dunn Smith, who had communicated with the
Mandated Punishers and Machinery Hivemind, started to assign
missions. Klein also received his assignment. He was tasked to
investigate a number of people who had connections to Lanevus. But
because of his suggestion and the policy of the Nighthawks, he didn’t
have to be responsible for the people he had met previously.
Of course, Klein continued with his combat lessons in the afternoon.
Nor did Dunn assign him the role of lead investigator.
…
Backlund, Hillston Backlund. In a building with a horse stable and
garden.
Qilangos, who had a unique wide chin and dark green eyes, looked at
the unconscious man before him. He took oﬀ the man’s clothes and
wore them.
He then leisurely walked in front of the dressing mirror and saw the
black glove on his left hand twitch. He saw many contorted lines
appearing on its back.
A few seconds later, Qilangos saw a thin veil of light envelop his
ﬁgure. His muscles, skin, and bones began undergoing a strange
transformation.
Sometime later, he transformed into the unconscious man,
completely identical in height, appearance, and demeanor!
Chapter 188: Ball
Sharp nose, thin eyebrows, slightly droopy cheeks, faint blue eyes…
Qilangos examined himself in the mirror. He was certain that he
looked no diﬀerent from the unconscious man.
After he rehearsed a few of the man’s gestures, he bent down to drag
the man oﬀ the ground and shoved him into a wardrobe.
Then, he extended his right hand. With an audible snap, he broke the
man’s neck.
Qilangos took out his handkerchief and wiped his hands before
closing the wardrobe door.
He slowly walked back to the mirror, wore a black double-breasted
suit, tied a bowtie, and raised a bottle of amber-colored cologne. He
dripped a few drops on his wrist, then dabbed them over himself.
Qilangos tidied his hair in front of the mirror, then walked out of the
room. He clasped his hands and told his butler who was waiting
outside, “Don’t let anyone enter my room; I’m keeping something
very important in there.”
“Yes, Baron!” The balding butler pressed his hand against his chest
and bowed. “Your carriage and personal servant is waiting
downstairs. Duke Negan’s invitation card is there as well.”
Maintaining the baron’s mannerisms, Qilangos nodded indiscernibly.
He walked towards the stairs in an arrogant manner under the
company of his butler.
Heh, a baron who is riddled in debt, to the point of not wanting to hire a
normal security guard, has actually maintained his hiring of a butler,
personal male servant, two attendants, two ﬁrst-grade maidservants, four
second-grade maidservants, two laundry female workers, one carriage
driver, one stablemaster, one gardener, one chef, and one sous chef. To
these foolish nobles, dignity really is everything… I even had to waste
some of my time to learn the strange pronunciations and so-called “noble
slang”… Qilangos thought to himself in disdain.
…
Backlund, Cherwood Backlund. In a particular cramped apartment.
Xio Derecha sat cross-legged on a bed and looked at Fors Wall who
was reading a novel with the light from the window.
“This is so disappointing. Qilangos didn’t leave any clues behind. We
still haven’t ﬁgured out what he’s trying to do in Backlund.”
They had acted according to their initial plan and lodged a police
report. Then, they secretly sent a letter to the local police station and
described the strange situation at the crime scene in detail. They also
mentioned that the suspect could be Qilangos.
The police station responded as they had predicted. The policemen
were very careful, and they transferred the case directly to the
Mandated Punishers.
After a day’s time, the news that Rear Admiral Hurricane had
sneaked into Backlund was widely spread among all “enforcement
teams.” Xio and Fors also left the place they originally rented and hid
to investigate in secret.
They didn’t want to be brought back to the police station to help with
the oﬃcial investigation. The Mandated Punishers, Nighthawks, and
Machinery Hivemind were all hostile towards non-oﬃcial Beyonders.
The Churches viewed them as potential criminals.
Hence, not only were Xio and Fors avoiding the possibility of
Qilangos’s pursuit, but they were also hiding from the “enforcement”
authorities.
“If we could discover his purpose so easily, Qilangos would’ve been
buried in a cemetery long ago, and the tombstone would be covered
in weeds,” Fors replied casually. “We need to wait patiently. As long
as the authorities continue to take this much interest in him, Qilangos
will deﬁnitely make a mistake. I’ve got to say, I’m quite envious of a
mystical item that can allow one to change appearances.”
Xio hugged her knees and looked out the window.
“I’m just worried that Qilangos will take action soon and then ﬂee
from Backlund before anyone can respond.
“If that happens, I don’t know when I’ll be able to advance to
Sequence 8, let alone Sequence 6 or Sequence 5…”
She paused and muttered as her mind spaced out, “I don’t know
when I’ll be able to take back the things that belonged to our
family… It’s been almost a year since I last saw my younger
brother…”
Fors gave her a comforting smile.
“When you fulﬁll your wishes, please allow me to write your
experiences into a story. It would deﬁnitely be an interesting and
exciting one.”
“Hmm, I actually ﬁnd Miss Audrey very generous. Even if Qilangos
escapes, I think she’ll still reward us handsomely. We’ve been busying
ourselves for so long after all, and we’ve even caused Qilangos to
appear.”
“I hope so… Sigh, why can’t I have any fortuitous encounters?” Xio
grabbed her shoulder-length blonde hair.
Fors frowned and said, “In the Beyonder world, fortuitous encounters
are usually accompanied with danger. I have yet to ﬁgure out what
the ravings we hear during the full moon mean, or if they will result
in negative changes. Heh heh, fortuitous encounters without dangers
may exist, but they are very, very rare. It’s diﬃcult for your wish to
be fulﬁlled, unless… unless we receive the favors from an orthodox
deity or the attention of some friendly hidden existence. However, it
would be hard for us to tell if it was really an evil god or devil in
disguise.”
Xio sat straight and drew a crimson moon on her chest.
“May the Goddess watch over me!”
…
Duke Negan was in his mansion located in Backlund, Empress
Borough, where he was hosting a grand ball.
There were two parts of the mansion. One was the dancing hall
located on the ground ﬂoor, which was covered with glamorous stone
slabs carved with complicated patterns. There was the duke’s
excellent ensemble playing music in a corner. Up the stairs, there was
a winding corridor that circled the hall located on the second ﬂoor.
The guests were holding their glasses, leaning against the railing,
overlooking the people dancing on the ground ﬂoor as though they
were enjoying a fencing match from the stands. Occasionally, a
gentleman would walk before a lady or his wife to invite them to
dance. If the invitation was accepted, both of them would walk down
the stairs hand in hand and enter the hall.
On the far side of the corridor, there were doors after doors. They
were rooms that had been allocated to the guests as their resting
quarters.
But behind a French door was a corridor, and on both sides of the
corridor were various gypsum statues. They were all the ancestors of
the Negan family.
At the end of the corridor was another hall which could see the ball.
Long tables were covered with a variety of delicious food and ﬁne
wine, and another ensemble belonging to the duke was playing
relaxing melodies for the guests.
In the hall, the guests were gathering in groups. Some were seated
and some stood around, chatting about all kinds of matters. Those
who wished to get away from the frivolities for a while would go to
the attached balconies to overlook the garden and enjoy the crimson
moon in the sky.
After participating in the opening dance, Audrey Hall stood on the
second ﬂoor above the dancing hall and stared at the candles on the
huge crystal chandeliers hanging from the rooftop in a daze.
However, she noticed that many young men were appearing to pump
themselves up to come over and invite her for a dance. So, she wisely
left the place and went to the corridor that connected to the dining
hall.
How boring, but my attendance is necessary… Sigh, can’t they just let me
observe in silence? I have to say, some people have rich facial expressions
when they dance. They remind me of animals seeking mates… Audrey
lowered her head, looked at the tips of her feet, and walked in a
straight line out of boredom.
Just then, the corner of her eyes caught an approaching ﬁgure. She
slowed down, stood straight, and instantly became the elegant yet
quiet Miss Hall.
“Good day, Baron Gramir,” Audrey greeted with a ﬂawless smile and
etiquette.
Baron Gramir had thin eyebrows and faint blue eyes. He smiled and
bowed.
“Nice to meet you again, Miss Hall. You are the brightest and most
dazzling gemstone at this ball.”
After exchanging a few words, Baron Gramir headed for the dancing
hall while Audrey continued approaching the dining hall.
After a few steps, she suddenly frowned. There was puzzlement in her
green eyes.
Baron Gramir isn’t the same as before…
In the past, when he sees a pretty lady or madam of a higher rank than he
is, and one that’s relatively prettier, he would look to the side without
looking at them directly. Then, he would steal glances constantly… But
today, he appears very conﬁdent…
Also, his cologne smells oﬀ. In the numerous parties in the past, his body
would emit the ﬁnal note of the Amber cologne fragrance, musky yet faint,
not ostentatious yet elegant. In other words, he would spray the cologne a
few hours earlier to let the front and middle notes disperse before the
gathering. But just now, his cologne was Amber in middle note, rich and
reﬁned…
Audrey slowed down her footsteps. As a Spectator who had
completely digested her potion, her sensitivity towards details wasn’t
anything other Beyonders could compare to.
Suddenly, she thought of a possibility. Her green crystal-clear eyes
froze.
It couldn’t be Qilangos in a disguise, right?
The Creeping Hunger has the power to change a person’s appearance!
…
The more Audrey thought about it, the more possible it seemed. She
felt uptight as she turned nervous and panicky.
If he really was Rear Admiral Hurricane, what is he trying to do? It’s a
pity that I can’t bring Susie to the ball. Otherwise, I could ask her to
observe Baron Gramir… No way, I have to warn Father! Amidst her
frantic thoughts, Audrey quickened her pace and entered the dining
hall. She found Count Hall who was talking to the Chief Cabinet
Secretary and others.
She ﬂashed a ﬂawless smile and walked over. She held Count Hall by
his arm and told the others, “Gentlemen, do you mind if I borrow
Count Hall for a few minutes?”
“Beautiful lady, it’s your right,” The few gentlemen said in a friendly
response.
Audrey held Count Hall by his arm and moved to the nearest
balcony. They found a quiet, uninhabited corner, and she said to her
middle-aged father who was getting plump, “Father, I have
something to tell you.”
Count Hall was smiling fondly at his daughter, but he got serious
when he saw her serious facial expression, “What’s the matter?”
“I ran into Baron Gramir earlier, but there are things about him that
are diﬀerent from the past. For instance, his cologne was in the
middle note of the Amber fragrance. It used to be the end note.
And…” Audrey continued with the things that she found diﬀerent. It
could be explained as being sensitive and meticulous.
After she described what she had noticed, she weighed her words and
added, “I heard from Viscount Glaint that Rear Admiral Hurricane
Qilangos has the ability to take on other people’s appearance. Hasn’t
he been in Backlund recently?”
Count Hall listened to her carefully, and his face grew abnormally
grave.
But he soon ﬂashed a smile and comforted his anxious daughter.
“I’ll take care of this. Go look for your mother and stay with her.
She’s at the lounge in this hall.”
“Okay.” Audrey nodded obediently.
On the way back to the lounge, she turned around and looked at her
father. She saw that Count Hall was talking to another noble softly,
and he wore a rather solemn look.
Audrey couldn’t help but feel anxious. She felt that she needed to do
something to make sure that her father, mother, and brother didn’t
get hurt.
She surveyed the area and changed the direction in which she was
heading in. She left the dining hall and found Duke Negan’s small
prayer room.
She pushed the door closed and locked it behind her. She looked at
the symbol of the Lord of Storms before her and subconsciously
found a remote and dark corner.
Audrey sat down with her body leaning forward. She clasped her
hands together into a praying position and supported her forehead.
Then, she recited softly in Hermes, “The Fool that doesn’t belong to
this era, you are the mysterious ruler above the gray fog; you are the
King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.”
Chapter 189: Prayers and
Replies
Tingen City, Daﬀodil Street.
Klein was discussing the latest play with Benson and Melissa and was
inviting them to watch it at the theater next weekend.
“I think the newspapers have said enough about it. ‘The Return of the
Count’ is deﬁnitely a play that’s worth watching. It’s already been
performed more than ten times in Backlund, and it sold out each
time. I think that we shouldn’t miss this opportunity.” Klein, who had
lacked sources of entertainment, was unwilling to give up. After all,
he had been an ardent follower of television shows back on Earth.
Of course, if it wasn’t for the maintenance of my image, I’d rather go to a
bar and play billiards… Yes, renting a venue for tennis isn’t a bad choice.
That can be considered as it’s a leisure sport for the middle class. With my
current ﬁtness, as long as I don’t encounter other Beyonders, I should be
able to handle most opponents easily… Forget it, it can only be a passing
thought for now. I still have to reinvestigate the ﬁgures associated with
Lanevus in the morning, go for combat training in the afternoon, and
search for the house with the red chimney in the evening before returning
home…
I sure am a busy man… Klein tried to remain optimistic.
Noticing that Benson was inclined towards his suggestion while
Melissa was still a little hesitant, Klein smiled as he added, “I heard
that the most popular supporting cast in ‘The Return of the Count’ is
a genius mechanic.”
“Alright, we do have to see a play at a large theater once in our
lives.” Melissa pouted and nodded her head grudgingly, but there was
now a sparkle in her eyes.
Klein was about to respond when he heard a buzzing in his ears. He
became dizzy for a few seconds.
Someone is praying to me… He supported his back with his right hand
and chuckled.
“Then I shall wait patiently for the tickets to go on sale.”
“Alright, I’ll be returning to my bedroom to write up a report.”
“We also have to plunge into the sea of knowledge and hope that we
don’t drown.” Benson let out a self-deprecating laugh as he returned
to the dining room with Melissa.
Klein went to the second ﬂoor and locked the door to his room. He
sealed the room with a wall of spirituality, then he took four steps
counterclockwise as he recited the incantations, returning to the
world above the gray fog.
His ﬁgure suddenly appeared at the seat of honor in the magniﬁcent
palace ﬁt for a giant. A pulsing crimson star reﬂected in his eyes.
Klein lifted his right hand and extended his spirituality, establishing a
connection with the star representing Justice.
With a boom, he saw a blurred, distorted image. He saw Miss Justice
in a long beige regal dress sitting on a chair in a dark corner. Her
head was bowed, her hands clasped.
At the same time, her still nascent and nervous voice stacked in an
illusory manner, reverberating around the space, “The Fool that
doesn’t belong to this era,
“You are the mysterious ruler above the gray fog;
“You are the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.
“I pray for your attention.
“I pray for you to listen.”
…
“I’m at a ball held by Duke Negan and encountered someone who’s
suspected to be Qilangos.
“He is disguising himself as Baron Gramir, and his motives are
unclear.
“I noticed today that some of the details regarding Baron Gramir
were a little diﬀerent than usual. This made me recall the
appearance-altering Beyonder power that Qilangos’s mystical item
has.”
…
Klein listened seriously and carefully interpreted what was
happening. Finally, he understood what Miss Justice was describing.
Qilangos has actually used the special powers of Creeping Hunger to
inﬁltrate Duke Negan’s ball!
But Qilangos probably didn’t expect that one of the ladies at the ball is a
Spectator, a Spectator who has committed the mannerisms of Baron
Gramir to memory! Hence, he doesn’t realize that he’s been exposed!
What does Qilangos want? And what should I do? I’ve tried conducting
the sacriﬁcial ritual without spirituality-infused materials over the past
two days and realized that I can create something like the Door of
Summoning, but I’m unable to open it. I was going to ﬁnd some time to
purchase some materials with spirituality in the underground market to
prepare for my second experiment. Miss Justice deﬁnitely wouldn’t have
spirituality-infused materials when she’s attending a ball… Klein thought
for more than ten seconds before beginning his response to Justice’s
prayer.
…
In a small prayer room in Duke Negan’s mansion.
Audrey repeated her prayers a few times before ﬁnally stopping. She
tidied her clothes and walked quickly to the door.
She knew that she couldn’t be gone for too long because her parents
would worry about her and thus misjudge the situation. It would
cause them to react in the wrong way.
Standing behind the door, Audrey took a deep breath, extended her
right hand which was covered in a white veiled glove, and released
the lock with a wary heart.
After leaving the small prayer room, she followed the path back to
the dining hall. She saw the ﬁgures holding wine glasses and plates
get closer when her vision suddenly turned blurry. She realized that
an illusory fog was spreading into the surroundings.
In the middle of the thick wide fog was an ancient chair, and atop the
chair was a mysterious presence, a mysterious presence that seemed
to overlook everything.
Mr. Fool! Audrey almost shouted in pleasant surprise.
She then heard a deep, familiar voice: “I’m aware.”
The voice reverberated around the space as the fog vanished.
Audrey’s vision was still ﬁlled with images of the long tables of food
and wine, as well as the bustling sights of interacting guests.
The worry and unease in her heart vanished as she subconsciously
straightened her back and entered the dining hall with light steps.
She walked toward the recreation room in the dining hall.
…
In the magniﬁcent palace in the world of fog.
Klein started to think about how to convey the message to The
Hanged Man after ﬁnishing his reply to Miss Justice.
I cannot just repeat the description to him since it undermines my
authority… After all, what mysterious existence would personally take on
the role of a messenger!? He deliberated for nearly a minute before an
idea came to him. He conjured the scene of Miss Justice praying and
transformed it into something akin to a movie scene with the faces
mosaicked and censored.
He then extended his hand and tapped, launching the scene into the
crimson star representing The Hanged Man.
…
Backlund, Cherwood Backlund. At the Holy Wind Cathedral.
The Hanged Man, Alger Wilson, was going through the investigation
reports in a simple room, trying to ﬁnd traces of Rear Admiral
Hurricane Qilangos.
Near his right hand was a stack of paper ﬁlled with many contorted
symbols.
Just as Alger was leaning back in his chair and rubbing his eyes, he
saw his ﬁeld of vision turn blurry. His line of sight was ﬁlled with
thick, gray fog.
There was an ancient chair which seemed to exist eternally, deep
within the endless fog. Atop the chair was a faint human ﬁgure.
Mr. Fool… Just as this thought came to Alger, he saw that another
hazy ﬁgure in a regal dress within the grayish-white fog.
She was in a praying position, repeating, “I’m at a ball held by Duke
Negan and encountered someone who’s suspected to be Qilangos.
“He is disguising himself as Baron Gramir, and his motives are
unclear.
“I noticed today that some of the details regarding Baron Gramir
were a little diﬀerent than usual. This made me recall the
appearance-altering Beyonder power that Qilangos’s mystical item
has.”
…
Alger was shocked at ﬁrst, then let out a look of pleasant surprise. He
pressed his palm against his chest and lowered his head, “Praise you,
Mr. Fool!”
Everything he saw or heard vanished before he ﬁnished his sentence
as if nothing had happened.
Staring at the desk strewn with Emperor Roselle’s diary pages and his
investigation reports, Alger’s pupils constricted as he realized how
powerful The Fool was once again.
This was the Holy Wind Cathedral—once the headquarters of the
Church of the Lord of Storms. Even though that was history from
more than a thousand years ago, many believers still viewed this
place as sacred. But Mr. Fool could still descend upon this space
without warning and give a reply…
After nearly twenty seconds of silence, Alger gathered his stuﬀ and
exited the room.
He was going to look for one of the Cardinals of the Church of the
Lord of Storms, the Archbishop of the Backlund diocese, Spellsinger
of God, Ace Snake!
For Alger Wilson, being able to kill Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos
personally was the best course of action, but if he was unable to do
that, guaranteeing that he was really dead was also acceptable in his
book!
…
After forwarding Miss Justice’s description to The Hanged Man, Klein
left the mysterious world above the gray fog and returned to his
bedroom.
While he was in no hurry to dispel the wall of spirituality, he sat
before his desk and took out a piece of paper. He picked up a pen and
began his letter.
“According to an urgent indication from a source, Qilangos has used
the abilities of a Shepherd to take on the appearance of Baron Gramir
and has inﬁltrated Duke Negan’s ball. His motives are unclear as of
this moment.”
Klein wasn’t worried that Mr. Azik would be suspicious of him or
doubt why someone in Tingen would be so quick to know something
that just happened in Backlund, for the telegraph existed in this
world.
“I don’t know if you would be interested in this, but I thought that I
should let you know.” Klein quickly ended the letter and folded the
piece of paper.
He then found the ancient copper whistle, brought it to his mouth,
and gave it a hard blow.
The gigantic, terrifying, and illusory skeleton messenger appeared
once again, still standing at its original spot, not minding that its
head was going through the ceiling.
Klein fought back the urge to use the abilities of the Clown to turn
the letter into a ﬂying dagger. He tossed the letter towards the
messenger without a fuss.
He then blew on the copper whistle once again to end the
summoning. Klein collected himself and went through the events in
his head once again.
This was all he could do for the time being!
Although Klein could also make use of the summoning ritual and
bring the Flaring Sun Charm directly to Backlund, it was too
dangerous for him to do so. First, Qilangos was a Sequence 6 Wind-
blessed and had with him the Creeping Hunger. Second, it was too
troublesome. He had to ﬁrst bring the Flaring Sun Charm to the
world above the gray fog. Third, his image would be aﬀected. Thus,
he wisely gave up on this idea.
To be honest, the problem is not too serious. Duke Negan is the most
inﬂuential noble outside of the royal family, a key member behind the
Conservative Party. There will be many high ranking nobles attending the
ball today. I have no doubt that there are Beyonders guarding the area. If
not for this consideration, there would have been no need for him to
inﬁltrate the place under a disguise… Since Miss Justice noticed him
early, the nobles should be prepared. This incident shouldn’t blow out of
control…
I wonder how fast Mr. Azik’s messenger is? If it travels through the spirit
world, Mr. Azik could still likely make it in time for the “main course,”
but if it’s as slow as Madam Daly’s messenger, then he might only read
about the incident in tomorrow’s paper…
Klein nodded indiscernibly and tossed this incident to the back of his
head. After all, there was nothing more that he could do.
Chapter 190: The Assortment of
Abilities
In Duke Negan’s mansion, in the dancing hall.
Disguised as Baron Gramir, Qilangos held a glass of blood-red Aurmir
grape wine and casually stood behind the railing on the winding
corridor on the second ﬂoor. He overlooked the people on the dance
ﬂoor and enjoyed the view of the glamorously dressed ladies.
However, there was no lust in his eyes; they were as calm as a frozen
lake. From the corner of his eyes, he stole glances at the hanging
chandelier and the nearby Duke Negan who was looking at the
beautiful ﬁgures passing by.
The Duke was wearing a well-ironed navy uniform with red ribbons
attached to the medals on his shoulders. He preferred to wear his
military uniform on formal occasions, in remembrance of his decades
of illustrious service while in the military.
However, he had put on much weight since then. His once-sharp gray
eyes had been left turbid and ﬁlled with desire. However, he took
good care of himself, as the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes, lips,
and forehead were faint, and his black hair was still thick and
luxuriant.
That was Pallas Negan, the current Duke Negan, the main supporter
of the Conservative Party, the brother of Prime Minister Aguesid, one
of the richest and most powerful men in the Loen Kingdom.
At the same time, he was also the reason why Qilangos had sneaked
into Backlund!
The thought of assassinating such an important ﬁgure makes me shiver in
excitement… Qilangos retracted his gaze and closed his eyes.
He was willing to accept the commission because he had been oﬀered
a suﬃciently attractive price, and it was also because Qilangos loved
adventure and enjoyed taking on diﬃcult challenges.
If this assassination is successful, my fame will spread across the Northern
and Southern Continents, placing me above the Four Kings. And I’ll
receive a card, a card which contains the mystery of God that the Emperor
Roselle created! Qilangos suppressed his excitement and lowered his
head to examine his left hand.
Creeping Hunger had become transparent. It was impossible to tell
that “Baron Gramir” was wearing a glove via the naked eye or
through contact.
This is such a magical item… If it wasn’t for this, a Sequence 6 like me
wouldn’t have achieved the rank of Pirate Admiral… Thoughts ﬂashed
through his mind as bouts of regret surged within Qilangos.
In his years as a pirate, he had seen and interacted with many
Beyonders. Among them were members of the Aurora Order who
enjoyed adventuring at the ends of the Sonia Sea.
So, he knew that Creeping Hunger was still rather diﬀerent from a
real Shepherd.
Firstly, the speed of switching states was too slow. It required at least
a second, but a real Shepherd could switch instantly. Secondly, the
controlled soul could only use one to three abilities before the person
died. As for what abilities could be used and how powerful they
were, that all depended on luck. On the other hand, a real Shepherd
could decide on the three abilities. They didn’t have to gamble like
they were at a casino. Lastly, Creeping Hunger could only have ﬁve
souls at the same time, while a real Shepherd could have seven.
Of course, both had the same restriction, which was that they could
only control one soul at a time, and they could only use the soul’s
corresponding Beyonder powers and their own Beyonder powers. If
they wanted to replace one of the souls with a new soul, the
procedure would be irreversible.
Qilangos went through seven or eight years of adjustment and ﬁnally
settled with ﬁve souls. Their abilities complemented one another and
made their owner very terrifying.
Because of the constant adjustments and experimentation that he did
over the years, there were rumors among the pirates that claimed
that Rear Admiral Hurricane was omnipotent.
During the ardent dance music, Qilangos rehearsed the subsequent
actions he would take in his mind. He sighed with regret in his heart.
It’s a pity that I didn’t ﬁnd the Traveler over the past few days. Otherwise,
I wouldn’t have to worry about anything tonight.
If he had captured the woman that was most likely a Traveler,
Qilangos wouldn’t have hesitated to feed one of the ﬁve souls that he
was grazing to the Creeping Hunger.
To him, a Traveler’s ability would be invaluable!
Qilangos stole a glance at the huge crystal chandelier hanging from
the rooftop and decided to wait no longer.
The soul that he controlled currently had only one ability, which was
to change his appearance. But it didn’t possess any power to ﬁght
against other Beyonders. However, the transformation ability was
still very useful, and Qilangos hadn’t been willing to replace it with
something else all this time.
The good thing was that no matter which soul he controlled,
Qilangos could use his Wind-blessed Beyonder powers at the same
time.
Finally, he acted as though his gaze was locking onto the curvy ﬁgure
of a noble’s wife before he swept it towards Duke Negan and all the
gentlemen around him.
Duke Negan is a staunch follower of the Lord of Storms, and he is a key
ﬁgure in the inﬂuence the Church of the Lord of Storms has on politics.
There must be a Beyonder from the Church of the Lord of Storms beside
him who’s protecting him. Although the Negan family isn’t an ancient
thousand-year-old family, he’s one of the wealthiest and powerful men in
the kingdom. He’s deﬁnitely searched for Sequence potion formulas in
secret or hired Beyonders… Qilangos’s thoughts surged. He mentally
eliminated gentlemen who were nobles and oﬃcers before locking his
eyes on the man who was constantly beside Duke Negan.
The man was brown-haired, blue-eyed, and wearing a black tuxedo.
He was almost expressionless while he remained vigilant of his
surroundings constantly.
Qilangos nodded indiscernibly and pressed his right hand forward
slightly.
Whoosh!
A sudden gust of wind swept in the area above the dance ﬂoor,
extinguishing the chandelier’s candles.
At the moment between light and darkness, while everyone’s
attention was drawn away, a few wind blades slashed at the same
spot on a metal chain supporting the crystal chandelier guised among
the gusts of wind.
Creak!
With a harsh, shattering noise, the huge crystal chandelier
plummeted straight to the dance ﬂoor. It made a loud crash, and
people screamed in surprise. Shards of debris ﬂew, cutting guests and
leaving them screaming in pain and fear.
The darkened hall was suddenly full of opportunities. Qilangos’s
glove squirmed and changed, condensing into a golden surface.
His expression was imposing and his eyes saw through the darkness
as he ﬁxed his gaze onto the man next to Duke Negan.
Suddenly, Qilangos’s eyes shone like lightning.
The Beyonder who was in charge of protecting Duke Negan suddenly
let out a tragic scream and fell on the ground holding his head. He
rolled around and struggled.
With a swoosh, Qilangos’s ﬁgure dashed through the darkness and
charged at Duke Negan.
However, in the deep recesses of his eyes, it reﬂected his target who
didn’t show any signs of panic. It was of utmost conﬁdence.
Duke Negan’s plump ﬁgure stood erect on the spot and observed the
incoming assassin as if he were looking down on him.
He lifted his right hand and pushed forward. He murmured in ancient
Hermes, “Imprison!”
In silence, Qilangos suddenly stopped. He was suddenly surrounded
by a transparent wall, something that wrapped around him like a
sticky liquid.
It made him seem like an insect in amber, or a prisoner in prison.
The leader of the Conservative Party nobles, the hereditary Duke
Pallas Negan was a Beyonder himself—a very strong Beyonder!
Duke Negan spoke in a low voice again and waved his right hand.
“Flog!”
Pa! Pa!
Qilangos seemed to be whipped by a shapeless whip. His clothing
tore from the whipping as his skin was lacerated, revealing white
bone.
Then, Duke Negan leaned forward and held his right ﬁrst. He
declared in an imposing manner, “Death!”
Pa! His arm waved as his entire body slammed into Qilangos’s head
with numerous afterimages. His ﬁst had struck his target’s head in an
unavoidable manner.
Kacha! Qilangos’s head shattered, but the surroundings shattered as
well. Duke Negan remained standing at his original spot. It was just a
dream.
It was unknown when the pirate admiral had already switched his
ability and entered the Nightmare state.
Unlike an ordinary Nightmare, he could still move his body after he
dragged people into a dream!
Qilangos stealthily appeared behind Duke Negan, and his cold gaze
locked onto the Duke.
Wrapped with high-speed spiraling winds, his right ﬁst stabbed into
the target’s vest like a sharp blade.
Whoosh!
Amidst the howling of the wind, Qilangos’s right ﬁst punched straight
through Duke Negan’s body and through his heart. But Duke Negan’s
ﬁgure rapidly turned transparent, just like a soul that was summoned.
After the nearly formless ﬁgure dissipated, Duke Negan appeared
before the French door on the other side of the winding corridor. He
wore a scrutinizing smile.
Another Beyonder… They prepared ahead of time? To lay an ambush for
me?
How is that possible?!
Although Qilangos was unwilling to accept this fact, he dealt with it
calmly.
The glove on his left hand squirmed and took on the form of dark
golden scales. His irises grew pale and became vertical.
Then, a shapeless wave swept from every direction. Ladies and
gentlemen were thrown into a state of uncontrollable fear at the same
time. They left their hiding places and ran around aimlessly. The
scene became chaotic.
The Beyonders didn’t dare to act recklessly as they were worried they
might hurt their relatives and friends.
Seizing the opportunity, Qilangos ran quickly as hurricanes whirled
around him. He smashed through one of the resting room doors
before smashing through an oriel window.
Amidst the shattering sound, he leaped outside and ﬂew a distance
away from Duke Negan’s mansion with the aid of the wind.
The moment he landed, Qilangos immediately ran towards a forest
ahead of him. It was a municipal garden—an escape route he had
scouted out a while ago.
Once he shook oﬀ his pursuers, he could change his appearance and
blend into the massive population of Backlund of more than ﬁve
million people.
That was also the reason why he dared to accept such a diﬃcult
mission!
After a while, there was gale blowing towards Duke Negan’s mansion.
The Cardinal of the Church of the Lord of Storms, the Archbishop of
Backlund, Spellsinger of God, Ace Snake brought a few Mandated
Punishers and ﬂew towards the mansion.
He couldn’t inform the other Beyonders in time.
Alger was one of the members that arrived with Archbishop Ace.
However, he was in a bad mood because he saw the broken windows
and the other Beyonders running out of the mansion.
It meant that Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos had escaped.
Chapter 191: Unclear Motives
Qilangos lost his pursuers with the help of the wind after crossing a
man-made lake.
He surveyed his surroundings, intending to create the illusion that he
had entered a ditch to escape into the Tussock River before turning to
the ﬁnancial center of Backlund, the Hillston Borough.
At that moment, his ﬁeld of vision suddenly blurred. He saw the
colors around him saturate in the darkness.
The green trees became greener, their red fruits even redder. The
dark blackness of the water became darker. Everything appeared to
be splashed with pastel paint.
Under the sky where the crimson moon was obscured, there were
many indescribable, transparent ﬁgures, as well as diﬀerent lustrous
splendors that contained mysterious knowledge.
Qilangos found himself coming to a halt as he ﬂoated in midair.
Beneath his feet, dark water continually rose towards him. Under the
water were pale white palms, reaching out for him.
Not good! Qilangos realized that he had been ambushed.
And the ambusher was deﬁnitely not weak!
A giant humanoid skeleton suddenly appeared before him. The
monster was four meters tall, and burning in its eye sockets were
pitch black ﬂames. The bones on its body were blurry and illusory.
Qilangos gave his enemy an expressionless look as he let out a sneer.
At the same time, the glove on his left hand released a radiant light,
appearing as if it was cast out of pure gold.
Qilangos leaned back and spread his arms wide, as though he was
trying to hug the sun.
A bolt of pure, burning brilliance descended from the sky, enveloping
the giant skeleton. The pastel-like world quaked in response, and the
pale hands under the dark water evaporated one by one.
This was the Beyonder powers of the Priest of Light!
It was a Beyonder power from the Sun Sequence pathway!
It was the nemesis of the undead!
The radiant pillar of light dissipated, and the pitch black ﬂames of
the giant skeleton instantly extinguished. It then turned transparent
as it disintegrated in the air.
Before Qilangos had the time to use the abilities of the Priest of Light
to dispel the pastel-like world, his expression abruptly turned rigid.
He saw another giant skeleton appear to his left. It was also four
meters tall, its eyes burning with a black ﬂame, identical to the
monster from before.
Immediately following that, the same skeletal monster appeared
around Qilangos, one after another. One, two, three… there were
more than a hundred of them!
More than a hundred pairs of burning black ﬂames cast their gaze
onto their target at the same time.
Underneath him, the dark water surface rose higher, almost coming
into contact with Qilangos’s feet.
Pale white hands extended outward, ﬂailing them around constantly,
as though they were grabbing at a life-saving straw.
…
“Spread out and pursue him. Try to corner him,” Instructed the
Cardinal—Ace Snake. He conjured a typhoon and took to the air,
ﬂying toward the direction where Qilangos had ﬂed.
Duke Negan and the rest didn’t join the ranks of Mandated Punishers
in consideration of their statuses; instead, they stood at the windows
or balconies to observe. It was also at this moment when the ordinary
nobles who were running around frantically slowly calmed down.
Due to the darkness and the undulating shouts, they were unsure of
what exactly happened. All they knew was that Duke Negan might
have encountered an assassin.
Alger Wilson clenched his jaw and ran out of Duke Negan’s mansion,
following the path of the municipal garden into the Hillston Borough.
He wasn’t willing to miss this opportunity, no matter how small the
hope was!
Suddenly, he heard a voice which was carried to him by the wind,
“There’s no need to continue the pursuit.”
No need to continue the pursuit? The voice of Cardinal Snake… Alger
stopped after just running a few steps forward. He turned to look into
the sky, puzzled.
He saw Cardinal Snake, who was wearing a black robe adorned with
many storm symbols, ﬂoating above the forest and the man-made
lake and staring down.
Alger creased his brows and sped over to where the Cardinal was
without considering the reason.
As he neared his position, he made use of his Seafarer abilities to get
a clearer look.
The Spellsinger of God showed no expression, but his posture made it
evident that he was serious. His exposed white hair that peeked out
from under his black hat swayed with the wind, accentuating his
stern silver eyes.
Alger retracted his gaze and ran out of the forest.
The scene of the calm pond reﬂecting the crimson moonlight
suddenly appeared in his eyes. On the pond’s surface, a tall ﬁgure
was ﬂoating near the bank.
That ﬁgure had a unique wide jaw, his brown hair was tied in a
ponytail. His dark green eyes were cold, yet blank.
Qilangos!
Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos!
Alger was taken aback at ﬁrst, then he felt both surprise and joy. He
couldn’t believe his eyes. and even suspected that the darkness was
causing him to hallucinate.
Before he could react, he suddenly saw Qilangos’s face rot rapidly. It
oozed a yellow-green liquid, his ﬂesh peeling oﬀ piece by piece.
Pat! Pat! Pat!
All that was left of Qilangos’s face was a skull, his two vacant
eyeballs fell from their sockets and onto the ground beside the lake.
Qilangos fell apart completely. His clothes draped over his rotting
ﬂesh and white bones and blocked the sparkling radiance.
In less than twenty seconds, one of the Seven Pirate Admirals,
Qilangos, had died mysteriously in front of Alger’s eyes.
This shocking scene was etched deeply into Alger’s mind. It made
him suspect if he was having a terrifying nightmare.
What was happening?
Didn’t Qilangos escape successfully?
Why did he die so simply, yet so mysteriously here?
What did he encounter, for him to lose his life in such a short amount of
time…
He’s a Sequence 6 Wind-blessed, the owner of Creeping Hunger!
Who did it?
What was the motive for killing Qilangos…
Just as countless ideas ﬂooded Alger’s mind, he heard Spellsinger of
God, Ace Snake’s, charismatic voice, “Did you give the information to
anyone else?
“Is there anyone else who knows of this information?”
Alger quickly calmed down. He glanced at Qilangos’s remains and
gave an explanation that he had prepared.
“I reported the information to you the moment I found out about it.”
He couldn’t help but grumble inwardly. If it wasn’t for the fact that Ace
Snake had gone for a walk along the Tussock River, forcing me to spend
time ﬁnding him, Qilangos might not have even escaped Duke Negan’s
mansion!
Of course, he didn’t dare say this in front of a High-Sequence
Beyonder. He could only respectfully and humbly continue, “The
personnel who received the information directly even sacriﬁced
himself for it, and no one opened the letter during its transfer, I can
vouch for this.
“But I cannot conﬁrm if there was a leak at the source of this
information. Since we could learn of it, others might have too.”
As Alger spoke, he formulated some guesses about who killed Rear
Admiral Hurricane Qilangos.
The person or organization who tasked Qilangos to assassinate Duke
Negan? Since Qilangos had already successfully escaped and there was no
threat of any information leaks, there’s no need to kill him… If it were
me, I would get Qilangos to lay low and try another assassination attempt
when everyone was certain that he had left Backlund…
Also, Qilangos only trusts himself, so he wouldn’t tell his assassination
plan to anyone. Duke Negan has been organizing gatherings lately in
preparation for his bill proposal in September, so there are abundant
opportunities. Other than Qilangos himself, there’s no one who can
correctly predict when he would strike. U-unless that person was a
Prophet… But that is unlikely…
Other factions? Not possible. Miss Justice prayed to Mr. Fool to relay the
information the moment she noticed a problem. There was no way another
organization could’ve received the information at the same time…
Mr. Fool… Alger was shocked as he thought of a possibility.
The person who struck was Mr. Fool’s adorer!
He happened to be in Backlund and thus lent a hand!
The more he thought about it, the more Alger felt that this guess was
close to the truth.
Only the members and subordinates of the Tarot Club could’ve
received the information in time!
Only the help of The Fool’s adorer could make it seem so mysterious
and without motive!
Just as he was immersed in his thoughts, Cardinal Snake fell silent for
a moment. He told the rest of the Mandated Punishers who were
making their way over, “Qilangos is dead. A High-Sequence
Beyonder, or someone who used a Sealed Artifact of a similar-level
killed him. But this is rather dangerous and highly unlikely.
“After a preliminary analysis, I believe that the High-Sequence
Beyonder is of the pathway of Death, perhaps a member of the
Numinous Episcopate, but not someone I know of. There’s also the
possibility of it being a member of another secret organization.
“The motive is unclear.”
The Numinous Episcopate originated from the Southern Continent.
Legend has it that it was ﬁrst formed by a descendant of Death in an
attempt to revive Death. They were nearly eradicated after the
Southern Continent was colonized, but they stubbornly survived and
spread toward the countries of the Northern Continent.
A High-Sequence Beyonder… Yes, only a High-Sequence Beyonder could
kill Qilangos in such a short amount of time! Just a mere adorer of Mr.
Fool is already at such a high sequence… That’s a Demigod! Alger once
again looked at the pile of ﬂesh and bone. He felt dissociated from
everything as if he had lost all his emotion. He stood there in a daze,
watching everything.
If I happened to betray Mr. Fool one day… He suddenly had such a
thought.
Immediately, the terrifying scene of Qilangos rapidly rotting
appeared in his mind.
Alger couldn’t help but shiver and lower his head.
At the same time, he relaxed.
Since he couldn’t escape or ﬁght back, then he could only choose to
be loyal.
Phew… With Qilangos dead, no one can threaten me with that secret
anymore! He exhaled, his worries completely vanishing.
…
In Duke Negan’s mansion, Audrey Hall, who was discussing the
assassination with her mother and the other nobles, saw her father
appear at the door.
She found an excuse and left the resting room for the balcony at the
main hall.
“Father, is something wrong?” Audrey looked at Count Hall with her
green eyes.
Her green eyes had come from her mother, not her father.
Count Hall smiled.
“It’s been resolved, my child. You need not worry any longer.
“Hmm… Did you tell anyone that Baron Gramir was an imposter?”
“No.” Audrey shook her head ﬁrmly.
I only told an almost godlike existence… She added in her heart.
She thought for a moment, then explained herself, “After I told you, I
went to the bathroom, then to where Mother was. You can ask her.”
“I see.” Count Hall nodded and didn’t say anything else before
mentioning, “Qilangos is dead. Someone killed him.”
“Who?” Audrey was as shocked as she was excited.
“No idea. We can’t even ﬁgure out why the murderer killed Qilangos.
It’s truly incomprehensible.” Count Hall paused. “Perhaps, it’s a
person or an organization, a secret and powerful organization.”
Unclear motive… A secret, powerful organization… Could it be Mr. Fool’s
adorer? It could be our Tarot Club! Audrey suddenly had an epiphany.
Chapter 192: Attention
Audrey analyzed many things at once as her mind whirled.
Mr. Hanged Man said that Qilangos was a lone wolf who doesn’t trust
anyone. Only he would know of his own plan. Other than my early
discovery of him, there shouldn’t have been anyone else who knew he
would attempt the assassination tonight…
I only told Father and Mr. Fool that I suspected that Qilangos was
disguised as Baron Gramir…
Although there’s a telegram cable in Duke Negan’s mansion and he
would’ve been able to send out information in time to ask for help, there’s
no reason to hide that… Dad’s puzzlement implies that the powerful being
that killed Qilangos wasn’t within their expectations…
Combining all of the above, I can almost be certain that the person who
killed Qilangos was Mr. Fool’s adorer!
Plus, only the unique model of the Tarot Club can create such a strange
situation with unclear motives!
Qilangos was a Sequence 6 Wind-blessed, and he had the magical item —
the Creeping Hunger. To be able to quickly kill him without leaving any
traces behind, it could only be a High-Sequence Beyonder known also as
Demigods, right? Or maybe he used a Sealed Artifact which possesses
immense danger?
Regardless of the possibility, it shows that Mr. Fool’s adorer is extremely
powerful…
Mr. Fool lives up to his reputation!
Regardless, I certainly provided clues, so Mr. Hanged Man has to carry
out his promise and pass me the pituitary gland of a Rainbow
Salamander!
This should be our Tarot Club’s very ﬁrst mission, right?
One of the Seven Pirate Admirals, Qilangos, died because of us!
Looking at his daughter who seemed excited, Count Hall, who was a
handsome man in his youth, coughed lightly and warned his
daughter with a mask of solemnity, “Audrey, I know that you’re very
interested in mysticism, and I normally tolerate it. But you mustn’t be
involved in this. You can’t even ask about it. You will be introduced
by the Queen to the Backlund social scene events by the end of this
year. As an adult, you should clearly know and remember that a
terrifying Beyonder, or a powerful, hidden organization, is equivalent
to danger. Do you understand that?”
“Yes, Father,” Audrey replied charmingly. “I was just a little curious.”
“Curiosity won’t do either!” Count Hall emphasized, and he couldn’t
help but let out a helpless smile.
“Okay!” Audrey nodded obediently.
I understand the whole incident better than you do anyway… She made a
silly face in her head.
Count Hall thought and said with a gentle smile, “Regardless, you are
the heroine tonight, the savior of Duke Negan. Half of the reason why
Qilangos is dead is partially because of you, and it’s the same with
the bounty. Of course, if there’s no one that admits to killing
Qilangos and comes to receive the bounty, the remaining half of it
will be yours too. Added together, it will be ten thousand pounds in
total.
“Hmm, the bounties set up by the Intis Republic, the Feysac Empire,
and other countries and organizations could be received as well. After
conversion, there should be about twenty thousand pounds in total.
“Duke Negan promised that he would give you his holiday estate at
Desi Bay as a gift. It includes a huge rubber tree plantation. I don’t
know the annual proﬁt exactly, but it deﬁnitely won’t be low. He
spent eight thousand pounds to buy it back then and later, even built
a house and purchased good quality seeds for planting.”
Audrey, who already had an inheritance of three hundred thousand
pounds, was considered rich. However, a reward that was almost
forty thousand pounds was still a huge amount of income. Many
noble ladies wouldn’t even receive such a ﬁgure as a dowry.
In an allied marriage of a noble and a businessman in August, Miss
Mary Oldbury, the daughter of a millionaire, only had an eighty-
thousand-pound dowry.
I never considered the bounty… Audrey muttered inwardly.
Suddenly, she thought of something. If she were to receive the
bounty and her name spread, The Hanged Man could easily ﬁnd out
who Justice was.
This can’t happen! As a member of the Tarot Club, I have to maintain a
sense of mystery! Audrey looked towards her dad and reorganized her
words.
“Dad, I’m a little worried…”
“Why? What happened?” Count Hall asked in concern.
“If it were to spread that I found out that Qilangos was disguised as
Baron Gramir, I’m afraid that his underlings would take revenge on
me. I’m afraid that whoever instructed Qilangos to assassinate Duke
Negan would target me…” Audrey tried to make herself seem pitiful,
weak, and helpless.
“I’ll hire someone to protect you,” Count Hall replied. Then, he
nodded faintly and said, “there’s really no need for you to take such a
risk. Plus, the person that killed Qilangos took the Creeping Hunger.
Of course, to a High-Sequence Beyonder, that wouldn’t be a strong
enough motive for interfering… Yes, I’ll inform Duke Negan to keep
this a secret and tell someone else to receive the bounty on your
behalf and compensate you in private.”
Then, Count Hall smiled and said, “You really are my daughter. You
earned forty thousand pounds so easily. This is more than one-tenth
of your current wealth.”
The three hundred thousand pounds was what he had set aside for
her in advance. He would still add in another part when she got
married as his daughter’s inheritance.
“Am I as good as you were?” Audrey happily asked in reply.
Count Hall shook his head and laughed.
“Much better than I was. The proﬁt from my very ﬁrst business
venture was only sixty pounds.”
Audrey suddenly became extremely thrilled. The satisfaction derived
from receiving a forty thousand pound bounty, getting her father’s
compliment, causing Qilangos’s death, completing an extraordinary
task, and the reward of a Rainbow Salamander’s pituitary gland that
she was going to get from The Hanged Man ampliﬁed her happiness.
I really want to report this to Mr. Fool to get his reassurance… No, no
way. A powerful, mysterious being killed Qilangos with an unknown
motive. There might be someone observing me in secret, looking for clues
regarding Qilangos’s death. I can’t show any hint of abnormality… Pui!
There’s nothing abnormal about me to begin with. As long as I don’t
attempt to recite Mr. Fool’s honorary name…
Hmm, if Mr. Fool’s adorer was really the murderer, He must’ve already
known the outcome. He wouldn’t need me to report it to him… Well… do
I need to share the bounty with the adorer? No, no matter what kind of
payment method is used to transfer twenty thousand pounds, it would
deﬁnitely draw attention. I can’t take the risk…
Plus, it has always been The Hanged Man who’s been asking for help from
Mr. Fool. Technically, he should pay the reward. Yes, yes, after all, he
declared that he had many pages of Emperor Roselle’s diary!
I’ll try to gather more pages of the diary to thank Mr. Fool for answering
my prayers. He deﬁnitely wouldn’t be interested in crass money…
Audrey quickly determined her next course of action
…
In Duke Negan’s mansion, in a secret study room.
The fat and tall Duke sat on a high back chair behind a desk. He was
smoking a cigar as he looked at the Spellsinger of God—Ace Snake,
Prime Minister Aiur Negan, and the others opposite him.
“Based on our current knowledge, we still aren’t certain of the
identity of the High-Sequence Beyonder that killed Qilangos.” Prime
Minister Aguesid Negan had just rushed over from the King’s side.
Archbishop Snake nodded.
“We’ve determined that it wasn’t any of the High-Sequence
Beyonders that we’re familiar with or the Numinous Episcopate
either.
“We have suﬃcient reason to believe that it’s a powerful, mysterious
Beyonder we aren’t aware of. Of course, we haven’t eliminated the
possibility that the person was using a dangerous Sealed Artifact.”
Duke Negan held his cigar and said, “Maybe it wasn’t just a High-
Sequence Beyonder. There might be a hidden organization behind
that person, a hidden organization that we don’t know enough about.
Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to lay in ambush for Qilangos so
accurately. Yes, perhaps one of the guests at tonight’s ball is a
member of theirs.”
His brother, Prime Minister Aguesid stated solemnly, “Regardless of
that possibility, we have to be careful. We have to quickly ﬁnd out
the identity of the High-Sequence Beyonder, the purpose of his
presence in Backlund, and why he killed Qilangos.”
A High-Sequence Beyonder that they didn’t know about, who
wandering in Backlund, was suﬃcient to draw attention from the
government and three major Churches!
Although a Sequence 4 or Sequence 3 Beyonder might not be able to
withstand the cannon attacks of their warships, there was no need for
them to experience a frontal assault. They possessed too much of a
mysterious power.
Hence, they were existences even more dangerous than ironclad
warships. Hence the reason why they were called “Demigods”!
Spellsinger of God—Ace Snake stood up and said, “Let me make some
arrangements and get into contact with the Church of the Evernight
Goddess, the Church of the God of Steam, and Machinery Hivemind.”
“His Majesty will allow the military and the intelligence agencies to
cooperate,” Prime Minister Aguesid promised.
…
In a hotel in the North Borough of Backlund.
Azik sat under a gas lamp and looked at the glove before him.
The glove was very thin, as though it was made from human skin. It
seemed that as long as it was ﬁlled with ﬂesh and blood, it would
turn into a hand.
Azik looked at it for a very long time. His face suddenly contorted in
agony and pain as he muttered, “I seem to, seem to have cooperated
with them before…”
…
Klein didn’t sleep well the entire night because he didn’t receive any
reports from Justice or The Hanged Man, nor did he receive any reply
from Mr. Azik. He kept thinking about the outcome of the incident
with Qilangos.
It must’ve been quite a scene if Miss Justice and Mr. Hanged Man
didn’t dare to contact me recklessly… But why didn’t Mr. Azik reply
to my letter? Did he not get involved, or was there an accident? Did
Qilangos hurt him? Klein extended his hand and covered his mouth
as he yawned. He got onto the trackless carriage that headed for
Zouteland Street.
“Extra! Extra! Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos killed in Backlund!
“Extra! Extra! Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos killed in Backlund!”
…
Just as the carriage was about to set oﬀ, Klein suddenly heard the
paperboy, which was also one of the Emperor Roselle’s inventions.
Klein was momentarily stunned as he quickly ﬁshed out a penny and
bought the Tingen Morning Post. Many passengers made the same
choice.
He opened the newspaper and quickly read the headline.
Pirate Qilangos shot dead by Duke’s bodyguard in Backlund.
Qilangos died? Mr. Azik did it? Klein fell into deep thought and
lampooned himself, As the boss behind the scenes, I actually had to ﬁnd
out the outcome from the newspapers…
Chapter 193: Coming To A Close
The article covering what happened to Qilangos wasn’t long, and all
it stated was the time, place, people involved, and the outcome. As
the saying goes, the more succinct the content, the more serious the
situation.
Something that happened in Backlund at eight or nine last night is already
being reported in Tingen City this morning. The spread of information in
this world isn’t too slow due to the exceptional contributions of Emperor
Roselle. It must’ve been one of the nobles or ministers who attended the
ball who leaked this information to some reporter, then that reporter used
the telegraph to send this sensational news to the news companies in
various counties…
The morning papers are usually drafted at night and printed after
midnight before being distributed in the morning. There was just enough
time to make changes and publish this article…
Just based on this news, the Tingen Morning Post would be able to sell an
extra thousand copies. And that’s only considering just this city…
Klein’s thoughts became more and more distracted before ﬁnally
calming down.
Since Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos is dead, that means that even if
Mr. Azik is injured, it wouldn’t be too serious…
If it was serious, he deﬁnitely would’ve been captured by the Mandated
Punishers or Duke Negan’s Beyonder bodyguards that were in pursuit of
Qilangos. And when facing such a situation, Miss Justice and Mr. Hanged
Man would deﬁnitely try their best to report it to me. The latter not
happening is enough to indicate that everything is under control…
Yes, if Mr. Azik doesn’t give me a reply, or if Miss Justice and Mr.
Hanged Man do not pray to me by tonight, I’ll blow the copper whistle
once again to summon the messenger and send over a letter of inquiry…
Relaxing, Klein shifted his attention away from the newspaper, then
he surveyed the public carriage.
Most of the people who could aﬀord transport like this could read,
and under the inﬂuence of the term “extra,” many had bought the
Tingen Morning Post. Now, a few of them were quietly discussing the
incident.
“The King of Pirates and the admirals have been terrorizing the sea
routes for a long time. They back oﬀ when they see the battleships of
the various countries, but they don’t pay much regard to merchant
ships… Even though Qilangos had only been inducted as one of the
Seven Pirate Admirals for less than a decade, he’s the ﬁrst to be killed
by the government…”
“Frankly, I’m curious as to what he was doing in Backlund? When a
pirate leaves the ocean, death is a foreseeable outcome.”
“Let’s hope that there will be a more detailed report in the future.”
“Holy Lord of Storms, I wish to know which of Duke Negan’s
bodyguards killed Qilangos. His bounty was a full 10,000 pounds!”
“10,000 pounds… If I had 10,000 pounds, I would immediately quit
my job and buy two or three medium-sized nurseries. I would invest
in the shares of some colonizing companies and railroad companies,
and receive a stable dividend every year…”
“That’s only the bounty of this kingdom. Intis, Feysac, Feynapotter,
and some merchant organizations also have bounties for Rear
Admiral Hurricane Qilangos. I sure hope that there’s a newspaper
that will give a full list of the bounties.”
10,000 pounds? Klein was shocked to hear that.
With his already impressive pay, he would have to take twenty years
to be able to save up that much money even without eating or
drinking.
If only… Forget it, there’s nothing I can do either. It would be impossible
for me to claim the bounty… He folded the newspaper a little
dejectedly and looked out the window of the carriage.
At this point, he ﬁnally concluded that the incident with Rear
Admiral Hurricane Qilangos had come to a close. All that was left
was to tie up the loose ends, such as the batch of Roselle’s diary that
The Hanged Man had promised him.
…
Backlund, Cherwood Borough.
Fors Wall and Xio Derecha were walking along the street towards the
nearest branch of the Varvat Bank.
“My money seems to disappear without me noticing.” Fors sighed.
Xio felt the same way.
“That’s right.”
“Luckily, my book, Stormwind Mountain Villa, is rather popular, and
there are still royalties being sent to my account. Otherwise, I’d have
to ﬁnd a clinic or a hospital and become a doctor once again.” Fors
let out a sigh, both in satisfaction and in worry.
Xio was silent for a moment before carefully asking, “Will the
investigation of Qilangos aﬀect your status as an author? After all, we
could be under the attention of the Mandated Punishers, Nighthawks,
and the rest…”
“No, the only one they would focus on is you.” Fors laughed. “You
were the one who sent someone to make a police report. Same for the
one who sent the letter and the one famous among the alleys and
gangs of the East Borough. As for me, Fors Wall, I’m still the popular
best-selling author.”
Xio said in a daze, “So you’ve just been accompanying me all this
time?”
Fors stroked her hair and laughed.
“Don’t you ﬁnd that this was an interesting experience? This
experience has provided me with the much-needed inspiration for my
work. My next novel will be about a sudden brutal murder.”
Xio paused, not knowing how to continue the conversation. All she
could do was continue walking forward bitterly, forgetting to make a
turn until Fors dragged her back.
At that moment, they heard a paperboy shout.
“Extra! Extra! Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos killed in Backlund!”
…
Ah? What? Xio and Fors looked at each other in confusion.
They only came to their senses after the paperboy repeated himself
multiple times.
“What? Qilangos is dead?” Fors couldn’t believe what she was
hearing.
“He’s dead! How did he die so suddenly!” Xio, who was trying to hide
from the prosecution of this merciless pirate, was shocked and dazed.
This… doesn’t this have to follow a normal procedure? First, they ﬁnd
clues to conﬁrm Qilangos’s motive, then they would gather powerful
Beyonders and ambush him. Killing the pirate was the last step… But,
Qilangos was killed even though the ﬁrst step hadn’t been completed yet…
He died just like that… Fors and Xio exchanged looks as if they were
two marble statues.
Nearly a minute later, Xio charged towards the paperboy and bought
a copy of the Tussock Times.
This was one of the three most distributed newspapers in the Loen
Kingdom.
“Oh… Qilangos is really dead, killed by Duke Negan’s bodyguard. Oh
Goddess, Negan’s bodyguard is…” Xio gasped, leaving out the “a
powerful Beyonder,” that she had wanted to say.
Fors looked at her good friend in pity.
“To think that you would believe everything the newspapers say…”
“Alright, perhaps someone realized Qilangos’s motive in advance, and
the Mandated Punishers, Nighthawks, Machinery Hivemind, and the
military cooperated and executed a successful ambush…” Xio froze
and exhaled. “We don’t need to worry about it any longer. We can go
back to our normal lives, but we have to avoid the sphere of
inﬂuence of that police station from before.”
She looked at Fors and asked, a little worried, “How much do you
think Miss Audrey will pay us now? I know that a few hundred
pounds wouldn’t be too much to her, but we haven’t really completed
what she asked of us…”
“No, at least we made Qilangos appear on his own accord. The reason
he rushed to take action and fall for the ambush was deﬁnitely in
some part due to our contributions,” Fors consoled her. “With Miss
Audrey’s generosity, she’ll give us half the reward even if she’s not
giving us all of it.”
“Let’s hope so…” Xio took in a deep breath and had an expectant
gaze. “I wonder who will claim that bounty of 10,000 pounds…”
“It sure invites the envy of others. If I had that much money, I’d have
become a Sequence 7 or 6 long ago, but I missed the opportunity
time and time again!” Fors also felt a little sorry, but she reminded
her friend, “Xio, let us not contact Miss Audrey for the time being.
Let her contact us on her own accord. There are too many hidden
details surrounding the death of Qilangos. Looking for Miss Audrey
abruptly could put us in a dangerous situation.”
Xio ﬁrst nodded before saying in surprise, “How did you know that I
was thinking of heading to Empress Borough?”
“Try guessing?” Fors laughed in response.
…
After a busy morning, Klein returned to the Blackthorn Security
Company. He reported to Dunn Smith, “Captain, the people
connected to Lanevus that I’m in charge of investigating have no
problems. They were merely victims, not associated with any
Beyonder incidents.”
Dunn placed both his elbows on his desk.
“Then stop that for the time being. We shall place our focus on the
more likely suspects after the rest of the members have ﬁnished with
their investigations. We cannot direct all our manpower onto this
incident. We have to guard against other sudden incidents.”
“Alright.” Klein was about to stand up and head to lunch when he
suddenly heard knocking on the door.
“Please enter,” Dunn said in his mellow voice.
The handle moved and Rozanne peeked inside.
“Captain, someone is here with a mission.”
A mission… This seems to be targeted at the Blackthorn Security
Company and not the Nighthawks Squad. So, who mistakenly came to us
this time? Klein wondered to himself.
Dunn thought for a moment before saying, “We can go hear the
request out and reject it if it’s too troublesome.”
He arranged his shirt and vest as he walked out of the oﬃce. He
made his way through the partition and towards the sofa in the
receptionist area. Klein and Rozanne followed curiously behind.
There were two ladies on the sofa, both of them were wearing black
hats and dresses without any extra color.
One of the ladies was plump and had fair skin. Her face was
completely obscured by the black veil of her hat.
Klein felt a sense of familiarity when he saw her, as though he had
seen her somewhere before.
Just as he was recalling, he heard the skinnier lady beside her speak.
“The mission we would like to entrust to you is for you to track and
monitor Madam Sharon and ﬁnd evidence of her crimes.”
Madam Sharon… Klein suddenly had an epiphany, and recalled where
the sense of familiarity came from.
The lady that remained silent was the wife of Member of Parliament
Maynard, the daughter of the New Party’s leader.
She ﬁnds it hard to accept the death of her husband and is unwilling to
accept the conclusion the police department came to, so she came to a
security company in private to do another investigation?
To think that she came directly to us… Klein shook his head and
laughed to himself.
Chapter 194: Inﬁltration
“Madam Sharon?” Dunn obviously knew of Baron Khoy’s widow, a
famous socialite in Tingen.
Maynard’s wife turned her head to shoot a glance at the scrawny lady
who came with her to the Blackthorn Security Company, but she
didn’t speak for herself.
The scrawny lady in the black dress and hat weighed her words
before she spoke.
“Yes, Madam Sharon, the wife of the deceased Baron Khoy. She,
she…”
She stammered, then suddenly spat in anger, “She’s a b*tch!”
Upon hearing her curse, Klein suddenly recalled the porno that he
had seen and Madam Sharon’s behavior which appeared nervous on
the surface but was calm deep down. That made him believe the
rumors about her, and he felt sorry for the deceased old baron.
It’s not like Madam Sharon can’t remarry. But her loose behavior… really
makes the old baron’s grave a perfect nesting ground for cuckoos…
Dunn didn’t have much of a change in his facial expression. He sat on
the sofa opposite and said with his mellow voice, “But that doesn’t
make her a criminal.
“You know clearly, and I know it clearly too. Madam Sharon is very
inﬂuential in Tingen. If we were to follow her and monitor her, there
could be very serious consequences for us.”
“She’s a criminal!” the scrawny lady said angrily. “She caused my
brother’s death, but those lovers of hers pressured the police
department and made them pronounce that my brother died of
excessive drinking and continuous indulgence in sexual pleasure. Th-
they are all criminals!”
Those… Klein realized that the scrawny lady was Maynard’s sister
while feeling sorry for the old baron once again.
That’s right, for such a scandal, she would deﬁnitely not send a
maidservant here. It’s better if the request is made by family… He
nodded his head in enlightenment.
Mrs. Maynard patted the back of the scrawny woman’s hand and
added with a deep yet cold voice, “She’s a criminal! If you suﬀer any
damages because of this, I will compensate you for your losses.”
That tone… She lives up to her identity as the daughter of the New Party’s
head. If the police department wasn’t very conﬁdent with the result of my
mediumship ritual, I’m afraid they would’ve submitted under her
pressure… Klein lampooned inwardly.
Dunn was silent for nearly twenty seconds before he said, “Alright… I
have another question. Why do you seem to be so certain that we
would ﬁnd something?”
The scrawny lady nodded and said, “The tobacco merchant, Vickroy,
introduced us here. He said that you’re the cream of the crop in this
industry and can complete missions that others aren’t capable of
completing.”
The tobacco merchant Vickroy… Who’s he? Klein looked at Captain
subconsciously and noticed that Dunn Smith looked really confused.
I’m so silly, why did I hope for Captain to remember something like this…
After all, even I don’t quite remember… He sighed.
The scrawny lady saw that the two elite mercenaries looked
confused, so she added, “You saved his kidnapped son.”
Oh, him… That kidnap case led me to the discovery of the Antigonus
family’s notebook… Klein was suddenly enlightened.
Dunn nodded slightly and said, “I understand.”
Upon seeing this, the scrawny woman laid out her oﬀer, “You are to
tail and monitor th-that b*tch for two weeks. Even if you don’t ﬁnd
any evidence of her crime, you have to take note of who visited her
and who she visited. We will pay ﬁfty pounds for this.
“And if you ﬁnd evidence of her crimes, we would pay another
additional two hundred pounds.”
That’s a large sum of money… When Klein suddenly recalled that he
had only spent seven pounds to hire Detective Henry to gather so
much information about red chimney houses, he became a little
ashamed.
Dunn thought for a moment before saying, “No problem, we can sign
the contract now. You’ll have to pay a deposit of twenty pounds up
front.”
Captain, we’re really lacking in manpower right now. There’s the huge
case regarding Lanevus… Klein didn’t expect Dunn Smith to accept the
mission although he, himself, was quite keen on accepting it.
Mrs. Maynard nodded slightly and said, “No problem. I believe in
you. Please don’t disappoint me.”
Dunn smiled but kept quiet. He turned his head and told Rozanne,
“Please write up a contract.”
When the contract was signed and the deposit was paid, Dunn
watched Mrs. Maynard and the scrawny lady leave the Blackthorn
Security Company. He then looked sideways at Klein and said, “This
mission will be yours.”
“Huh?” Klein looked confused.
Dunn smiled and said, “Didn’t you want to learn tailing techniques
and monitoring skills? This is a great opportunity. It also turns out
that you’re done with your part in the Lanevus case.”
“Alright…” Klein didn’t reject the assignment.
Just as he accepted, his mind began whirling quickly.
According to the rules, half of the mission’s commission is handed to Mrs.
Orianna as additional funding for the team. The remaining would be split
among the involved members. However, it seems like I’m the only one
handling the case…
Regardless of whether the investigation succeeds, there will be at least
twenty-ﬁve pounds of income. On top of that, I’ll receive my usual weekly
pay… If I really could ﬁnd some clues, I could even receive a hundred and
twenty-ﬁve pounds!
Captain is a wise man!
Dunn stole a glance at him and said, “Learn the tailing techniques
and monitoring skills from Leonard and Frye in the morning, and put
your combat training on hold for this week. Yes… I think you’re quite
well-trained already, so I’ll send someone to inform Gawain.”
Learn tailing techniques and monitoring skills from Leonard and Frye?
That doesn’t seem very reliable… Klein was stunned. He could imagine
Leonard using only one method which was playing his Feynapotter
lute while singing melodious poetry. Then, he would probably seduce
Madam Sharon to bed in order to “monitor her up close.” As for Frye,
he had a unique air to him. He was cold and gloomy, so no matter
where he went, he would catch the attention of others. How could
such people make good spies?
As his thoughts churned, Klein replied seriously, “Alright.”
Dunn nodded slightly and walked towards the partition. Suddenly, he
paused, turned around, and hesitated before he spoke.
“Do you remember the tobacco merchant? What’s was the kidnapping
about?”
… So you didn’t remember anything or understood anything… Why were
you acting so staid and conﬁdent!? Klein facepalmed.
…
Based on Leonard’s guidance, Klein wasn’t in a hurry to tail Madam
Sharon, even though he knew that she stayed on Osna Street in the
East Borough.
“Until you know the target’s routine, you can’t tail your target recklessly.
Plus, monitoring alone makes it diﬃcult to take note of everything. Unless
you don’t eat, drink, sleep, and go home,” Leonard had said. Hence,
Klein followed his suggestion and found one of the triad bosses in the
Hound Pub and spent ﬁve pounds to get his underlings to monitor
Madam Sharon and record her daily routine.
Luckily, this can be reimbursed… Why does it feel like I’m
subcontracting… On Friday afternoon, Klein received the investigation
report from the triad boss.
Calling it an investigation report was an obvious insult to
professional detectives. Not one of the triad boss’s underlings was
literate. They relied on drawings and symbols, which was then
interpreted and organized by their semi-literate boss who had
attended Sunday School for a year. Klein got a headache just from
reading it and took quite a while to ﬁnish reading the report.
According to the surveillance, Madam Sharon seldom leaves her place
recently. There aren’t many guests who visit either… She might be aﬀected
by Maynard’s death… Those triad underlings are quite capable. They even
gathered information from Madam Sharon’s maidservant… Hmm, she will
be attending the Conservative Party’s banquet tonight. She might return
home quite late, or maybe not return… This is an opportunity for me to
put theory into practice. Klein quickly decided to sneak into Madam
Sharon’s house and search through it.
With his duties regarding the Lanevus case over, the temporary
suspension of combat training, and the end of the Qilangos incident,
Klein only had two matters on hand. One was to investigate the red
chimney houses, and the second was following and monitoring
Madam Sharon. In other words, he was relatively free.
Two days ago, he had received Mr. Azik’s reply. There was only one
sentence on the letter.
“I obtained the Creeping Hunger and recalled something.”
Klein had ﬁnally conﬁrmed that it was Mr. Azik who killed Qilangos
and that this amnesiac teacher of his who had a long life was a High-
Sequence Beyonder. However, he didn’t dare ask him what he had
recalled with the aid of the Creeping Hunger. Azik obviously didn’t
want to talk about it. If he was willing to share, he would’ve
described it directly in the letter.
In Klein’s reply, he only reminded Mr. Azik that the Creeping Hunger
yearned for the ﬂesh, blood, and soul of living humans. He had to
ﬁnd a safe sealing method.
In addition, Justice and The Hanged Man had yet to pray to him, but
Klein wasn’t worried. He understood that both members were afraid
of being monitored, so they didn’t recite his name recklessly.
…
Gas street lamps illuminated the straight Osna Street at night while
the crimson moon hung high above.
Klein, who had sneaked out with the Clown’s balance and agility,
leaped over the outer wall of Madam Sharon’s house quietly.
Passing through the garden, he arrived by the side of the house. He
climbed up the water pipe and slipped onto the balcony on the
second ﬂoor.
Klein had never even climbed a tree successfully when he was young,
so it was quite a monumental event.
He took out a tarot card from the pocket of his black windbreaker,
slotted it into the gap of the balcony door, lifted it lightly, and
unlocked the door.
The servants are so careless… They didn’t use an additional lock.
Otherwise, I’d have to try entering by climbing through the window…
Klein muttered silently and entered the house.
Based on the information provided by the triad boss, he found
Madam Sharon’s bedroom easily. He turned the knob and stepped
into the room.
He closed the door carefully and suddenly smelled a faint fragrance.
It reminded him of the fragrance of a woman that caused the blood
vessels of other people to swell.
Klein felt a little faint, and he even felt his body reacting.
He immediately calmed down with Cogitation and made a self-
deprecating comment, “She’s using an aphrodisiac as perfume?”
Chapter 195: “Lockpicking
Expert” Klein
A few seconds later, Klein activated his Spirit Vision and surveyed the
room, only to ﬁnd how extravagantly decorated Madam Sharon’s
room was.
In a spacious area with a cloakroom that was ajar, there was a thick
carpet, a blanket made with goose feathers, a makeup table strewn
with skin care products and cosmetics, a dazzling array of jewelry,
thin clothing and socks thrown over the rocking chair, and multiple
decorative items adorned with gold silk. All of these entered Klein’s
ﬁeld of vision.
What attracted Klein’s attention the most was an unﬁnished oil
painting. On the painting was the naked ﬁgure of Madam Sharon
herself—her brown hair like a waterfall, her eyes like an innocent
deer’s, pure and limpid. But her curved eyebrows, sharp nose, and
tender lips accentuated her form as a mature female. The two
qualities fused together despite the contradiction, releasing an
alarming temptation.
Klein only gave a cursory glance at the area under the neck for a
moment. He wasn’t trying to be gentlemanly. After all, he had
already seen the porno, so why would he have scruples over a
picture?
His attention had been grabbed by the pastels, palettes, and
paintbrushes beside the painting, as well as a full-length silver-coated
mirror.
This combination and their placement relative to each other gave
Klein a weird thought that the painter was Madam Sharon herself,
and not some artist she had seduced.
A beautiful woman with a great ﬁgure, ﬂirtatious yet innocent, stripping
and drawing herself while looking in the mirror to chronicle her beauty…
It feels a little odd. Is Madam Sharon narcissistic? Klein gulped silently
and retracted his gaze. He started to search for possible evidence of
her crimes.
Following Leonard’s and Frye’s instructions, he kept his black gloves
on as he searched. He had to keep the original position of everything
in his memory to facilitate putting everything back after he was done.
This proved easy for an advanced Seer. If he forgot, he could use
dream divination to recall the placement easily.
Of course, he had performed a divination before he left the house
tonight. There was going to be no danger and he would be met with
relative success.
That’s something a good charlatan would do… even if I’m already a
Clown… Klein lampooned himself. He spent twenty minutes
searching Madam Sharon’s room, but he didn’t ﬁnd anything
noteworthy, nor did he see any light emitted by spirituality.
Finally, he stopped before a safe in the corner of the room.
The steel safe was a meter tall; thick and heavy. It gave the
impression that it was unusually sturdy, as if it could only be opened
using explosives.
This sure is a characteristic of the Age of Steam. There must be
complicated machinery within the safe… Klein tried to open the safe but
failed miserably.
He left the safe for last. He took oﬀ his left glove and unwound the
topaz dangling on his left wrist.
Grabbing the silver chain and allowing the pendulum to fall, Klein
dispelled the excitement that the fragrance in the room gave him and
entered a state of Cogitation.
His eyes turned dark as he chanted to himself, “There is a secret
room or hidden partition in this room.
“There is a secret room or hidden partition in this room.”
…
After reciting it seven times, Klein’s eyes regained their normal color.
He looked at the dangling topaz, which was turning
counterclockwise.
It was a negative result.
Klein nodded slightly and left Madam Sharon’s room. According to
the process from before, he went through the study, the living room,
the greenhouse, and other parts of the house, but he didn’t ﬁnd any
clues of value.
He didn’t use Dowsing Rod Seeking since he didn’t exactly know
what he was looking for.
Klein took out his silver pocket watch and gave it a look. He
conﬁrmed the time before returning to Madam Sharon’s bedroom.
Carefully closing the wooden door, Klein took out the silver dagger
used for rituals and released his spirituality, allowing it to fuse with
the powers of nature and seal the room.
He was going to summon himself!
He was going to go through the safe using his spirit and check the
things inside!
Grandpa doesn’t need to know how to lockpick! Klein proclaimed in
Mandarin.
The process was simple since he was praying to himself. He didn’t
have to be too particular. Klein took out a candle infused with
sandalwood and ignited it using his spirituality. That was going to be
his altar.
“I!
“I summon in my name:
“The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era, the mysterious ruler above
the gray fog; the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.”
The incantation reverberated around Madam Sharon’s bedroom.
Klein’s spirituality poured out from within him, gently fusing with
the candle ﬂame to become a gray, palm-sized veil of light.
He then took four steps counterclockwise, made his way through the
mad ravings, and into the world above the gray fog.
He saw the Door of Summoning appear behind the seat of honor at
the ancient long table. Klein was about to react when he froze.
I should perform a divination to see if I can discover any clues since I’m
already here. Here, as well as removing any interference, my powers are
also signiﬁcantly boosted… Also, because of where I am now, performing
a divination is akin to using an object Madam Sharon brings around with
her everyday… He sat down and conjured a fountain pen and
goatskin.
What should I divine? Klein slipped into deep thought .
Is there anything wrong with Madam Sharon?
No, everyone makes mistakes, there would be something wrong with
anyone.
Is Madam Sharon involved in a crime?
… No, that’s not narrow enough either. As a famous socialite tied to the
political sphere, it’s natural that she would be associated with something
dirty yet cannot be convicted for… Also, what is the deﬁnition of a crime
anyway? The laws of the Loen Kingdom, or the laws of the Intis Republic,
or is it up to me to decide?
…
Despite his many thoughts, Klein didn’t want to delay it any further.
After all, his physical body was still in the real world. Thus, he
decided to conﬁrm the past few divinations he did regarding the
incident.
He picked up the pen and, without writing, he conjured a divination
statement on the goatskin before him
“John Maynard’s death was due to supernatural inﬂuences.”
This was the divination he did when he went to Maynard’s house to
help the police. The answer he received last time was negative.
Grabbing the silver chain, he allowed the topaz pendulum to almost
touch the statement on the goatskin. Klein half-closed his eyes and
silently recited the divination statement, “John Maynard’s death was
due to supernatural inﬂuences.
“John Maynard’s death was due to supernatural inﬂuences.”
…
After repeating it seven times, he opened his eyes and looked at the
pendulum. His pupils constricted suddenly.
The topaz pendulum was spinning clockwise!
Clockwise meant a positive result!
Maynard’s death was really due to supernatural inﬂuences!
Klein stared at the pendulum that was slowing down, his heart
churning in turmoil.
My divination back then was inﬂuenced, disrupted…
Madam Sharon is a Beyonder, a rather powerful Beyonder? Or is there
someone backing her, having helped in planning Maynard’s death?
Did they want to remove a powerful opponent to the seat of mayor, to
remove a future House of Commons Member of Parliament from the New
Party?
Many thoughts raced through his mind as Klein wrote a new
divination statement: “Madam Sharon is a Beyonder.”
He recited the statement seven times, still using the pendulum
technique. Klein used the location he was at, as well as the
information he knew regarding Madam Sharon, to complete the
divination. He saw an answer.
The answer was the clockwise rotation of the topaz pendulum: the
answer was yes!
Madam Sharon is a Beyonder… Klein’s nerves tensed. He didn’t delay
any further, immediately answering his own prayer and pushing open
the mysterious door.
After a moment of chaos and dizziness, he saw Madam Sharon’s
bedroom and himself.
Klein ﬂoated to the front of the heavy safe and extended his right
hand. He carefully extended his hand into the safe.
Since Madam Sharon was a Beyonder, he had to be wary of traps in
the safe.
In such a state, where his soul was infused with powers of the
mysterious space and his spirituality, Klein no longer needed
divination. He would receive a warning when he was approaching
something dangerous—a large portion of divination was obtaining
revelations by allowing one’s Astral Projection to roam in the spirit
world. In other words, it was derived from one’s spirituality.
Klein didn’t notice anything unusual. when his nearly-transparent
hand made it through the thick metal door.
After sweeping his hand, he leaned forward, plunging his entire spirit
into the safe.
He saw that the inside of the safe was split into three sections. The
ﬁrst was ﬁlled with gold bars, thick stacks of cash, and even more
precious jewelry. Another layer had sealed documents. Klein blew on
them, but he didn’t manage to ﬂip them open to look at their
contents.
Yes, I’ll have to try again with Mr. Azik’s copper whistle… Klein had
experimented with it previously. When he enveloped the Flaring Sun
Charm or Azik’s copper whistle with his spirit, both the items were
able to make it through obstacles, as if becoming illusory items
themselves.
The bottom-most layer of the safe was rather strange. There was only
a black and white photo there. On the photo was a suave young man.
Madam Sharon’s past lover? Were they forcefully broken apart, and
Madam Sharon having no choice but to marry the old baron and, thus,
embarked on her path of debauchery by entering the beds of multiple
men? But deep in her heart, she still harbors a pure space. Every night,
when it’s quiet, she takes out this photo and strokes it with tears on her
face… Klein instantly imagined the plot of a great romantic tragedy.
But the more he looked at it, the more something seemed amiss. The
young man in the photo seemed, perhaps, a little too much like
Madam Sharon…
Madam Sharon’s brother? She’s a Beyonder… F**k, could she also be of
the Demoness pathway? The same as Instigator Trissy! Klein suddenly
had a stroke of inspiration which scared himself.
Could the reason Trissy stayed in Tingen this long be because her partner
was here? Klein observed the photo closely, realizing that the young
man looked remarkably like Madam Sharon.
His nearly-transparent face grimaced in pain. He could no longer
view that “porno” the same way as before!
Collecting himself, Klein felt for the corners of the safe to see if they
hid anything.
Even though he couldn’t pick up any papers in his current state,
passing through objects was a diﬀerent feeling from passing through
the air. The feeling was also diﬀerent when passing through objects
of diﬀerent densities.
In his search, Klein suddenly froze.
He found an empty space on the side of the safe facing the wall—a
hidden compartment!
After conﬁrming that there was no danger, Klein made his way
inside. What entered his ﬁeld of vision were ointments, fragrances,
powdered herbs, and other objects. The centerpiece was a statue of a
god that took the form of a skeleton.
The statue was about the size of a palm, and probably of a beautiful
girl. It had long hair all the way to its heels, each strand of hair was
thick and clear, like a venomous snake.
Situated at the tip of every strand of hair was an eye—some closed,
others open.
Klein was shocked. He caught a whiﬀ of an evil scent and hurried out
of the hidden compartment.
He now understood why his divination for any secret rooms or
partitions in the room had failed!
Chapter 196: Spirit Medium
Mirror
Klein rushed out of the heavy safe in retreat. Only when he realized
that everything seemed ﬁne did he calm down.
That white bone statue is creepy… Although it isn’t dangerous, it gives me
the creeps… Could it be the so-called Primordial Demoness? An evil god
like the Hidden Sage, the Dark Side of the Universe, or the True Creator?
Klein recalled his hunches about Madam Sharon, and he suddenly
understood what existence the white bone statue might represent.
Just as he thought, his spirituality stirred as an ominous premonition
gripped him.
Klein quickly ﬂew next to the window with complicated patterns and
looked at the road outside. He saw a carriage driving towards the
front gate under the light of the gas street lamps.
Madam Sharon is back? There was a tug at his heartstrings as he
ﬁnally understood the source of his ominous premonition.
Taking into consideration that Trissy only became a woman after
Sequence 8 Instigator, Madam Sharon was most likely a Sequence 7.
And since Madam Sharon has been active in Tingen’s social circles for
many years, she was most likely much stronger than Trissy. Klein
didn’t dare to take the risk of relying on his Flaring Sun Charm and
Azik’s copper whistle. Instead, he made the wise decision to leave.
He had a limited number of charms. Plus, he didn’t know when he
would be able to get the Sealed Artifact, Mutated Sun Sacred
Emblem, out again. Hence, if it wasn’t a desperate situation, Klein
didn’t want to waste his most powerful charms. He would also have
the issue of explaining himself if he were to use it.
I can’t just tell Dunn that a kind expert had happened to pass by and
helped me, right?
As for why he didn’t want to use Azik’s copper whistle, it was
because Klein wasn’t sure if the messenger, that was summoned, had
the ability to ﬁght. What if it just looked strong but only knew how
to send letters?
With what I discovered earlier, it should be suﬃcient for the Nighthawks
Squad to take action. Why should I ﬁght against Madam Sharon alone?
We can totally gank her! Klein emphasized inwardly and ended his
summoning. With a whoosh, he returned to the world above the gray
fog. He then quickly wrapped himself in spirituality and stimulated a
rapid descent to return to his body in reality.
He quickly put out the ﬂame and put away the candle. He removed
the wall of spirituality and left Madam Sharon’s bedroom. He took
the same path back, but he didn’t have the time to reset the bolt on
the balcony door.
Sliding down the water pipe, Klein climbed over the wall which was
opposite the entrance of the house. He remained hidden until he
reached the neighboring street. Then, he hired the expensive night
carriage to Zouteland Street.
…
Madam Sharon, who looked beautiful in her black dress, slowly
walked to the second ﬂoor. She dismissed her maidservants and
opened the door to her bedroom.
Her pure clear eyes suddenly concentrated and reﬂected ﬁne threads
that were almost transparent and unnoticeable. They didn’t possess
the luster of spirituality; they were like human hair that was
pathologically changed. If one didn’t already know of their existence
or have a pair of very special eyes, they wouldn’t notice the strands.
All those ﬁne threads had torn and fallen to the ground.
Madam Sharon squinted her eyes and directed her focus onto the
thick gray metal safe.
…
36 Zouteland Street, the Blackthorn Security Company.
Dunn was reading the newspaper casually with his legs crossed. He
looked at Klein who appeared before his oﬃce door with a strange
expression. He sighed and said, “Weren’t you supposed to slip into
Madam Sharon’s house to do an initial search? … Did you encounter
some sort of problem?”
Klein nodded seriously and said, “Yes, I suspect that Madam Sharon
is a member of the Demoness Sect.”
“A member of the Demoness Sect?” Dunn lowered the newspaper and
ruminated over the words. He then asked seriously, “What did you
discover?”
Klein didn’t sit down, he leaned his body forward and supported his
weight with his hands holding the edge of the work desk.
“First, I found a photo. There was a young man in the photo, but he
looked very much like Madam Sharon.”
If he were to change into female clothing, put on makeup, and Photoshop
the picture a little, he would look exactly like Madam Sharon… Klein
held back his urge to lampoon.
“Similar to Instigator Trissy?” Dunn’s eyes sparkled as he was
enlightened.
They had previously predicted that Trissy was most likely a member
of the Demoness Sect.
“Yes.” Klein nodded with mixed emotions as he continued, “I used
divination to discover that Madam Sharon has a white bone statue in
a hidden compartment in her safe. It’s of an extremely beautiful
woman, but her hair is very long, to her ankles. Every single strand is
as thick as a venomous snake. On the tips, there were eyes. They
looked rather creepy. Captain, is that the image of the Primordial
Demoness?”
As his security clearance was insuﬃcient, the information about the
Demoness Sect that he could read was very limited.
Dunn recalled and nodded with a serious expression and said, “That’s
the image of the Primordial Demoness.
We have to take action immediately and seize control of Madam
Sharon.”
Klein immediately agreed and said, “If Madam Sharon is a Mid-
Sequence Beyonder from the Demoness Sect, I have to assume that
she’ll be able to tell that someone had sneaked into her bedroom.”
Then, he suddenly felt puzzled as he blurted, “Captain, why do the
seven orthodox gods only have symbols without any actual image,
while the evil gods that I’m currently aware of have anthropomorphic
appearances? The True Creator and the Primordial Demoness are
examples. Is this one of the diﬀerences between orthodox gods and
evil gods?”
Why would there be such a diﬀerence? Klein added inwardly, but he
wisely didn’t say it out.
“That’s one of the diﬀerences between orthodox gods and evil gods.”
Dunn gave a reassuring answer. Then, he got up and walked towards
the clothes rack. He said, “Let’s not delay any further, I’m worried
that Madam Sharon will run away.”
Then, Dunn paused.
“Go upstairs to get Kenley. With the three of us taking action
together, we can apply for one Sealed Artifact. Madam Sharon is very
likely higher than a Sequence 7 Beyonder.”
Captain, you’re so wise! Klein answered without hesitation, “Alright.”
Then, he asked curiously, “Captain, which Sealed Artifact are you
going to use?”
Dunn weighed his words before he answered, “3-0217.”
As there weren’t many Sealed Artifacts behind Tingen City’s Chanis
Gate, Klein quickly remembered what Captain wanted to use.
“Number: 0217.
“Name: Spirit Medium’s Mirror.
“Danger Grade: 3. Considerably dangerous. It has to be used
carefully. It can only be requested for operations that require three or
more people.
“Security classiﬁcation: Oﬃcial Nighthawk member or above.
“Sealed Method: Store in absolute darkness.
“Description: The back of the mirror is plated in mercury, the front of
the mirror has three minor cracks.
“The very ﬁrst investigator that looked into the mirror saw a sobbing
girl with long hair. Then, he discovered the girl climbing out of the
mirror.
“From many experiments with the artifact, the image that’s reﬂected
in the mirror is diﬀerent most of the time. Even if the same person
uses it repeatedly, they would encounter diﬀerent things of varying
danger levels. But they would prioritize dealing with the person who
looked at the mirror ﬁrst.
“The most dangerous situation is to see oneself in the mirror.
“If no one looks at the mirror, under the prerequisite of there being
light, an image would surface automatically every three hours.
“It doesn’t possess any living traits.
“Remark: The mirror originally belonged to a Spirit Medium and was
a very ordinary mirror until one day the Spirit Medium committed
suicide when looking into it.”
Indeed, that there aren’t many Sealed Artifacts behind Chanis Gate that
can be used in a Beyonder battle. 3-0217 is a good choice… Klein didn’t
speak further as he immediately ran to the Nighthawks’ recreation
room to get Sleepless Kenley.
That night was Royale’s turn to be on duty at Chanis Gate. Leonard
was oﬀ duty, Seeka Tron was patrolling areas like Raphael Cemetery,
and the new member would only arrive on Sunday. Hence, Dunn
could only pick from Frye and Kenley. Taking into consideration that
Madam Sharon was from the Demoness Sect and had little to do with
dead spirits, he had opted for the latter.
After a few minutes, Dunn returned from the basement. He held the
mirror that was tightly wrapped in a thick black cloth.
Frankly speaking, if I didn’t know beforehand, I wouldn’t be able to tell
that it’s a mirror. None of it is exposed… Klein went forward with the
petite-sized Kenley.
“You’re in charge of using Sealed Artifact 3-0217.” Dunn passed the
mirror to Kenley.
Upon seeing that, Klein suddenly realized that he was a Sequence 8
Beyonder and that he possessed the ability to ﬁght head on. He
couldn’t just hide by the side as support.
Man, I’m a little nervous… He touched the Slumber Charms in his
pockets and made sure that he was well prepared.
The only problem is that in order to make it easier to climb, I’m not
bringing my cane. Hmm, I can borrow Kenley’s. He has the mirror in one
hand and a gun in the other; that should be suﬃcient. Amidst Klein’s
thoughts, the trio arrived downstairs and took a carriage to Osna
Street.
On their way there, Kenley looked at the Sealed Artifact 3-0217 in his
hands. He sighed from the tension.
“This is the ﬁrst time I’ve been involved in such a dangerous
operation.”
Normally, the Nighthawks wouldn’t use any Sealed Artifacts to deal
with Beyonder incidents.
When they went to Morse Town, they had applied for the Mutated
Sun Sacred Emblem for preventive purposes. Given how far away
Morse Town was, it would’ve taken backup some time to arrive if
they needed it. This time, they were almost certain that their target
was a Mid-Sequence Beyonder!
“Don’t worry, perhaps Madam Sharon has already ﬂed,” Klein replied
with a smile.
Honestly, he was just as tense as Kenley.
Dunn’s eyes turned and looked at him helplessly.
“Let’s try not to let Madam Sharon escape.”
…
About twenty minutes later, the three Nighthawks arrived at Osna
Street. They saw the garden and Madam Sharon’s house in the
darkness. The house lay in silence as though nothing had happened.
Klein took out the pendulum in his left sleeve and made a quick
divination.
“There’s danger inside.
“There’s danger inside.”
…
After he recited the statement seven times, he opened his eyes and
saw the topaz pendant spinning clockwise. The amplitude and speed
were considered medium-level.
It meant that there was danger in there. Not very high, but it wasn’t
very low either!
Chapter 197: Operation
There’s danger in there. Not very high, but it isn’t very low either…
This means that Madam Sharon is still in the building. She hasn’t ﬂed
yet…
Klein froze for a moment, quickly realizing the reason.
He had entered a unique state by summoning himself to inspect the
safe. He hadn’t forcefully broken the lock when he was inspecting the
secret compartment, nor did he activate any hidden traps. Thus,
Madam Sharon wouldn’t have discovered that her secret had been
exposed. She would only think that there was a break in, or some
private investigator was checking on her to no avail.
In such a situation, it was logical that she would continue to stay
home. It made logical sense.
To lose composure from a tiny matter and overreact wasn’t the
Madam Sharon whom Klein had come to understand. She was a calm
socialite who was capable of acting afraid and pitiful, as well as a
Beyonder member of the Demoness Sect who had kept her identity
hidden for many years.
If the telephone had been invented, Madam Sharon deﬁnitely would’ve
called one of her lovers and complained about the security in Tingen City
whilst hinting that it was Madam Maynard… Klein began imagining a
melodramatic plot. He told Dunn and Kenley the results of his
divination as well as his guess.
“That’s the most reasonable deduction.” Dunn pressed down on his
hat as he looked at the second ﬂoor of Madam Sharon’s apartment.
“There’s no need for us to rush in.”
“Why?” Kenley, who was holding Sealed Artifact 3-0217,
instinctively asked.
He was ﬁlled with fear towards the Spirit Medium Mirror in his
hands. He was afraid that some unexpected event would arise from
the Sealed Artifact.
Dunn wore his black gloves and looked at Klein.
“Do you still remember what happened when we tried to capture
Instigator Trissy?”
“I remember,” Klein replied after some thought. “She seemed to be
able to detect our presence and make the necessary responses, which
resulted in her successful escape.”
I also remember suggesting the use of bombarding the house when the
Captain asked me how I would deal with the situation. That was the
safest, most sureﬁre method. But not this time… We can’t use it here as
there are many innocent maids in Madam Sharon’s house. If we notiﬁed
them in advance and got them to evacuate, that would deﬁnitely catch
Madam Sharon’s attention. According to Leonard, Trissy could turn
invisible. We have to assume that Madam Sharon has that ability too…
Klein connected the dots at once.
Dunn looked at the crimson moon in the sky and said, “Good, your
answer is very good. You’re rather intuitive in such situations.
“We cannot approach recklessly and end up alarming Madam Sharon.
I’ll try dragging her into a dream from a distance. If I’m successful,
you and Kenley will go and capture her… Well… You can make the
decision of whether to kill her or not. Kill her if you cannot control
her. Your safety is of utmost importance.”
Captain, your line of thought is always so clear at such critical moments! I
was just waiting for you to say that! Klein praised in his heart.
Over the months, Klein had grasped most of the unique traits of the
diﬀerent Beyonder powers of his partners when he was casually
chatting with Dunn, Leonard, Frye, and the rest. Amongst those,
Dunn Smith, who was a Nightmare, could freely enter the dreams of
a sleeping person even though he was at home or at the Blackthorn
Security Company.
But how he did it was a secret of his own Sequence, and Klein didn’t
ask about it too deeply.
The ability to drag someone into a dream had a limited range and
was normally used during direct confrontations.
But Klein had once heard the Captain say that the ability also had a
certain eﬀect when used within a hundred meter radius. But he
needed time to complete the process. He couldn’t do it instantly, for
the process was similar to coaxing a child to sleep.
At this moment, Dunn was going to drag the distant Madam Sharon
into a sleeping state, a little at a time. After completing the ﬁrst
stages of the restraint, he was going to create the most opportunistic
conditions for Klein and Kenley.
“Alright.” Kenley was also rather accepting of the Captain’s plan.
Without any more chatter, Dunn leaned on the corner of a wall and
shut his eyes. He put his hands together and lowered his head. His
black windbreaker and silk hat blended into the night.
…
In the opulent bedroom.
Madam Sharon was leaning on her comfortable rocking chair,
completely naked. Her fair and excellent ﬁgure was completely
exposed.
She sometimes turned her head towards the full-length mirror to
admire her charming self.
As she looked, her face would ﬂush red as tears welled in her eyes.
Her expression emitted a strange tenderness amidst her stupor.
The skeletal statue of the goddess was sitting on the table beside her.
The thick strands of hair seemed gentle under the warm, pink light.
Slowly, the frequency in which Madam Sharon looked into the mirror
decreased. Bit by bit, her eyelids couldn’t help but droop.
…
Seconds turned into minutes when Klein suddenly recalled
something. How was the Captain going to notify Kenley and himself after
he successfully dragged Madam Sharon into a dream?
Madam Sharon would wake up if the Captain left his Nightmare state,
and she would notice that something was oﬀ… I wonder if the Captain is
capable of giving hand signs while dreaming at the same time? Klein
looked at the worried Kenley pacing around and intended to discuss
this with him in order to distract him.
At that moment, his mind turned into a blur. He saw a giant crimson
moon, as well as Captain Dunn Smith in his black windbreaker under
the moon. There was also the short Kenley, his expression dazed.
Klein realized that he too was dreaming!
I’ve been dragged into a dream by the Captain… So that’s how he was
going to notify us. He wanted to facepalm himself, but could only
maintain his trance-like state while saying muddle-headedly,
“Captain?”
Dunn nodded slightly and said, “Madam Sharon has entered a dream.
You can take action now.”
He then emphasized, “Remember to be careful, and don’t be too
reckless… We would rather miss the opportunity than take
unwarranted risks.”
Just as he ﬁnished his sentence, the world before Klein shattered. His
eyes reﬂected Dunn Smith again. He was still at the corner of the
wall, looking down with his hands clenched tightly into ﬁsts.
On the other side, Kenley, who had stopped pacing about, also
opened his eyes.
The duo exchanged looks and nodded. Both of them entered a state
to execute their operation.
Even though this was the ﬁrst time Kenley was participating in a
relatively dangerous mission, he was still more experienced than
Klein. He had attended many oﬃcial missions, so he quickly adjusted
his mental state, becoming calm and sharp.
Of course, this could also be attributed to the augmentation the night
had on a Sleepless. This was also one of the reasons Dunn had chosen
Kenley over Frye for this operation.
“Let’s go.” As a Sequence 8, Klein took on the role of the leader,
signaling for his partner to follow.
Kenley didn’t object. He gripped the tightly-wrapped mirror and
softened his footsteps as he followed.
Klein led him to the place where he scaled the wall previously. He
grabbed onto the crevices of the wall and made it to the top of the
wall with little eﬀort.
He maintained his ridiculous sense of balance and turned around,
bending down and grabbing the Spirit Medium Mirror Kenley had
tossed over.
The moment he touched the mirror, Klein felt his spiritual perception
tighten suddenly. It was as if what was covered by the black cloth
wasn’t a mirror, but a door to some unknown, dangerous alternate
world.
Indeed, any item that requires sealing has some maleﬁc side to it… Klein
internally muttered to himself wistfully as he watched Kenley scale
the wall.
In order to facilitate movement, Kenley had placed his cane beside
Dunn. Klein didn’t dwell on that matter.
After making their way through the garden to the side of the
building, he climbed the pipe up to the balcony of the second ﬂoor,
just as he did before.
He then hung naturally from his feet, allowing his body to fall, once
again taking Sealed Artifact 3-0271.
Kenley looked at him, puzzled. But immediately, he nodded his head
in enlightenment.
At that moment, Klein was shocked by his own actions. He exerted a
force using his waist, and, with the support of his left hand, he easily
ﬂipped over.
What happened just now? Why did I move like that? It felt so natural… Is
that an ability of the Clown? He thought back and felt that he was able
to better display the unique characteristics of a Clown in actual
practice.
After waiting for Kenley to easily make his way up, Klein handed the
Spirit Medium Mirror back to him before pulling open the unlocked
door of the balcony.
Kenley carefully pulled away the black cloth wrapped around Sealed
Artifact 3-0271. He pointed the object mirror side down, reﬂecting
the tiles on the ground.
One of the rules of the Spirit Medium Mirror was not to use it on
yourself or your partners!
After putting away the black cloth, Kenley took out his revolver and
followed behind Klein. They made their way past the corridor
towards Madam Sharon’s bedroom, their footsteps light.
Klein wielded his readied revolver, and, while activating his Spirit
Vision, he reached out for the door handle with his left hand.
He didn’t dare to be careless since his divination told him that there
would be danger present.
The reason why he didn’t make another quick divination was that he
knew the presence of the Primordial Demoness’s statue in the room.
At this distance, his divination would deﬁnitely be interrupted. He
knew that there was no way for him to get a clear answer without
relying on the gray fog’s obstruction. Furthermore, with Kenley
beside him, there was no way for him to enter that mysterious space.
After pushing open the door, what entered Klein and Kenley’s ﬁeld of
vision was the warm light from the gas lamp.
Then, they saw Madam Sharon slumped over her chair, as well as her
alluring body.
However, Madam Sharon wasn’t asleep. She was reclined in her chair
with a faint smile across her mouth, looking straight at her two
visitors.
Instinctively, Kenley ﬂipped his palm and pointed the Spirit Medium
Mirror at Madam Sharon.
Klein ﬁrst froze, then exclaimed, “No!”
He clearly remembered that there was a full-length mirror on the
other side of the chair. But it wasn’t there now!
The Spirit Medium Mirror had locked onto Madam Sharon in just a
second.
But that image of Madam Sharon became blurry before turning into a
full-length mirror.
Kenley looked at himself in the mirror and also Sealed Artifact
3-0271 reﬂecting his own image.
A ﬁgure instantly appeared within the Spirit Medium Mirror. It was
an expressionless, sinister image of Kenley himself!
Klein felt his limbs turn rigid as if he had been entangled by invisible
threads.
An elegant ﬁgure appeared beside the full-length mirror. It was
Madam Sharon, wearing a nightgown.
She glanced at the two intruders and chuckled.
“If it wasn’t for the fact that the statue happened to be beside me, I
should be deep asleep now, waiting for you to wake me up with a
kiss.”
At that moment, Klein suddenly shouted a simple term in ancient
Hermes, “Crimson!”
He had no idea when he dug his left palm into his pocket. He deftly
ﬂicked his ﬁngers and tossed out a Slumber Charm.
Chapter 198: Appropriating
Uniqueness
The silver charm suddenly turned ice-cold, just like a crystal coat
with layers of frost.
Klein shivered and suddenly became more alert, his fear and
agitation temporarily froze.
He quickly injected his spirituality into the charm and pushed the
thin silver piece out of his pocket with his ﬁngertip, causing it to
drop to his feet.
A crimson ﬂame appeared in the air, and the sound of light,
continuous explosions echoed in the room.
A serene and deep feeling instantly emanated and engulfed most of
the bedroom, including Madam Sharon, Sleepless Kenley, and also
Klein himself!
The Slumber Charm was an item that didn’t distinguish between the
enemy and the caster. In most situations, using it meant throwing it
at the enemy.
That way, the caster would only be aﬀected by the remnant shock
waves, but not to the extent of failing to resist the temptation of
falling into a deep sleep.
But Klein’s arms were entangled by countless invisible threads. He
couldn’t throw the charm, so he could only exchange Madam
Sharon’s slumber with his!
But he had long considered such a situation and was prepared. This
was because his body was unique—a uniqueness that was unlike most
Low-Sequence Beyonders.
In that instant, Klein’s eyelids closed and entered into deep sleep
normally, while Madam Sharon and Kenley also appeared to slow
down.
Klein quickly realized that he was in a dream and rationally knew
that he was sleeping.
Whenever anything related to dream invasions or similar hypnotic
eﬀects were used on him, he could still maintain consciousness!
He had discovered this when he was dealing with Dunn’s Nightmare
powers, as well as when Daly was channeling his spirit!
Kacha!
Klein tore out of the dream forcefully and woke up. He felt the
countless threads binding his arms, legs, and body loosen. As for
Madam Sharon, she had a vacant look, as though she was going to
shake oﬀ the eﬀect of the Slumber Charm but had yet to wake up
entirely. Kenley was on the ground with the Spirit Medium Mirror
ﬂipped upside down nearby, while his revolver had been ﬂung to the
door.
An opportunity!
Klein seized the moment while the ﬁne threads loosened, he took out
his left hand and snapped his ﬁngers. He lit up a faint blue spiritual
ﬂame and burned the countless ﬁne threads before him.
At the same time, he picked up his revolver with his right hand and
pulled the trigger repeatedly.
Bang! Bang!
The two silver demon hunting bullets tore through the barrel and
ﬁred towards Madam Sharon.
Klein didn’t conﬁrm the outcome but bent his knees, exerted strength
in his waist, and leaped over to Kenley. Simultaneously, he broke the
ﬁne strings that were tied around his body.
His earlier shots were mainly to inform the Captain that something
unexpected had happened inside. They were already ﬁghting and
were in need of assistance. Of course, if he could shoot Madam
Sharon directly, that’d be the best outcome!
However, Klein didn’t believe a Sequence 7 or 6 Beyonder could be
taken care of so easily.
There were faint blue ﬂames twirling in the air, dancing across the
ﬁnes threads in the room. In such a dreamy scenery, the two silver
demon hunting bullets struck Madam Sharon’s body.
Kacha! Kacha!
Madam Sharon was in her translucent sleeping robe, and her
indistinct body shattered like the crimson moon’s reﬂection in a lake.
The full body mirror next to her cracked into pieces, and most of
them shattered into about thumbnail-sized chunks while a small
amount remained on the frame. They all resembled palms, strangely-
shaped palms.
A substitute? A Beyonder power of the Demoness Sequence? The corner
of Klein’s eyes swept over it as he already rolled next to Kenley. Since
the ﬁne strings were all broken by his movement, the faint blue
ﬂames didn’t spread over.
At that moment, Madam Sharon had vanished, but the “sleeping”
Kenley lifted his hands and gripped his neck so tightly that his saliva
began ﬂowing out as his tongue protruded. But he didn’t seem like he
was going to stop.
But in Klein’s Spirit Vision, there weren’t any abnormal things
around!
He suddenly recalled the description of Sealed Artifact 3-0271.
The most dangerous situation is when you see yourself!
Could it be that Kenley saw his own reﬂection in Sealed Artifact 3-0271
through the full body mirror? Klein speculated. He quickly took out
another silver charm without having the luxury of time to think
about it.
It was a triangular-shaped item: a Requiem Charm.
“Crimson!”
Klein said the ancient Hermes word while he instilled his spirituality
into the charm and threw it out.
Then, he pressed down his left hand and grabbed the Spirit Medium
Mirror.
He used the corner of his eye to determine that the Sealed Artifact
was facing downward so it wouldn’t reﬂect himself.
The triangular silver charm ignited into icy-blue ﬂames. The gentle
and serene darkness blanketed Kenley and aﬀected Klein himself.
The nervous emotions dispersed in that instant. Kenley relaxed his
hands on his throat, while Klein felt like he was standing before his
oriel window at home, overlooking the quiet streets. His physical and
mental state was at peace.
That was exactly what Klein wanted!
At that very moment, he entered an extremely serene state. He
appeared to be the only person left in the entire world with nothing
else in existence.
Within this sense of calmness, he suddenly had a gut feeling in his
mind.
Madam Sharon is about to attack my right waist!
That was the foresight ability of a Clown in battle. Without any
hesitation, Klein lifted the Spirit Medium Mirror and rolled to his left.
Just as he moved, a dagger, burning in dark ﬂames, pierced the spot
where he had stood earlier.
Madam Sharon’s ﬁgure was outlined once again.
As he rolled, Klein suddenly lifted the Spirit Medium Mirror and
pointed it at Madam Sharon!
Besides saving his teammate, his main goal when he got close to
Kenley was to pick up the Sealed Artifact.
Otherwise, he didn’t believe that anything good would come out of
waiting for the Captain’s reinforcements while being next to Madam
Sharon. The Flaring Sun Charm could be used to ﬁght against a
Beyonder, but the eﬀect wouldn’t be as signiﬁcant as if it was used
against a dead spirit. Plus, the other person wouldn’t just stand there
and wait for him to use a charm.
If it really didn’t work, Klein could only take the risk and use Azik’s
copper whistle.
Regarding how he would explain it, he would think about it after he
managed to stay alive!
However, things developed better than Klein had predicted. Madam
Sharon opted for assassination. She didn’t interrupt his use of the
Requiem Charm and the Spirit Medium Mirror.
Therefore, Klein had instantly formulated a simple plan. He didn’t
avoid the repercussions of the Requiem Charm but relied on it to
enhance his foresight ability as a Clown. Then, he seized the
opportunity to dodge the attack while he used the Spirit Medium
Mirror to reﬂect the enemy!
When Madam Sharon missed her strike, she immediately wanted to
chase after her agile opponent who was rolling away. She suddenly
saw a mirror with three cracks.
The surface of the mirror rippled, and a woman’s ﬁgure appeared.
Her hair was black and thick, hanging low and blocking her face.
Klein’s left hand shook, and the Spirit Medium Mirror glided on the
carpet for a dozen centimeters with the front facing upwards.
A pale hand extended out of the mirror, and a woman in a white
bedsheet-like dress climbed out of the mirror quickly and pounced at
Madam Sharon.
Madam Sharon’s expression became gloomy, there was a layer of
darkness above her innocent brown eyes.
Her surroundings ignited with seven black ﬂames.
With a swoosh, a black ﬂame ﬂew out and hit the woman in the
white dress.
Whoosh!
The woman caught on ﬁre and wailed in pain. Very soon, she
vanished into thin air.
Sou! Sou! Sou!
The black ﬂames ﬂew at Klein one after another like bullets.
Klein’s pupils constricted as he quickly rolled away. He didn’t dare
stay in that spot.
However, his action of rolling gradually became slower because there
seemed to be ﬁne threads entangling him again. They slowed him
down and aﬀected his motion.
It seemed like the nemesis of the Clown’s combat abilities!
The black ﬂames ﬂew past Klein’s face and fell onto Madam Sharon’s
bed. However, it didn’t burn, seemingly eﬀective on items with life or
spirituality.
Klein had yet to feel rejoice over his successful dodge when another
premonition ﬂashed through his head.
He twisted his spine and changed his forward ﬂip into a side roll.
A transparent ice crystal suddenly appeared like a spear and stabbed
into the carpet where Klein had originally intended to land.
The white frost expanded and struck Klein whose actions were
aﬀected by the ﬁne threads.
He suddenly shivered, and his body became stiﬀ. Although he could
still move, he was much slower.
Madam Sharon had black ﬂames surrounding her again, and there
was a transparent ice spear that condensed in her hands. Klein didn’t
hesitate any further as he shoved his hand into his pocket and
grabbed Azik’s copper whistle.
He, he, he.
Just then, Kenley shook oﬀ the eﬀect of the Requiem and Slumber
charms. He got up and looked towards Madam Sharon with a pair of
vacant-looking eyes.
His face seemed to be blanketed by a shadow, making him look silent
yet creepy.
Thud. Thud. Thud. Kenley leaped at Madam Sharon who was the
closest.
Madam Sharon narrowed her eyes and shot the black ﬂames
surrounding her one after another at Kenley.
Poof! Poof Poof! The black ﬂames disappeared like snowﬂakes and
didn’t have any eﬀect.
Klein was stunned at ﬁrst, then he lifted the gun in his right hand and
pulled the trigger while aiming at Madam Sharon.
Bang!
Madam Sharon dodged ahead of time and threw the frost spear
towards Kenley, but it only penetrated his clothes and not his skin.
Hence, it didn’t create a freezing eﬀect.
Bang! Klein ﬁred again, and Madam Sharon dodged to the side of the
broken full-body mirror and picked up a palm-sized fragment.
She continued to walk swiftly and dodged another bullet. She then
used the irregular fragment to reﬂect Kenley as he leaped over at her.
Right on the heels of that, Madam Sharon dodged to the side as she
swiped the mirror with her palm which was covered in black ﬂames.
At that moment, Klein had emptied his revolver. He had no choice
but to throw it, letting the empty shells and revolver fall to the
carpet.
Just as he rolled over to pick up Kenley’s revolver, he heard his
teammate’s tragic scream.
Kenley stopped before bending over and vomiting. It was bile at ﬁrst,
then a red heart, followed by his lungs and stomach that were
burning with black ﬂames.
Chapter 199: Successful Toss of
the Die
The beating heart, the yellowish-green liquid, the silently burning
black ﬂames, and the falling ﬁgure entered Klein’s ﬁeld of vision and
etched themselves deeply into Klein’s mind.
The most dangerous mission he had encountered up to this date had
been when he was dealing with Ray Bieber who was in the midst of
digesting. Even such a terrifying and dangerous monster had only
resulted in severe injuries to the Beyonders on the mission. No one
had to sacriﬁce their lives.
The deaths of the Beyonders Klein had witnessed, including Old
Neil’s, were all due to them losing control. The “murderer” might be
strange and indescribable or related to evil gods, but they had
nothing to do with the missions they undertook.
Now, he was looking at one of his partners being killed in action. The
death was purely due to one mistake.
Nighthawks were ﬁghting against madness, but so were they also
ﬁghting against danger.
There might never be an opportunity to make up for that one
mistake.
Klein’s thoughts erupted with a boom.
Apparently having taken a huge blow, he knelt down and lifted his
right hand, ﬁring successive shots at Madam Sharon. The silver
demon hunting bullets pierced through the invisible threads and shot
towards her head and transparent sleeping gown.
Suddenly, Madam Sharon appeared to be yanked in another direction
by something, allowing her to successfully avoid Klein’s manic
shooting.
Klein only managed to collect himself and regain the ability of
rational thought when he ﬁnished ﬁring the ﬁve bullets in his
revolver, and the sound of the hammer striking an empty chamber
entered his ears.
His heart tightened. Without any time to reload, he tossed the
revolver to the side and took out a stack of tarot cards!
Pa!
Madam Sharon’s body moved to the side and saw a card ﬂy past her,
piercing deeply into the surface of the makeup table.
She smiled, her beautiful brown eyes once again taking on a black
luster.
At that moment, her waterfall like brown hair suddenly ﬂailed into
the air like it was lifted by an invisible force.
Madam Sharon froze. She wanted to dodge, but she was too slow.
Klein had tossed out a “Magician” card, successfully pinning her hair
to the wall.
Pa! Madam Sharon forcefully tore away her hair and rolled forward,
her body quickly vanishing from Klein’s line of sight.
She’s turned invisible again… Klein had a tarot card between his
ﬁngers as he slowly turned around while being alert of his
surroundings.
Suddenly, he realized why Madam Sharon had to give up her attack,
and why she had slowed down.
If the situation had developed normally, Klein would have had no
choice but to use Azik’s copper whistle to deal with this terrifying
demoness!
Yes! The Captain must be around here somewhere! He felt a little
excited. He looked around, his gaze instinctively falling on the
window.
At the same time, he made a judgment in his heart.
Madam Sharon wants to ﬂee!
She knew that we still have a partner with the ability to drag her into
a dream, but she was unsure if there would be other reinforcements
from the Nighthawks, Mandated Punishers, or Machinery Hivemind!
Even though she’s powerful, there’s no way that she can wipe out a
team of Beyonders on her own!
With that thought, Klein ﬂicked his wrist, tossing the tarot card
towards the window.
Whoosh Whoosh Whoosh! He threw out ﬁve cards in succession, three
sealing the window and the other two towards the door.
Crack! Thud! Thud!
Amidst the sound of shattering glass, two tarot cards dug into the ajar
bedroom door, one after the other. As he expected, Klein heard the
sound of dodging.
He once again tossed cards out, making use of his Clown’s intuition
to pinpoint where he should be aiming.
The cards pierced through the air and rapidly advanced before
drilling themselves into the sturdy wall. However, a ﬁgure was
quickly outlined in the air. It was none other than the brown-haired
Madam Sharon who was in a translucent sleeping gown.
The moment Madam Sharon was exposed, her eyes lost their focus, as
though she was falling asleep standing.
Captain… Klein scanned his surroundings but was in no hurry to
throw his cards. This was because he knew that Madam Sharon
would quickly break out of the dream. He had to deal fatal damage in
these two or three seconds, or their opponent would escape.
It was easy to escape from a Nightmare when there was a huge
distance between them!
Bending his knees, Klein rolled forward diagonally. He went prone
and extended his right hand, grabbing the edge of the Spirit Medium
Mirror that was facing upward.
He then ﬂicked his wrist before his reﬂection could appear in the
mirror. He tossed Sealed Artifact 3-0271 towards Madam Sharon,
mirror side facing her.
Madam Sharon’s body trembled. The color of her brown eyes was
quickly restored as they once again found their focus.
And awakening before her was a crystalline layer of sturdy frost that
appeared on the surface of her body.
However, she didn’t see the card, nor the demon hunting bullet
approaching her. All she saw was a mirror, and that the mirror was
reﬂecting her innocent, yet alluring beauty.
That beautiful face in the mirror suddenly became contorted.
Wrinkles, gashes of blood, and rotting spots appeared on her face.
“No!” Madam Sharon let out a shrill cry as if she had just witnessed
someone she loved die.
Her skin quickly took on a green color as yellow pus ﬂowed out the
corner of her eyes.
After a moment of suﬀering, a silent black ﬂame burned outward
from within Madam Sharon, as if she was trying to expel something.
The black ﬂames then condensed into a thick frost, as if it was
creating a coﬃn for an eternal rest.
The invisible threads ﬁnally took on a color that was visible to the
human eye. They enveloped the frost, forming a gigantic cocoon.
Thud. Thud. Thud. Sealed Artifact 3-0271 fell onto the ground and
tumbled before stopping beside Madam Sharon’s giant cocoon.
At that moment, Dunn broke through the window frame and
somersaulted into the room.
He caught sight of Kenley, who had stopped breathing, and his
expression sank.
It was at this moment, the cocoon cracked open. The coﬃn of ice
crumbled an inch at a time as black ﬂames turned into specks of
light, dissipating into the surroundings.
Madam Sharon’s skin had regained its normal color. Her eyes showed
fatigue, but she seemed normal.
Her eyes reﬂected Klein who was still sprawled on the ground. She
also saw Dunn Smith, his ﬁnger pressed on his glabella with his eyes
closed.
A formless ripple spread outward from Dunn as Madam Sharon’s
eyelids drooped uncontrollably. Under Dunn’s windbreaker were
writhing, snake-like objects.
Klein knew that the Captain couldn’t restrain Madam Sharon for long,
just like when they were previously ﬁghting Monster Bieber. Klein
rolled forward again, grabbed his revolver, the one he had previously
tossed onto the carpet.
He grabbed three demon hunting bullets with his left hand and
familiarity stuﬀed them into the round chambers.
Pa!
Klein closed the cylinder and stood up, taking aim at Madam Sharon
with both hands on the gun. He aimed at the center of her forehead.
Bang!
He controlled his body with the abilities of the Clown and pulled the
trigger.
The silver demon hunting bullet pierced through the air, accurately
hitting the ﬁxed target.
A bloody gash appeared between Madam Sharon’s eyes, but the
bullet seemed to tear through multiple layers of obstruction, causing
it to lose the bulk of its power, rendering it unable to pierce through
the target’s skull.
Klein ﬁred another two shots without hesitation when he saw Madam
Sharon suddenly open her eyes.
Bang! Bang!
A rain of blood splattered amidst white dots. The stunning beauty
that was Madam Sharon had become a mutilated corpse that would
incite nightmares in every man.
She had long run out of “substitutes” to use.
Phew. Phew . Klein lowered his arms and panted heavily. Madam
Sharon, with only half her head left, slumped onto the ground. She
still had an exceptional ﬁgure, her skin still white and tender.
Dunn straightened himself up and opened his eyes. He, too, lowered
his hand from his glabella, his face a little pale. He wasn’t injured,
but he looked as though he had lost a lot of blood.
“If it wasn’t for the fact that she wanted to kill a few people before
she tried to escape; if it wasn’t for Sealed Artifact 3-0271 reﬂecting
herself by chance, we probably would’ve only been able to injure
her…” Dunn slowly walked forward to Klein’s side, his voice
unusually low.
If it wasn’t for how unique I was, I would’ve died along with Kenley in the
ﬁrst ten seconds of the battle… Klein turned to look at Kenley who was
silently lying on the black ash. He exhaled.
“Captain, Kenley…”
“I know…” Dunn replied with a raspy voice. “I made a mistake. I was
fooled by Madam Sharon. I didn’t expect her to secretly escape from
the dream.”
He paused, then he said in a serious tone, “But you have to get used
to this. It’s normal for Nighthawks to die during missions. Perhaps
the next one to die would be me.”
Klein fell silent, not knowing how to reply. Kenley still had his eyes
open, staring blankly at the ceiling.
“May the Goddess bless you. May you ﬁnd true peace.” Dunn walked
over to Kenley’s side and drew a crimson moon on his chest.
He then squatted and closed his partner’s eyes.
May the Goddess bless you. May the serene night no longer harbor any
danger or madness… Klein also drew the crimson moon as he prayed
silently in his heart.
A few seconds later, he forcefully retracted his gaze and asked in a
heavy voice, “Captain, should I channel her spirit now?”
Dunn nodded indiscernibly.
“Don’t attempt to ask about the Primordial Demoness. That’s very
dangerous. I’ll guard you and prevent any accidents from disturbing
you.”
Klein didn’t tarry. He took out the various ingredients and quickly set
up an altar, starting the mediumship ritual.
After reciting the incantations, he took a step back and used a Dream
Divination.
“Madam Sharon’s partners.
“Madam Sharon’s partners.”
…
After reciting the statement seven times, Klein entered a dream. He
saw Madam Sharon’s soul within the hazy world.
He reached out to the transparent, ethereal soul, and the scene before
his eyes changed.
It was a night scene. Madam Sharon, who was wearing a long black
robe, handed an ancient bronze book over to Instigator Trissy. She
laughed a little manically after hearing the latter’s doubt over the
term “Witch.”
“Weren’t you always curious? Curious about why our upper echelons
are all female…”
So it really was the Demoness Sect… Leonard’s guess accurately matches
the truth; he really does have a huge secret… The corresponding Sequence
7 for Assassin and Instigator is Witch? What a trap… Klein thought to
himself.
The scene immediately changed. Klein saw a vast hall with narrow
windows all around the place, and a lady clad in a pure white robe.
Her back was facing Madam Sharon as she said with a smile, “We can
reach sainthood as long as we advance towards the Primordial. We
can attain power, attain salvation, and avoid the end of days.”
Madam Sharon lowered her head and asked curiously, “Why must we
become women? Is it because the Primordial is a woman? Do women
symbolize destruction and calamity?”
The lady whose back was facing Madam Sharon answered calmly,
“No, men are the same, they are the synonym of war. These are two
similar pathways.”
Chapter 200: The Demoness of
Pleasure
Synonym of war… A similar Sequence as the Demoness Sequence
pathway… Which one would it be? Klein watched the movie-like scene
as he recalled the Sequence pathways that he knew of.
As he was only an oﬃcial Nighthawk, there was still a lot of
information that he couldn’t access. He was still in the dark about the
names of the Mid to High Sequences and their corresponding traits.
He only knew about the few that he had learned of from the Eternal
Blazing Sun, such as the Priest of Light and the Unshadowed; the God
of Combat Sequence pathway that he found out from the young man,
Sun, such as Dawn Paladin, Guardian, and Demon Hunter; as well as
Spirit Guide and Gatekeeper which he found out from Daly and
Dunn.
Hence, it was diﬃcult for him to judge which Sequence pathway
would be a synonym of war. He could only eliminate them one by
one, such as the God of Combat Sequence pathway which seemed
more like individual battles rather than war.
Klein thought about it and minimized the scope to ﬁve options.
First, was the Arbiter Sequence pathway which the Loen Kingdom’s
ruler, the Augustus family, and the Feynapotter Kingdom’s Castiya
family were in control of. But Klein felt that this option was the least
likely because the Arbiter’s corresponding Sequence 8 was Sheriﬀ and
Sequence 7 was Interrogator, which both seemed to be leaning
towards trial and judgment but not towards war.
Second, was the Fourth Epoch Solomon Empire’s pathway of the Dark
Emperor. Its Sequence 9’s modern name was Lawyer, which was good
at discovering and using the ﬂaws and weaknesses of an opponent,
while also possessing outstanding eloquence and logical thinking.
That was the second lowest possible Sequence pathway. He suspected
that the development of the Sequence would make use of rules and
walked in the shadow of order. Of course, war was also considered as
one of the shadows of order.
Third, was the Hunter Sequence pathway that was in the control of
the Feysac Empire’s rulers, the Einhorn family; the Intis Republic’s
former royal family, the Sauron family, and also the hidden
organization that only appeared in the last two to three hundred
years, the Iron and Blood Cross Order. Klein thought it was quite
possible.
The Nighthawk’s conﬁdential information described Hunters as
excellent trackers, outstanding trap masters, and superb hunters. The
corresponding Sequence 8 was Provoker, while Sequence 7 was
Pyromaniac. Both were partially associated with massacre and war.
Fourth was the ancient organization Blood Sanctify Sect that
worshiped demons. They were in control of the Criminal Sequence
pathway. From the sequence title itself, Klein felt that it had a high
possibility.
Fifth was the Rose School of Thought that was known for bloody
rituals. They had the Prisoner Sequence pathway, and the reason was
the same as the one before.
Just as Klein was drowning in his own thoughts, the scene before him
changed. Madam Sharon had just ﬁnished showering, and her wet
hair hung low. There was a fresh yet seductive charm on her face.
I can’t see the woman in the white robe that turned Madam Sharon into a
Demoness… It might be because my psychic ability is still lacking… Klein
reined back his thoughts and redirected his attention to what was
before his eyes.
Madam Sharon ﬂipped her hair, and water droplets glided down her
cheeks.
She looked towards the man who was waiting on the bed as she
giggled and said, “Do you need me to take care of Maynard?”
The middle-aged man on the bed creased his eyebrows and shook his
head. “Not unless you can guarantee that there won’t be any traces
left behind. But that’s impossible; besides, what means do you have?”
Looking at the man before him, Klein was taken aback at ﬁrst before
suddenly feeling that it was within expectations.
The middle-aged man’s photo often appeared on the front page of the
Tingen City Honest Paper and other newspapers. He was the current
mayor that was looking to be re-elected, a member of Conservative
Party.
Madam Sharon smiled but didn’t delve deeper into the topic. Her
robe was halfway up her legs, and she walked gracefully to the side
of the bed.
The scenery before him changed one after another until Klein saw
many Members of Parliament, businessmen, and civil servants who
appeared on the newspaper occasionally.
They would either discuss how to receive donations, bribe voters by
going around the Campaign Act, or promise protection and solve
problems. In the entire development, Madam Sharon acted as a
broker.
This is actually a documentary, right… “Tour the Upper Circles of Tingen
with Madam Sharon”… Well, but why are there so many bed scenes…
Many nobles and Members of Parliament knew that Madam Sharon had
many lovers, so why did they look like they couldn’t resist the
temptation… Was this an ability of Madam Sharon’s Sequence? Klein
watched thoughtfully as he speculated.
Through the divination earlier, he was certain that none of the guys
in Tingen’s upper circles knew of Madam Sharon’s true identity, nor
did they collude with her to murder Maynard.
In other words, Maynard’s death was Madam Sharon’s own decision?
Why? She had no reason to take the risk.
Of course, from Madam Sharon’s perspective, she possessed the Beyonder
power to interfere in divination, and she could also create a sudden death
from sexual pleasure and make the death appear natural and accidental.
Killing Maynard wasn’t something risky that would expose her identity,
but she clearly lacks a motive. It doesn’t match the risk involved!
Could it be one of the requirements of her “acting?” But she could
deﬁnitely ﬁnd someone whose identity and status wasn’t as sensitive.
Then, the case wouldn’t have fallen to the Nighthawks, Mandated
Punishers, or the Machinery Hivemind.
The most important point was that Madam Sharon should’ve been able to
tell that Maynard’s wife hated her and was extremely indignant. That
made it highly likely that someone would be sent to investigate her, so why
didn’t she move those sensitive items like the white bone statue away? She
could have buried it in the garden or something.
Was she so conﬁdent in the security of her safe and its hidden
compartment?
Amidst his suspicion, Klein saw that Madam Sharon’s spirit had yet to
disperse. He seized the opportunity to do another dream divination.
This time, his divination involved: “Madam Sharon’s true motive for
killing John Maynard.”
After he recited it in silence, Klein entered a dream once again and
saw a new scene.
Madam Sharon held a glass of red wine which resembled blood. In
her loose sleeping gown, she was pacing back and forth in her room.
Finally, she drank the rest of the wine in one gulp, as though she had
decided on something.
The scene dispersed quickly, leaving Klein even more confused since
Maynard’s death looked like Madam Sharon had volunteered to do it
without anyone’s instigation.
“That’s weird…” Klein muttered to himself and used another few
divination statements. But the answers were no diﬀerent.
Seeing that Madam Sharon was growing transparent and illusory,
signifying that she was going to disappear soon, Klein thought and
made ﬁnal contact with the dead spirit.
“Sequence potion formula of the Demoness pathway.
“Sequence potion formula of the Demoness pathway.”
…
Klein recited the new divination statement. With the aid of
Cogitation, he got into his dream very quickly.
At ﬁrst, he didn’t want to do the divination because he felt that the
Demoness pathway only spread disaster and created pain. Even if he
obtained a corresponding potion formula, he was unwilling to sell it
to anyone and indirectly become a murderer.
Then, he recalled another matter from before. With his understanding
of the Spectator potion, he had been able to suspect and verify that
Daxter Guderian was a member of the Psychology Alchemists.
So, in order to better ﬁght against the Demonesses in the future, he’d
to learn more of the traits of their Sequence pathway.
Yes, after Hood Eugen’s death, Daxter Guderian has yet to contact me.
I’m guessing the Psychology Alchemists sent some stronger members for an
investigation, and he hasn’t dared to make any moves… As Klein’s
thoughts ﬂashed, he saw the dark hall again. He saw the woman in
the holy white robe again.
Madam Sharon hung her head low, and she could only see the other
woman’s legs, a pair of ﬂawless legs.
Soon, she heard a melodious voice.
“Pleasure, that is the name of the Sequence 6 potion, the goal that
you are about to advance to. If you succeed, you’ll be a Demoness of
Pleasure.
“When pleasure is irresistible and impossible to break away from, it’s
a form of agony. This is also a maxim that you have to live by.
“As long as you complete your advancement, besides the
enhancement of your various abilities as a Witch, you’ll also become
more beautiful, making you better at seduction and providing
unforgettable pleasure to the same or opposite sex during love-
making. You’ll be able to make strange threads like a spider and
utilize them.”
Immediately following that, an ancient silver book appeared before
Madam Sharon. After it was opened, there was the formula and
ingredients placed separately.
“Main ingredients: A pair of Succubus eyes, an adult Black Widow
Spider Silk Gland.
“Supplementary ingredients: 100 ml of puriﬁed water, 5 drops of
Black Jimsonweed juice, the complete remnants of a Succubus’s hair,
10 grams of Feynapotter Fly Powder, and 5 grams of real Mummy
ashes.”
The scene changed again. It was the same hall, the same long white
robe, and the same woman with indistinguishable features. But now,
the diﬀerence was that Madam Sharon had returned to her original
state. She was now the young man in the picture from before.
A melodious female voice reverberated in his ears.
“This is the name of the Sequence 7 potion, I’m sure you’re
surprised.”
“Yes, I still can’t believe it’s called Witch!” “Madam Sharon” said in a
rather agitated manner.
“Remember, if we want to get closer to the Primordial, we have to be
more and more like ‘Her.’ She’s a woman, so we have to be women
too,” The melodious female voice replied. “Either you give up or you
accept. After you become a Witch, you’ll become a true woman, and
your appearance and charm will be enhanced substantially. You’ll
have the ability to turn invisible and use substitutes. You’ll gain a
rudimentary mastery of various dark magic, you’ll be skilled at
disrupting the divination of others, and you’ll also gain the favor of
the black ﬂame and icy frost.
“The main ingredients are every drop of an Abyss Demonic Fish’s
blood and an Agate Peacock’s egg.
“The supplementary ingredients are 80 ml of puriﬁed water, ﬁve
drops of Jimsonweed juice, 3 scales of a Shadow Lizard, and 10 drops
of Daﬀodil Juice.”
…
Scenes continued to play, one after another, and Klein saw the
Instigator and Assassin formula and understood their corresponding
traits.
Just as he wanted to continue the divination, Madam Sharon’s spirit
dispersed completely.
Klein stopped the ritual and returned to reality. He packed up the
ingredients, removed the wall of spirituality, and told Dunn Smith
about the outcome of his mediumship without holding back any
information. Then, he expressed his suspicions on Madam Sharon’s
murder of Maynard.
“Pleasure doesn’t require her to kill anyone of a higher rank or
position in society… Hmm, we need to investigate where Madam
Sharon has been over the past few years and understand her origins.
We need to look for the dark hall that you saw. Of course, this will
need to be reported to the Holy Cathedral, and they can assign
investigators accordingly. We can’t leave Tingen as we wish.” Dunn
nodded slightly and looked around. He said, “Go to the ﬁrst ﬂoor,
check if those servants are still in deep sleep. If anyone is awake,
bring them over and make them sign a conﬁdentiality contract as per
protocol. I’ll be in charge of the second ﬂoor.”
He found a black cloth and covered the Sealed Artifact 3-0271.
Upon hearing that, Klein suddenly understood why the intense battle
hadn’t brought the servants over—the Captain had sent them into a
deep sleep from the very beginning.
Klein’s body was still cold and stiﬀ. He had to slow down and move
forward in very, very light steps.
When he passed the bedroom door, he extended his hand and pulled
out the two Tarot cards at the door. He wiped them and put them
back into his pocket.
After he left the room, he walked towards the stairway.
After taking a few steps, he suddenly thought of a question—how
would he make sure that the person was in a deep sleep?
Check with divination one by one? That’d be troublesome… The Captain
is a Nightmare; he should be an expert in this. I’ll have to ask him if he
has any fast and simple methods.
With this in mind, Klein turned around walked towards the bedroom
door, step by step, as he fought against the cold and stiﬀness in his
body.
Before he came close, he looked through the ajar door and saw the
shattered pieces of the angled full-body mirror.
There were still large shards of the mirror clinging to the frame, all
the size of a palm.
In the cracked mirror, Dunn Smith, in his black windbreaker, was
kneeling beside Kenley’s dead body, doing something.
Suddenly, he lifted his head. His gray eyes were deep, and the
corners of his lips were tainted with crimson blood.
Crimson blood.
Without thinking, Klein turned around, left the side of the door, and
leaned his back against the wall.
Chapter 201: Inquiry
Klein held his breath with his back against the wall as he faced the
darkness of the corridor.
What’s Captain doing? What’s wrong with him? Was he drinking
blood? Is this a sign of him losing control? Klein’s mind was a mess,
incapable of eﬀective thought.
Nearly twenty seconds later, Klein clenched his teeth. With the help
of the control he had over his body as a Clown, he silently made his
way down the stairs.
Later, he then intentionally took heavier footsteps and made his way
back to the door of Madam Sharon’s bedroom.
Klein looked in to see the Captain wrapping Sealed Artifact 3-0271
with the black cloth. His expression was serious, his face clean.
It was as though what Klein had seen just now was only an illusion.
Glancing sideways, Klein saw nothing abnormal with Kenley’s body.
It was the same as it had been.
He inhaled and asked, “Captain, how am I going to conﬁrm if those
servants are still asleep? I can’t make an accurate judgment just based
on Spirit Vision alone. They’ll have various emotional reactions due
to their dreams which will be reﬂected in the color of their auras.”
Dunn Smith ﬁddled with the Spirit Medium Mirror and was silent for
a few seconds. He said with a raspy voice, “I’m sorry. I forgot about
that. I’ve made too many mistakes tonight.
“There’s no need for you to check, I’ll conﬁrm it.”
He lifted his hand and pressed his glabella, then he closed his eyes,
allowing formless ripples to spread towards the ﬁrst ﬂoor.
It was crystal-clear to a Nightmare if anyone was asleep or not.
Klein froze when he saw this. He looked down and bit at the insides
of his lips.
Captain, were you really drawing me away just now…
What are you doing? Do you know what you’re doing…
He abruptly turned to look at the window, only to see the crimson
moon hanging high in the sky, seemingly unchanged for thousands of
years.
After collecting himself, Klein used the cover of picking up his tarot
cards, revolver, half top hat, and other items to closely examine the
corpses of Kenley and Madam Sharon.
They maintained the same look as when they died, but their skin was
turning pale at a rapid rate. They also had tinges of blue and black
marks.
It’s a little weird, they seem to be missing something… It’s not
something speciﬁc, but more of a feeling… Klein muttered to himself.
He felt his hair stand on end due to the chilly wind blowing through
the shattered window.
At that moment, Dunn opened his eyes and said in a deep voice,
“They’re all still asleep, but some of them are close to waking up.”
“That’s good, that’s good…” Klein looked at the Captain, not knowing
what he was saying.
Dunn surveyed the surroundings and said, “Clean up the scene, then
get someone from the nearest police station to come over. Oh, and
make a trip back to Zouteland Street and get Frye to come help out.”
Klein gave the Captain a deep look and nodded with his teeth
clenched.
“Okay.”
With Dunn’s help, Klein quickly cleaned up the scene and left Madam
Sharon’s house through the front door.
Walking through the garden and coming outside, Klein couldn’t help
but look back. All he saw was the silent nursery in the darkness.
There was no light at all.
He turned, his heart heavy. He soon located the nearest police station
based on his memory—this was common knowledge to the
Nighthawks.
Knock. Knock. Knock. Klein knocked on the steel door.
Sometime later, the oﬃcer on duty passed through the courtyard
with a lantern in hand. He opened the door and observed Klein
suspiciously.
“What’s the matter?”
Klein failed to force any expression. With a heavy face, he produced
his documents and showed it to the police oﬃcer.
“There’s a serious murder case at 15 Osna Street. Immediately call for
other oﬃcers to head there to help out!”
The police oﬃcer lifted his lantern and scrutinized the documents
before putting his feet together and saluted.
“Yes, sir!”
Having settled this, Klein headed back to Zouteland Street on a rental
carriage.
On the way back, he sat in the dark carriage. His thoughts were in a
mess and unfocused.
Kenley is dead…
I remember that he was recently engaged… His parents are still
alive…
What was the Captain doing just now…
Does he crave fresh blood…
Or does he have other motives…
His memory is still as poor as before, without any obvious
improvement. Th-this means that he doesn’t have the warning signs
of losing control!
But he’s known about the “acting method” for some time now. Does
the fact that his memory hasn’t improved mean that there’s a
problem…
No! It must be because the Captain is still ﬁguring out the proper way
to act as a Nightmare!
… Yes, the most important reasons why Kenley died was because of
Sealed Artifact 3-0271. It was the Captain who gave it to him…
What am I thinking! It was a logical decision back then!
… It was also the Captain who suggested using Sealed Artifact
3-0271…
Calm down, calm down, I cannot make blind guesses. But I cannot
wait around either, or the situation might worsen!
I’ll send a letter to Madam Daly later and see if she knows what this
situation means. Even if she doesn’t know the exact answer, she’ll
deﬁnitely understand the signs of danger and inform the Holy
Cathedral…
That way, we can smother the problem in the cradle and get the
Captain back to normal!
No, the Captain might not have a problem. I might’ve misunderstood
something. I’ll see what Madam Daly says…
…
Klein had already made a decision when the carriage arrived at 36
Zouteland Street. He was no longer ﬂustered and helpless as before.
He went up the stairway toward the entrance of the Blackthorn
Security Company with heavy steps and opened the door from a key
he ﬁshed out.
The familiar setting calmed him down considerably. It reminded him
of how he felt when he asked the Captain for help every time
something was wrong.
Taking a deep breath, Klein went to the recreation room and found
Frye reading alone under the gas lamp.
Frye turned to look at Klein, his cold face revealing a look of concern
and worry.
“Did something happen? Where’s Captain and Kenley?”
Klein replied with a raspy voice, “Kenley’s dead; he died at Madam
Sharon’s hands. We all made mistakes… The Captain is guarding the
scene. He needs your help there.”
Before they left, the Captain had informed Frye about the general
situation. He told Frye that if they weren’t back within two hours, he
was to send a telegraph to the Holy Cathedral. Similarly, since they
had to apply for Sealed Artifact 3-0271 and enter Chanis Gate at
night, Royale, who was guarding Chanis Gate was also notiﬁed of the
mission. According to the internal guidelines of the Nighthawks, a
Captain could permit the opening of Chanis Gate at night. If the
Captain was present, then only the Captain could enter.
Frye froze for a moment, then he let out a sigh. He drew a crimson
moon on his chest.
He put on his coat and hat and headed out the door. When he walked
past Klein, he suddenly said softly, “You don’t need to blame
yourself. Making mistakes is something we can never avoid. We must
always trust our partners.”
“Yeah…” Klein closed his eyes, his vision turning blurry.
Klein and Frye ﬁrst headed to the basement to notify Royale before
locking the door to the Blackthorn Security Company and rushing to
Madam Sharon’s house.
It was nearing dawn by the time they got Kenley’s corpse and Madam
Sharon’s half decapitated body back.
Dunn stood in front of the mortuary, silently looking inside. It was
some time before he turned to Klein and said, “Go home ﬁrst. You
just experienced an intense battle, you must be exhausted.”
“Alright.” Klein didn’t reject the suggestion.
He puckered his lips and stole a glance at the Captain before quietly
leaving the Blackthorn Security Company. He took a carriage back to
Daﬀodil Street.
Just as he had done the previous time, he easily entered his bedroom
and locked the door.
Taking out the silver ritual dagger, Klein sealed the room with a wall
of spirituality. He then sat at his desk and wrote urgently:
“Dear Madam Daly,
“I’ve noticed that there’s something odd about the Captain recently.
During a mission, he secretly…”
Klein stopped when he reached this point. His mind had gone blank.
He didn’t know how to continue or how to describe the incident.
Pa!
He threw the pen and crumpled the piece of paper in front of him
into a ball. Looking at it, he pounded heavily on the table, sending a
reverberating thump across the room. Klein closed his eyes and
covered his face with his hands. He didn’t move, as if he had become
a statue.
Five minutes later, he sighed. He put down his right hand and burned
the ball of paper with his spirituality. He watched it turn to ash as it
fell into the bin.
After organizing his thoughts, Klein took out a fresh piece of paper
and wrote:
“Dear Madam Daly,
“We just completed a mission and regrettably lost a partner. The
exact details are as follows…
“… Back then, I felt that with my present standards, my Spirit Vision
was incapable of accurately ascertaining whether the servants were
asleep or not, and that it was very troublesome to do divinations for
every one of them. Thus, I returned with the intention of asking for
the Captain’s advice. At that moment, through the mirror’s reﬂection,
I saw the Captain kneeling beside Kenley’s corpse, with crimson
blood covering his mouth.
“I’m not sure what exactly happened, nor do I know the state the
Captain is in. I hope that you can give me an answer.”
…
After writing this, Klein read the letter again with a heavy heart
before folding it in half.
He then set up a ritual and activated his Spirit Vision to summon
Daly’s messenger. He summoned the strange face which was only a
mouth without any eyes or nose.
He saw the red tongue laced with irregular sharp teeth and ﬁve pale
ﬁngers on the tip of the tongue. Klein silently handed the letter over.
When everything was restored back to normal again, he sat down and
continued writing.
This time, he planned to ask Mr. Azik.
“… On a recent mission, something strange happened to my superior.
He sent me away and kneeled beside the corpse of a teammate. His
mouth was covered in crimson blood.
“Have you encountered something like this in your memories before?
How can I help my superior?”
Chapter 202: Conﬁrming the
Situation
After folding the letter, Klein took out the copper whistle, put it to his
lips, and blew hard.
In the silence, illusory white bones came ﬂying up from the desk like
a fountain and ﬁnally formed a huge monster. It was almost four
meters tall, still covered in a faint glow. Its head was still poking
through the ceiling, looking no diﬀerent from before.
Klein ﬂicked his wrist and threw the letter. The white bone monster
caught the letter and gripped it tight
Klein blew the copper whistle again and saw the messenger break
into illusory white bones and fall like rain before vanishing through
the surface of the desk.
Klein felt much calmer after ﬁnishing everything, but he didn’t stop
trying. He moved the chair back and stood up. He then walked four
steps counterclockwise and entered the world above the gray fog.
The lofty palace and the ancient mottled table appeared before his
eyes, as though it would stay the same for tens of thousand of years.
Klein sat at The Fool’s seat of honor. Then, he took out the spirit
pendulum from his left sleeve and conjured a yellowish-brown
goatskin and a fountain pen in front of him.
He wanted to divine the Captain’s situation that night!
After some thought, Klein wrote the ﬁrst divination statement.
“Dunn Smith’s abnormality would lead me into danger.”
In mysticism, divination that involved any danger to the diviner was
hardest to infer. It was an instinctual ability of spirituality.
In other words, as long as there wasn’t an extremely strong
disturbance, Klein would be able to get an accurate result from the
divination about his own situation.
This was also the reason why he would divine if there was danger in
the mission even though he knew that Madam Sharon had the ability
to interfere with divination. He also knew that Madam Sharon wasn’t
strong enough to aﬀect this kind of divination.
In order to determine Captain Dunn Smith’s situation, he decided to
eliminate all disturbances and perform the divination above the gray
fog.
He held the pendulum with his left hand as he recited the divination
statement seven times. He closed his eyes and entered a Cogitation
state.
After a few seconds, he opened his eyes and they returned to their
normal color.
He looked at the topaz pendant, and he felt heavy-hearted because
the pendulum was spinning clockwise. The rotation wasn’t small, nor
was the speed slow.
It meant that the result was positive.
It meant that Dunn Smith’s abnormality would lead him to danger!
And the danger level was signiﬁcant!
After he closed his eyes, Klein “wiped” away the previous content
and wrote down a new divination statement.
“The reason for Dunn Smith’s abnormality.”
He put away the topaz pendant and leaned back into the chair. He
recited the divination statement as he entered a dream with the aid
of Cogitation.
In the blurry illusory world, he couldn’t see or discover anything.
There was nothing except gray fog.
That means that there was insuﬃcient information, so the divination
failed… Klein looked at the goatskin on the long bronze table as he
muttered bitterly and helplessly.
Suddenly, he felt a strong feeling of exhaustion. He realized that it
was the result of an intense battle, continuous rituals, and multiple
divinations.
Klein wrapped himself up with spirituality and stimulated a rapid
descent from above the gray fog and returned to reality.
He had a few nightmares that night. The ending of each dream was
either Kenley vomiting his organs, or Dunn Smith with crimson blood
around his mouth.
…
The next morning, Klein was on duty at Chanis Gate so he arrived
early at the Blackthorn Security Company.
At that very moment, Rozanne, Mrs. Orianna, and the other clerks
had yet to arrive for work. Klein walked through the partition and
saw the wide open door and Dunn Smith, who was seated in the
Captain’s oﬃce.
Dunn had taken oﬀ his coat, and he only had his white shirt and
black vest on. He sat in his seat while he held a cup of coﬀee in his
hands. He was staring at the wall in front of him blankly.
His hair seemed dry, his gray eyes looked dull, and his face was
showing obvious signs of weariness too.
Even for the Captain, who’s experienced many similar incidents, it’s still
unbearable to lose two teammates in such a short period of time… Klein’s
heart winced as the scene of the shattered full-body mirror reﬂecting
Dunn kneeling before Kenley’s corpse with his face covered in
crimson blood appeared once again.
Klein clenched his teeth and looked away.
After nearly twenty seconds, he composed himself and extended his
hand to knock on the Captain’s door.
Knock! Knock! Knock!
Dunn put down his coﬀee cup as his gray eyes became deep again.
He took a deep breath and said, “I’ve reported the matter to the Holy
Cathedral, and they gave an initial reply.
“The Church will compensate Kenley’s family with 3000 pounds, and
the police department will give 1000 pounds as bereavement
payment…”
A total of 4000 pounds. To most middle-class citizens, that’s wealth that
can’t be earned in a lifetime… Kenley’s weekly salary was seven pounds,
making an annual income of 364 pounds. Adding in any bonuses and
additional income, he would make at least 380 pounds. Four thousand
pounds is equivalent to ten years of his income… Such wealth can provide
at least 200 pounds of income a year… Although money cannot make up
for the loss of Kenley, it’s the only eﬀective thing at the moment… Klein
had many thoughts passing through his mind before he ﬁnally sighed.
“That’s all we can do.”
The Church of the Evernight Goddess couldn’t be faulted when it
came to such matters.
Dunn pulled his collar and said in a deep voice, “Go to the basement
and take over Royale’s shift.”
“Alright.” Klein nodded slightly.
He turned around and walked towards the door. Then, he heard
Captain add as though he was talking to himself, “We’ll send Kenley
home later…”
Send Kenley home… His father, his mother, his siblings, his ﬁancée, how
will they react… Klein’s heart tightened, and he was somehow glad
that he didn’t have to face such sorrow.
He knew it was the mentality of an escapist, but he was really afraid
of seeing the agony in the eyes of Kenley’s parents, or how his ﬁancée
would seem to lose her soul. He was afraid to see their expressions of
hidden resentment and afraid of hearing their sobbing.
Klein quickened his pace and hurried to Chanis Gate. He completed
the shift change with Royale in silence.
He sat in the duty room and occasionally took out his silver pocket
watch and watched the time pass by slowly.
After an unknown period of time, Klein suddenly heard illusory
sounds that overlapped one another.
He saw the four black dots appear on the back of his hand and
understood that it was either Justice, The Hanged Man, or The Sun
praying to him.
He had no way to answer them immediately. He could only wait till
the notiﬁcation ended, for more prayers to come, and until the next
morning when he returned home.
Having just ﬁshed his keys to open the door to his house, Klein saw
the maidservant Bella wiping the dining table while his sister,
Melissa, who was dressed up, and his brother, Benson, came
downstairs.
“Didn’t you just go to Mass last week?” Klein asked curiously.
Benson smiled and said, “That sounds like the memory of a person
who hasn’t gotten any sleep the entire night.”
“Huh?” Klein looked even more confused.
“Today is the ﬁrst day that ‘The Return of the Count’ will be releasing
tickets for sale,” Melissa explained.
Klein smacked his forehead and took oﬀ his hat.
“I’ve been too busy recently. I totally forgot about it.”
Especially these past three days… He added with a sigh.
Melissa looked at him with concern and said, “Your breakfast is in
the kitchen. Eat it and get some sleep. Benson and I thought that
since we’re going out, we might as well drop by Saint Selena
Cathedral to have Mass.”
“Alright.” Klein waved and bade his brother and sister farewell. He
had a simple breakfast and returned to his bedroom.
After he did the preparatory work, he took four steps
counterclockwise and entered the world above the gray fog. He saw
that Justice and The Hanged Man’s corresponding crimson stars were
burgeoning and shrinking faintly.
He extended his right hand and emanated his spirituality. Then,
blurry images formed before Klein’s eyes. Miss Justice’s prayer
sounded in his ears.
…
“I pray for you to listen.
“Because of the Qilangos incident, my father hired a Beyonder to
protect me. There are also others who are watching over me secretly.
It wasn’t easy for me to ﬁnally ﬁnd an opportunity to pray to you. I
would like to apply for leave from the Gathering next week. I believe
this will pass soon.”
Klein subconsciously glanced at the blurry image. The image was
ﬁlled with fog, and there seemed to be a huge bathtub with rippling
water. Miss Justice was wrapped in a bath towel.
He retracted his gaze and started listening to The Hanged Man’s
prayer.
His description was diﬀerent from Justice’s, but he was making the
same request. He too needed to ask for leave due to the aftermath of
Qilangos’s death.
Klein nodded slightly and responded to their prayers respectively.
“I’m aware.”
Then, he sent a message to The Sun’s crimson star.
“The upcoming Gathering will be canceled temporarily.”
…
City of Silver.
Derrick Berg was paying attention in the training ﬁeld. The sky above
his head was still dark, with occasional ﬂashes of lightning that lit up
the sky.
Suddenly, his vision went blurry before he saw the thick fog and the
ancient palace that looked like the home of a giant. He also saw Mr.
Fool, who sat in the depths of the gray fog.
“The upcoming Gathering will be canceled temporarily.”
His voice reverberated, but the view before Derrick had already
returned to normal.
He wasn’t shocked at such a magical incident because Mr. Fool
contacted him in this manner to remind him before every Gathering.
Derrick looked up at the woman in front of him subconsciously, a
member of the City of Silver’s six-member council, Shepherd Lloydia.
This terrifying expert kept switching between a smile and being
aloof. She told every young man at the training ﬁeld that they would
join the patrolling troops soon and rid the dark monsters in the
vicinity. That wouldn’t be training anymore.
Elder Lloydia didn’t notice anything strange… She seems to be getting
weirder. Is it because there’s a High-Sequence Beyonder’s evil spirit among
the souls that she grazes? Derrick thought.
…
Klein returned to his bedroom, threw himself into bed, and quickly
fell asleep. He dreamed about what had happened these past few
days.
Suddenly, he felt like he was being shaken by someone, and he
suddenly woke up.
Klein opened eyes and saw a gigantic white bone hand.
The hand paused and threw the letter on the bed. Then, it vanished
into thin air.
Mr. Azik’s reply… Klein grabbed the letter, full of hope.
Chapter 203: Mutant
Klein opened the letter, feeling both expectant and nervous before he
began reading Azik’s reply.
“… I thought about a few possibilities regarding the scenario you
described, and I remembered a few things about Vampires and
Mutants.
“Natural vampires were already on the brink of extinction before the
dragons and giants bowed out of the stage of world history. Later on,
they might occasionally be discovered. The Vampires we usually talk
about, as well as those mentioned in folklore, are more similar to
Beyonders. I recall that the name of a potion in a particular pathway
is called Vampire.
“If your superior is now in a half-insane state, then it’s very likely
that he mistakenly consumed such a potion. The result of mixing two
potions from diﬀerent pathways makes a half-insane state a certainty.
Yes, I vaguely remember the pathway of the Evernight, which is also
the Sleepless pathway as you know it, can be interchanged at High
Sequences with the pathway of Death and the pathway of Giants. But
it doesn’t include the Vampire pathway.
“Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility that your superior
might have accepted it willingly. After all, Vampires have a long life,
an exceptional constitution, and excellent looks. When compared
with these beneﬁts, accepting a state of half-insanity is reasonable.”
Klein froze when he read the letter. He didn’t expect Mr. Azik to
provide him with this much information.
The Death pathway is also known as the Corpse Collector pathway. It can
be interchanged at High Sequences with the Sleepless pathway. I knew
about this from Emperor Roselle’s diary. But to think that it can also be
interchanged with the Giant pathway after Sequence 4… The Giant
pathway is the one that the City of Silver possesses, which is also the
present-day God of Combat pathway… I’ve always suspected that Giant
King Aurmir was the ancient God of Combat…
Yes, Emperor Roselle’s diary described the Church of the Evernight
Goddess and the Church of the God of Combat as mortal enemies… Could
this be because the pathways they possess can be interchanged at higher
sequences?
If I follow this line of thought, I can ﬁnd an explanation as to why the
three ancient churches, the Church of the Lord of Storms, the Church of
the Eternal Blazing Sun, and the Church of the God of Knowledge and
Wisdom, are at odds with each other. That’s because the pathways of
Sailor, Bard, and Reader can be interchanged at High Sequences!
Yes, during the end of the previous Epoch, the Pale Era, it ‘s likely that the
fall of Death was caused by the Evernight Goddess and the God of
Combat…
The Captain is perfectly ﬁne usually, other than his poor memory. He
doesn’t show any signs of half-insanity. I can rule out the possibility of
him consuming the Vampire potion!
Mr. Azik has recalled quite a number of things recently… Could the
Creeping Hunger have really stimulated his memories?
Klein nodded and continued reading the letter.
“Mutant isn’t the name of a particular species. It’s more like the
description for many similar creatures. Under normal circumstances,
they’re no diﬀerent from an ordinary human, but there is an innate,
suppressed, twisted desire in their hearts. This desire erupts when
they come into contact with a certain scene or object. They become
monsters, succumbing to their desires for blood and massacre.
“After everything settles, they will return to normal again. They
become slightly more merciless and unfeeling after each time their
desires erupt, this will continue until their souls are completely
twisted.
“The only example of this that I can recall is the werewolf. They’re
similar to humans for the most part, and they cannot be distinguished
using most Beyonder abilities. But, during the full moon, the twisted
desires in their hearts intensify, and their bodies also change
accordingly.
“Your superior might be a potential Mutant. The death of your
teammate might have triggered his true nature.
“These are all my personal guesses. I cannot guarantee that there are
no other possibilities since I haven’t gotten all my memories back.
Perhaps your theory of this being a precursor to losing control can
also explain this.
“There’s no saving him whether he has consumed the Vampire
potion, or if he’s a Mutant. Of course, many people have theorized
that Mutants were originally ordinary human beings, but were put
under a strange curse or corrupted by some evil god or devil, and,
thus, transform into a diﬀerent monster under certain circumstances.
“Also, I’m not too sure if you can treat him when you notice the
warning signs of losing control. I would advise that you report this
directly to your superior’s superior and hope that there’s still time.”
Klein looked gravely at the desk after placing the letter down. He
slipped into deep thought.
He had to admit that the theory of a Mutant was a very possible one,
but he couldn’t eliminate the possibility that it was a warning sign to
him losing control.
All I can do is wait for Madam Daly’s reply… I sent the letter two nights
ago, so she should’ve received the letter yesterday morning. If she replied
immediately, I should’ve seen the letter last night or this morning… It’s
almost noon… Does that messenger not dare to go near Chanis Gate? Or
was Madam Daly held up by something? Klein shook his head. He still
felt exhausted and used Cogitation to force himself to sleep.
In the hazy world, Klein was suddenly jolted to his senses. He knew
that he was dreaming.
He then saw Dunn Smith in his black windbreaker appear in front of
him.
Responding in a manner congruent with a normal dream, Klein gave
a delayed greeting, “Good morning… Captain…”
Dunn nodded slightly and said, “Leonard found a clue when he was
investigating the Lanevus case. He needs your help. The Mystery
Pryer that the Holy Cathedral sent over won’t arrive until tomorrow
morning because of a train fault.”
“Alright…” Klein replied in a ﬂeeting voice.
Dunn thought for a moment before adding, “There’s no need for you
to return to Zouteland Street. Head to 62 Howes Street directly.
Leonard will be there waiting for you. It’s been hard on you.”
The moment he ﬁnished his sentence, Klein’s dream shattered. Klein
instinctively opened his eyes.
Howes Street… Isn’t that the area where the Divination Club, my
classmate Welch, and the member of the Aurora Order lived? There sure
are many incidents lately, one after another, as if they’re culminating in
something… Klein thought as he got up slowly. He washed up in the
bathroom before changing into a white shirt, brown vest, and black
windbreaker. He then picked up his hat and went down to the living
room.
It wasn’t eleven yet, and Benson and Melissa hadn’t returned home.
Klein informed Bella that he was going out and that she didn’t need
to prepare lunch for him.
He then took a public carriage to Howes Street and saw the messy-
haired Midnight Poet—Leonard Mitchell, whose hair exuded beauty,
waiting for him in at building 62.
Leonard was still in a thin white shirt despite the chilly September
weather. He had paired it with beige pants. He swept his green eyes
at Klein.
“This might be the building rented by Lanevus under a false name.”
“How did you ﬁgure it out?” Klein asked out of curiosity.
Leonard pointed to his head.
“Since you found a clue from Hood Eugen and suspected that
Lanevus was likely connected to that member of the Aurora Order—
the cloth merchant Sirius Arapis—I had to change my line of thinking
after my normal investigations revealed nothing. I started
investigating the Aurora Order.
“The previous report told me that Sirius had interactions with many
of the residents on Howes Street, so I searched every one of them and
found a problem with this one.”
“What problem?” Klein asked.
Leonard raised his brows. “An obvious problem. The guest here
appears very rarely. He claimed to be going to the Southern
Continent to do business after Hanass Vincent’s death and never
returned. His records are very realistic, and the police didn’t discover
anything.”
“This could only be a coincidence.” Klein creased his brows.
“Of course, a coincidence. But when I showed the residents around
here Lanevus’s picture, an old man felt that he looked similar to the
resident at number 62, other than his diﬀerent glasses.” Leonard took
out a black-and-white photograph from his pocket.
Why didn’t you say so earlier… Klein lampooned inwardly. He entered
62 Howes Street with Leonard, and at Leonard’s request, he started to
divine if there were any hidden compartments or secret chambers.
The result was yes!
“The secret chamber or hidden compartment in this building.”
Klein wrote down another divination statement. He took a seat on the
sofa and closed his eyes as he recited the statement.
Seven times later, he entered a dream. His vision was blurry.
In the blurry world, Klein saw a wooden bookshelf. He saw rows
upon rows of books. He saw that one of the books had been taken
away. He saw the wooden surface beside the book open, revealing a
hidden compartment.
The scene quickly disappeared as Klein opened his eyes and told
Leonard, “In the study.”
Klein wound the topaz pendulum around his wrist and followed
Leonard into the study. He saw the wooden bookshelf he had seen in
his dream.
“Pull out that book, the place it’s covering has a hidden
compartment.” Klein pointed at the book nearest to the sides.
“So it’s here… I couldn’t ﬁnd anything when I searched the place,
and I had no choice but to return to Zouteland Street to request for
help,” Leonard grumbled as he walked over. He pulled out the book
Klein had pointed out.
After searching the area, he ﬁnally found the mechanism to open the
hidden compartment.
A letter lay silently in the hidden compartment.
A letter? Lanevus hid a letter here? Klein found it extremely strange.
After he divined to see if there was anything dangerous within the
letter and received a negative answer, Leonard picked up the letter
and opened the unmarked envelope.
Leonard pulled out the letter within and unfolded it.
Klein leaned forward to get a look of its contents. All he saw were the
ﬁrst few paragraphs of the letter:
“Hahaha, congratulations. Congratulations on ﬁnally ﬁnding this
letter!
“This means that you’re not too stupid, nor too slow. You qualify to
take part in this game of life and death that I’ve designed.
“Child laborers that die before their time. Factory workers who
seldom live past ten years after entering the factory because of their
working conditions. Female workers who risk severe illnesses for a
meager salary. I see boundless resentment surrounding every factory,
turning the surroundings oppressive and gloomy. This is the worst of
times, and also the best of times. Our game shall take place under
such a setting.
“Fools, prepare yourselves, I’m going to issue you a hint!”
Chapter 204: Visitor
Klein and Leonard lifted their gaze from the letter and exchanged
glances. They muttered, “He’s crazy, right?”
“Lanevus is secretly a lunatic?”
A lunatic who truly has a delusional disorder and an antisocial
personality… Klein thought and felt a tug at his heartstrings. He
quickly redirected his gaze to the letter.
“Ladies and gentlemen, the hint is that I’ve placed a bomb in Tingen,
a bomb that will grow stronger over time.
“Seek it and ﬁnish it before it explodes. If you lose the game, there
will be a boom, and the entire city of Tingen will be reduced to a
ruin. Trust me, I’m not lying at all about this.
“—Lanevus, who enjoys giving his friends pleasant surprises.”
“A bomb?” Klein looked at Leonard and muttered to himself,
perplexed.
Leonard held the letter up to the sunlight and looked as he ﬂipped it
around. He didn’t ﬁnd any other clues.
“The term ‘bomb’ is probably an expression. I’ve never heard of a
bomb that can grow stronger.”
Klein creased his eyebrows and said thoughtfully, “No, I mean, he
might be using ‘bomb’ to reference something in mysticism. Such as
an evil ritual that continuously accumulates power…”
Leonard cocked his head as though he was listening to something
when suddenly, his facial expression grew solemn.
He nodded as his green eyes constricted. “Maybe you’re right. Isn’t
there a description at the beginning of the letter? Child laborers that
die before their time, factory workers who seldom live past ten years
after entering the factory because of their working conditions, female
workers who risk severe illnesses for a meager salary… Boundless
resentment surrounding every factory… Perhaps, that might be the
energy source that constantly strengthens Lanevus’s bomb.”
“Yes… that’s very possible!” Klein suddenly tensed up and said, “We
need to report to the Captain immediately!”
Leonard laughed and said, “There’s no need to be so nervous. You
should know that Lanevus is a Swindler. The part where he said that
he didn’t lie might be a lie itself.
“Of course, regardless, we have to return to Zouteland Street to
report to the Captain. It’s best if we can request the Holy Cathedral to
send a mysticism expert over and ﬁnd the location of the altar
through the abnormal accumulation of resentment.”
Someone is apparently very familiar with protocol… But why would the
setup of such an altar need Hood Eugen’s help? What role does a
Psychiatrist play in this? Klein didn’t object to the idea. He left 62
Howes Street with Leonard and rushed back to Zouteland Street on a
hired carriage.
Just as they entered the Blackthorn Security Company’s door, Klein
saw two familiar faces, one voluptuous and one scrawny. They were
Maynard’s wife and sister.
They were still in black dresses and black hats. The ﬁne checkered
black gauze concealed their faces.
The two ladies were chatting with Rozanne, and when they suddenly
saw Klein’s return, they turned around and walked forward.
“You really are the cream of the crop in this industry.” Mrs. Maynard
nodded slightly and said in a low voice, “I’m very pleased with the
outcome and am also impressed with your work approach. Here’s the
reward that you deserve.”
The scrawny woman passed a light brown paper bag to Klein. It was
ﬁlled with thick stacks of cash. There were ten pound notes, ﬁve
pound notes, one pound notes, and also ﬁve soli and one soli.
“It’s a total of 230 pounds,” the scrawny lady stated simply.
Klein was in no mood to pay any attention to the money. He passed it
to Rozanne and said, “Take this to Mrs. Orianna. I doubt the two
respectable women would make a mistake counting the money.”
At that moment, the corner of his eyes caught the Tingen City Honest
Paper in Mrs. Maynard’s hands. On the most eye-catching spot on the
front page, there were two pieces of news.
Old baron’s widow dies in involvement with MP Maynard’s murder.
Mayor Dennis takes the blame for the worsening public security in Tingen
for the past three months and resigns.
So that’s the oﬃcial excuse for Madam Sharon’s case? I’ve yet to read the
newspaper today… Klein nodded at the two ladies and followed
Leonard through the partition to the Captain’s oﬃce.
“How was it? Did you ﬁnd any clues?” Dunn Smith closed his
document, lifted his head, and looked at Klein and Leonard with his
deep gray eyes.
“We found a letter that was left behind by Lanevus.” Leonard didn’t
provide any further descriptions and simply passed the Captain the
letter ﬁlled with madness and provocation.
Dunn opened the letter and scanned through it quickly. He rubbed
his temples as he said, “He really is a lunatic.”
“He’s only a Sequence 8, Sequence 7 at most.”
Klein agreed from the bottom of his heart. “Lanevus is a dangerous
ﬁgure who can damage the stability of social order. Even though he’s
weak, we can’t belittle him.”
Then, he told Captain about his and Leonard’s assumption.
Dunn touched his receding hairline as he said, “That was my thought
as well. I’ll immediately send a telegram to the Holy Cathedral and
ask them to send a mysticism expert over for assistance.
“Who knows how dangerous Lanevus’s bomb could be. We have to be
extremely careful. When the Holy Cathedral replies to me, I’ll arrange
for the follow-up.”
Klein and Leonard exchanged glances and nodded simultaneously as
they said, “Alright.”
Seizing the moment when Captain was sending a telegram to the
Holy Cathedral, Klein returned to the reception hall to grab a copy of
the Tingen City Honest Paper from Rozanne.
He stood at the partition and read the two articles with full
concentration.
“… The widow of the old baron of the Khoy family, Madam Sharon,
was suspected to be involved in the sudden death of Member of
Parliament Maynard… The police received a tip and took action at
night. They discovered that Madam Sharon and her accomplice had
knocked out her servants to carry out a pagan ceremony in her
bedroom. They refused to surrender and attempted to resist arrest,
resulting in the death of a heroic police oﬃcer.
“Finally, Madam Sharon and her accomplice paid the price for their
evil deeds with their lives.”
…
“… Mayor Dennis takes the blame for the worsening public security
in Tingen and resigns. He also announced that he wouldn’t be
running for reelection next year. For the next few months, Deputy
Mayor Mr. Harry will take on the responsibilities of mayor.”
…
A heroic police oﬃcer… Is that the description of Kenley? Klein sighed
and knew that it was the best way of handling the situation.
According to the internal rules of the Nighthawks, in order to prevent
the forces of evil from taking revenge on their family members, their
names would be kept conﬁdential even if they sacriﬁced their lives.
He folded the newspaper quietly and returned it to the reception
desk. Klein suddenly saw a visitor who walked through the entrance.
She was a young lady, in her twenties at most. She was in a ruﬄed
hat and loose dress. She had lovely facial features, blonde hair, green
eyes, and also a depressed yet silent temperament. She was quite a
beauty.
The most eye-catching thing about her was her stomach that bulged
out. She looked like she was more than seven months pregnant.
Klein was stunned, and he felt that he had seen the young pregnant
lady before.
Suddenly, he heard Leonard say in surprise, “Miss Megose?”
Megose… Yes, the young lady who was conned by Lanevus! She’s
pregnant with Lanevus’s child, and as such, there might be something
wrong with her mental health. She says her child sings in her stomach and
also whistles… Klein was suddenly enlightened and he wasn’t
surprised that Leonard knew Megose.
When they relaunched the investigations of people related to
Lanevus, the lady’s photo had been seen by every Nighthawk.
Klein knew her even earlier. Her aunt Christina, whose savings had
been conned by Lanevus, had brought her to the Divination Club to
ask for help. Her aunt even asked if the child in her stomach could be
used for divination.
Then, as Megose heard Leonard’s voice, she looked over at the both
of them vacantly and replied politely, “Hello.”
“Miss Megose, what brings you here to the Blackthorn Security
Company? Do you have anything that you’d like us to do for you?”
Klein took two steps forward and asked.
He was very confused by Megose’s sudden visit. He felt it was an
extreme coincidence.
We just found Lanevus’s letter, and Megose comes visiting?
Megose touched her stomach and smiled faintly.
“Somehow or other, I suddenly thought of coming to Zouteland Street
and suddenly thought of coming up to take a look.”
Her mental health seems to have worsened… Klein recalled that he
hadn’t managed to activate his Spirit Vision and check on Megose’s
situation previously. Hence, he lifted his teeth and was about to tap
his left molars.
Just then, a series of thoughts screamed through his head in
increasing intensity.
“Don’t look!
“Don’t look! Don’t look!
“You’ll die!
“You’ll die if you look!
“You’ll die if you look!”
…
Klein stood rooted on the spot like a statue as his forehead was
covered in cold sweat.
It was like having a deep and heavy nightmare that he nearly
couldn’t wake up from.
Suddenly, he understood something. He had failed to activate his
Spirit Vision the last time because his spirituality had noticed an
unimaginable danger. It slowed him down subconsciously, so he
missed the opportunity and forgot the follow-up.
At that point, Klein had yet to digest the Seer potion entirely, and he
had yet to advance to Sequence 8, so the warnings of spirituality
were very subtle and diﬃcult to notice. But now, Clown’s spiritual
foresight was so clear and obvious!
After nearly twenty seconds, Klein ﬁnally shook oﬀ his paralysis. He
looked sideways at Leonard and realized that the Midnight Poet was
also covered in cold sweat, and his eyes were ﬁlled with horror.
Suddenly, Klein understood what the bomb Lanevus was referring to!
It’s the baby in Megose’s stomach!
It’s the baby that he left behind!
Klein suddenly associated the description in the letter with Hood
Eugen’s answers, and he suddenly remembered something that he
read in Emperor Roselle’s diary.
“I started the Industrial Revolution with my own hands and personally
ushered in the Age of Steam and Machinery, but this will only become the
hotbed for the descent of an Evil God upon this world?”
Klein’s pupils constricted as he thought of a possibility that he
instinctually refused to admit.
No! That’s not right!
The baby in Megose’s stomach can’t be the son of some evil god or an evil
god waiting to descend upon the world!
No! Why would Hood Eugen do such a silly thing! Although his
Psychiatrist power can help Lanevus fool Megose and use her as a
spawning vessel in her semi-unconscious state…
No! The resentment of child laborers that die before their time, and the
factory workers and female workers who live less than ten years aren’t
helping the son of an evil god to grow rapidly!
No!
Y-you may not look directly at God…
Chapter 205: Urgent
Arrangement
Klein instinctively reached for his pockets. He held the Flaring Sun
Charm in one hand and Azik’s copper whistle in the other.
He acutely noticed that the cold, gentle Beyonder feedback of the
latter had vanished as if it was being suppressed by an invisible
power. However, the former was still warm and comforting.
Making use of this comforting feeling, Klein entered a half Cogitation
state. He blocked out his feelings of worry and didn’t leave anything
to chance.
He turned and shot a look at Leonard Mitchell, then tipped his chin
toward Megose.
He then controlled his expression with his Clown abilities and smiled
at Megose.
“Do you want coﬀee, black tea, or nothing at all?”
Megose stroked her stomach as if she was listening to something.
“A cup of warm water. I suddenly thought of chatting with you guys
about Lanevus. I have the feeling that you know a lot.”
“Who told you that?” Leonard was no longer the frivolous guy that
he usually was. His smile had turned rather stiﬀ.
Megose suddenly giggled.
“My child told me. He knows a lot. He’s very smart!”
Klein fought back the urge to curse. He turned to the partition and
signaled to Leonard to keep Megose calm.
Leonard forced a smile and pointed toward the sofa.
“That’s exactly what I’d like to talk about. We want to have a chat
with you about Lanevus.”
Behind the receptionist desk, Rozanne looked on in confusion. She
suddenly realized that she didn’t need to do anything.
Klein quickly made his way past the partition and directly pushed
open the door to Dunn Smith’s oﬃce, then closed the door with a
bang.
He saw Dunn looking shocked before turning serious and saying in a
heavy voice, “Captain, something serious has happened. I know what
Lanevus meant by bomb!”
Dunn stood up and pointed outside.
“Megose?”
He had obviously heard Leonard’s shocked exclamation, but he was
unable to see the looks of fear and cold sweat on his teammates’
faces.
Klein nodded and explained quickly, “I tried to activate my Spirit
Vision to observe Megose to ascertain her mental condition, but my
spirituality stopped me from making the attempt. It kept “warning”
me not to look, that I would die if I did so!
“This made me recall a saying, ‘You may not look directly at God.’
Even if the fetus in Megose’s stomach isn’t an evil god attempting to
descend upon this world, or the spawn of an evil god, it’s deﬁnitely a
legendary creature.
“Captain, connecting this to the black altar in Hood Eugen’s
memories, to his Psychiatrist abilities, to the tragic world as
described in Lanevus’s letter, I think that my guess is quite close to
the truth: Lanevus obtained a ritualistic magic linked to the True
Creator from an Aurora Order member. With Hood Eugen’s help, he
turned Megose into a vessel to gestate a certain power. Then, this
power will make use of the resentment, oppression, and gloominess
surrounding the factories to quickly grow until maturity. In other
words, the ritual itself needs this resentment, oppression, and
gloominess in order to succeed!”
Dunn considered Klein’s words seriously for nearly twenty seconds
before nodding with a solemn expression.
“I’ll ask for assistance from the Holy Cathedral immediately. Let’s
hope that the baby in Megose’s stomach can still wait!
“Of course, we can’t just sit back and do nothing. Tell Leonard to
keep Megose calm and keep her company. Notify Mrs. Orianna,
Rozanne, and the rest. Get all the non-combatants to evacuate!
“I’ll head to the back of Chanis Gate after I send the telegram. We
have to prepare for the worst, which is if Megose’s baby is born
before the arrival of reinforcements from the Holy Cathedral.
“As Captain of the Tingen Nighthawks, I have the authority to use
Saint Selena’s ashes during emergencies!”
Saint Selena’s ashes… The ashes of a High-Sequence Beyonder… The core
seals within Chanis Gate… Klein’s worries eased a little. He quickly
thought of other things.
“Captain, we can also ask for reinforcements from the Mandated
Punishers and the Machinery Hivemind; they should have similar
holy items!”
Klein suddenly had a stroke of inspiration as he muttered to himself,
“Lanevus’s case was originally under the purview of the Mandated
Punishers. Old Neil and I were there to help when one of their senior
members lost control…”
As he spoke softly, his voice grew to a crescendo.
“Captain, can you ask the Mandated Punishers if the member who
lost control was tracking or keeping Megose under surveillance?”
“Are you suspecting that he lost control because he got corrupted by
the baby in Megose’s stomach? They were responsible for Megose
when the investigation was happening…” Dunn answered seriously.
“We cannot delay any further. Go to Mrs. Orianna and the rest. I’ll
take this time to send a telegram to ﬁrst ask for assistance from the
Holy Cathedral, then I’ll inform the Mandated Punishers and the
Machinery Hivemind. Yes, I’ll also have to send a telegram to the
police department and see if they can come up with an excuse to
evacuate the citizens nearby.”
“Alright.” Klein had taken a few steps out of the room when he
suddenly recalled something. He thought about the coincidence of
Megose’s sudden visit.
The image of the building with the red chimney appeared in his
mind. He turned around quickly and said to Dunn, “Captain, one
more thing. Do you remember the coincidences I told you about? The
clue to the Antigonus family’s notebook in the house opposite the
kidnapping, Ray Bieber who didn’t make it out of Tingen in time,
Hanass Vincent exposing himself because of a coincidence, and how a
member of the Aurora Order lost his life because he chanced upon
me, etc.
“All these coincidences are very subtle and hard to detect, but the
fact that Megose suddenly came looking for us right after we
discovered Lanevus’s letter is too obvious and direct. This
coincidence was already laid bare before us, it’s no longer hidden! I
think that the person behind this will soon take center stage!
“Also, why would Madam Sharon take the risk in killing Member of
Parliament Maynard? Is this also a coincidence?”
Dunn thought about it and gave a solemn reply, “I’ll include this
point in the telegram.”
Klein didn’t waste any more time. He exited the oﬃce and went
straight for the accountant’s room on the opposite side.
Mrs. Orianna was preparing the budget for the last three months of
the year. She wanted to complete it in advance just in case the
Captain forgot about it again. When she saw Klein enter, she greeted
him with a smile.
“Lad, what claims do you have to submit today?”
Klein exhaled.
“Mrs. Orianna, we will be on vacation today. Go back home
immediately.”
Orianna froze for a while, looking at the serious face before her in a
daze.
A few seconds later, she stood up in a ﬂuster.
“Alright.”
Klein added in a hurry, “Help me inform the rest of the clerks in the
oﬃce and the armory. I’ll inform Rozanne.”
“Yes!” Orianna didn’t even pack. She grabbed her handbag and
hurried out of the accounting oﬃce.
She turned and stared at Klein after entering the corridor. She drew a
crimson moon near her chest and said, “All of you will be blessed by
the Goddess!”
Thank you… Klein replied in silence. He made his way past the
partition into the receptionist area only to see Leonard chatting with
Megose about Lanevus, his expression rigid.
Klein leaned toward Rozanne as he ﬁlled up a cup of warm water. He
then whispered, “Go home, it’s dangerous here. Come back
tomorrow.”
Rozanne opened her mouth in shock but closed it again after seeing
Klein’s stern expression.
She lowered her head and packed for about ten seconds before
picking up her bag and leaving the receptionist area.
Just as she was walking past Klein, she bit on her lip and whispered,
“To be honest, I respect the Nighthawks as much as I hate other
people who become Beyonders…”
…
After seeing the clerks evacuate the Blackthorn Security Company,
Klein brought warm water to Megose, bent his back, and placed it on
the table in front of her.
“I have something to settle, I’ll be back soon.”
As he stood up, he took the opportunity to lean in towards Leonard’s
ear and whispered, “Keep her here.”
Leonard clenched his teeth and widened his mouth into a grin. He
continued his conversation with Megose and noticed that Megose was
getting a little restless, as though she was losing her focus.
Klein returned to the Captain’s oﬃce, only to realize that Dunn had
already gone underground. There was a telegram on the table. It was
the reply from the Mandated Punishers.
“Yes. We will be there immediately.”
Yes… The Mandated Punisher did lose control because of Megose… Klein
couldn’t calm himself down as he made his way to the corridor. He
didn’t know if he was waiting for the Captain to retrieve the holy
ashes or for reinforcements to arrive.
I wonder if High-Sequence Beyonders can teleport… I don’t think so… He
paced around a few times, suddenly feeling peaceful. He saw that the
gas lamps on both sides of the corridor were now dyed a faint blue.
Amid the darkness, Dunn followed the stairs into the corridor. In his
palm was a square, palm-sized box of ashes.
This box looked as though it was made out of pure silver, but it also
felt like it was human bones. It was carved with many mysterious
patterns. Klein felt colder the closer he was to the box, it was as if the
cold was rapidly seeping into his blood.
Dunn’s face was bathed in an icy blue light. He told Klein, “Go to
Chanis Gate and pick out a Sealed Artifact with the highest oﬀensive
ability. Decide exactly which one with your own judgment. I’ve
already told Seeka and the Keepers inside. Take note of the hidden
threats. Of those, there are three Grade 2 Sealed Artifacts, which
are…”
“Oh, now that I’ve taken out the ashes of Saint Selena, Seeka and the
Keepers cannot leave their positions now.”
At this point, Frye and Royale were both at Kenley’s house for the
funeral preparations. The Archbishop at Saint Selena Cathedral had
gone to the countryside to preach.
“Alright.” Klein didn’t hesitate, immediately turning towards the
basement.
When he was nearing the intersection, Klein suddenly stopped. He
knew that most of the Sealed Artifacts behind Chanis Gate at Tingen
City were Grade 3 and wouldn’t have much of an eﬀect on the baby
in Megose’s stomach. It was, at the very least, a legendary creature.
The Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem might work, but it takes too long to have
an eﬀect. It’s unsuitable for this… There are only three Grade 2 Sealed
Artifacts in Tingen City, and they’re all very dangerous artifacts that can
easily result in my death… I estimate their powers to be about the same as
my Flaring Sun Charm, so I cannot have too many reservations later. I’ll
use the Flaring Sun Charm without any hesitation! It would deﬁnitely be
as powerful as a Grade 2 Sealed Artifact; after all, it has the power of
divine blood in it… Klein’s mind whirled as he nodded indiscernibly.
He felt for the Flaring Sun Charm and Azik’s copper whistle in his
pocket, but he was surprised to ﬁnd that the sensation of the latter
was back.
Regardless of whether it was useful or not, Klein took out a pen and
paper set that was used for divination and wrote a short message.
“The person who made my fate disharmonious and stole the skull of
your child has appeared. He has arranged for Megose to enter the
Blackthorn Security Company at 36 Zouteland Street. It’s highly
likely that Megose is harboring the son of an evil god.
“The situation is very urgent.”
He put away his pen and folded the piece of paper. Klein took out the
copper whistle at the intersection and blew, then watched the giant
skeleton messenger appear before him.
Chapter 206: Grade 2 Sealed
Artifacts
In the corridor within the deep and serene basement, the nearly four-
meter-tall bone messenger disappeared before Klein’s eyes after
taking the letter.
When all that was left of the surroundings were the classic gas lamps
embedded in the walls, he put away Azik’s copper whistle and
walked towards Chanis Gate.
As he was writing the letter, he had already decided on which Sealed
Artifact to pick.
Firstly, it would be almost impossible for the Grade 3 three Sealed
Artifacts to have any eﬀect on the baby in Megose’s stomach. Unless
it was an item like the Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem which had
hidden powers.
But, at that very moment, in such a situation, Klein wasn’t in the
mood to explore or research a secret that might or might not exist.
Plus, most Sealed Artifacts would carry a certain level of danger for
the user. So, Klein eliminated the Grade 3 Sealed Artifacts that would
weaken the user without aﬀecting the enemy.
Secondly, the Tingen Nighthawks didn’t have any Grade 1 Sealed
Artifacts and only three Grade 2 artifacts. That was originally a secret
that Klein wasn’t allowed to know, but due to the urgency of the
situation, Dunn made use of an emergency clause and told him the
general situation.
Dunn Smith couldn’t hold any other Sealed Artifacts at the same time
while holding Saint Selena’s ashes.
And behind the Tingen City’s Chanis Gate, there were three Grade 2
Sealed Artifacts: 2-030, 2-078, and 2-105.
The name of 2- 030 was “Inexhaustible Poison.” It originated from a
Beyonder with an unknown Sequence name who suddenly went mad
and cut his wrist to commit suicide. He let his blood ﬂow into an
ordinary silver cup. But when his blood ran dry, the silver cup wasn’t
ﬁlled, and the liquid in the cup became crystal-clear and alluring. It
was a temptation that even a Sequence 5 Beyonder had failed to
resist. After he drank the liquid, he died of poisoning on the spot.
After the person died, the poison seeped out through his pores and
pooled together again. Its volume was the same as before he drank it.
Not one bit less.
Dunn said that the researchers in the Holy Cathedral suspected that
the poison could kill a High-Sequence Beyonder. However, the
question lay within the fact that it was almost impossible for a High-
Sequence Beyonder to be tempted to drink it. Furthermore, the traits
of 2-030 were obvious, so no one would consume it by accident. If
one wanted to poison them, they had to ﬁrst capture them, seize
control of them, and then force it down their throat. But then, why
go through the trouble?
2-030 would constantly tempt the living things around it to drink it.
The user had to be fully focused on resisting its power. Any slight
negligence would make one drink the poison as though it was only
natural to do so.
When Dunn ﬁnished his description, Klein decided, almost instantly,
to not pick that Sealed Artifact.
The name of 2-078 was “Door of Death.” Its appearance was like a
normal wooden door. Any living thing that passed through it would
die instantly. No High-Sequence Beyonder had ever participated in
the test.
It possessed living traits and constantly attempted to escape. It could
change its appearance and disguise itself into pre-existing doors. If
the user made any mistakes, he would lose control of it. Then, he
would need to be careful and not pass through any door near him. He
would have to try to wait at the original spot for help or break
through a wall to escape.
Klein thought of using 2-078, but after reevaluating the latter two, he
felt that the intuition of a legendary creature would be very sharp
and would be able to diﬀerentiate whichever door was the Door of
Death.
In the end, he decided to pick 2-105.
The name of the Sealed Artifact was “Blood Vessel Thief.” It looked
like a thick, stiﬀened blood vessel. Anyone who touched it, regardless
of whether they were protected or not, would have their life stolen.
In the beginning, it wouldn’t be obvious. But, if one didn’t break
contact with it, the eﬀects would be visible half an hour later. Dunn
said that a Sequence 5 heretic held onto it for two hours. He turned
from a brawny man in his thirties into a hunched old man who had
loose skin, thin white hair, and missing teeth.
The most important trait of 2-105 was that the person wearing it
would have the chance to steal an ability from a target within a
speciﬁc range. Even High-Sequence Beyonders could be robbed of
their abilities, but the probability was smaller.
Within a ten-minute time period, the person who was robbed would
lose the corresponding ability while the person who wore the item
would be able to use the ability skillfully. Ten minutes later, the
ability would vanish, and the person who was robbed would need to
wait a couple of days to recover.
Regardless of whether it works or not, it will at least raise the probability
of success from ﬁve percent to ten percent. I’m the King of Yellow and
Black who wields good luck, after all… Besides, our main goal is just to
take precautions and make preparations to deal with the worst case
scenario. We won’t necessarily have to take action… Hopefully,
reinforcements will arrive soon… Klein stopped outside the duty room,
showing no signs of hesitation anymore.
About the negative eﬀects of Sealed Artifact 2-105, he wasn’t worried
because he wasn’t planning to use the artifact himself…
His plan was to give it to Leonard, as he already had the Flaring Sun
Charm and Azik’s copper whistle who he had no idea if it would still
be suppressed.
My dear Poet, it’s time for you to show your true secret… Klein muttered
and saw Seeka Tron standing by the duty room.
With her white hair and black eyes, the part-time author remained
silent for a few seconds before saying, “Why don’t you guard Chanis
Gate? I’m stronger and more experienced than you.”
But you don’t have Flaring Sun Charms… Klein replied with a smile,
“Madam, I’m already a Sequence 8.
“It wouldn’t be safe here either. There are many Sealed Artifacts that
possess living traits that are itching to take action. Well, if we fail,
the people here will deﬁnitely not survive.
“Heh heh, our goal upstairs is to buy time and wait for
reinforcements. It might be safer than being around Chanis Gate.”
Seeka Tron puckered her lips slowly and drew a crimson moon on her
chest.
“May the Goddess bless all of you.”
As Dunn didn’t have the time to write the document in time, Klein
couldn’t enter Chanis Gate directly. All he did was watch Seeka Tron
push open a tiny crack and enter.
After a few minutes, she appeared by the door, and she was holding a
thick, blood-tainted, pale blood vessel in her left hand.
Klein extended his hand to take it, and he immediately felt a faint
current surging in his body.
…
In the reception hall of the Blackthorn Security Company.
Leonard had already shaken oﬀ his stiﬀ state from earlier, and his
expression didn’t look abnormal as he talked about the recently
discovered house that Lanevus rented before.
“Is that so? He never told me about it before…” Megose replied
normally, creasing her eyebrows slightly.
Then, she grabbed her blonde hair, pulled out a handful, and casually
threw it into the trashcan by the side.
Leonard was dumbfounded. He gulped with diﬃculty, and his palms
were full of cold sweat once again.
…
Klein walked up the stairs to the second ﬂoor with the Blood Vessel
Thief in his left hand.
He looked at the door that led to the Nighthawks break room, where
Dunn Smith stood silently in his black windbreaker. His eyes were
gray and deep, just like when they had ﬁrst met.
“Reintroducing myself, Nighthawk, Dunn Smith.”
The voice of the past sounded in Klein’s ears as the scene of Dunn by
Kenley’s corpse ﬂashed in his head. There was blood all over his
mouth.
He suddenly fell silent and walked over. He lifted his left hand and
said, “Captain, I picked Sealed Artifact 2-105. I plan on letting
Leonard use it.”
Dunn nodded slightly. He didn’t ask why but turned and pointed at
his oﬃce as he spoke.
“The Holy Cathedral sent a telegram. They said that they’ll gather a
team of strong Beyonders immediately and asked us to stall for as
much time as possible and try to wait.
“About those coincidences, they didn’t give any reply. I think they
don’t have any conclusions as of yet. Or perhaps, the person who
handles the telegrams doesn’t know the actual situation and has no
way to make guesses. You know, we have to make the best use of
time. Telegrams can’t be too long.”
“Yes.” Klein nodded. He got closer to the partition and looked outside
as he said, “How’s the situation?”
“Nothing strange as of yet.” Dunn looked down at the Saint’s ash box
in his left hand.
Seeing how Leonard and Megose were having a good time chatting,
Klein didn’t interrupt them. He retreated to the Nighthawks’
recreation room and faced Dunn with the corridor in between them.
Just then, Dunn suddenly let out a self-deprecating laugh.
“I forgot something.”
“What is it?” Klein replied, puzzled.
Dunn looked sideways at him and said, “Daly told me to explain
myself to you.”
“Huh?” Klein was stunned, as he couldn’t quite understand what the
Captain meant.
After two seconds, before Dunn could reply, he suddenly understood.
Madam Daly didn’t reply immediately because she thought it was
unnecessary. She had forwarded the matter to the Captain and let
him explain himself.
Th-that means that there isn’t anything serious with the Captain!
At this critical point, Klein suddenly felt a surge of joy erupt inside of
him.
Chapter 207: Guardian
Dunn sighed.
“I did want to send you away back then since I was going to do
something that involves the secrets of the Church and the
Nighthawks. But Kenley’s death left my mind in chaos. At that
moment, all I could think of was a clumsy excuse, thus, giving you
the opportunity to witness what I was doing.”
“What secret is that?” Klein pressed, now being more at ease.
He had almost forgotten about the threat of the evil god’s son, or the
existence of a legendary creature outside.
Dunn weighed his words and said, “There might be a law in
mysticism. Heh, even though I haven’t read many books, I’m still
aware of what a law means.
“This law is called ‘Law of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility.’
“The characteristics of a Beyonder is never destroyed or reduced. It’s
only passed from one carrier to the next.”
Klein’s eyes opened wide. He suddenly came to a realization and
asked thoughtfully, “For example, the Sealed Artifacts, mysterious
objects, or a potion’s main ingredients that are left behind by
Beyonders who have lost control?”
“Correct.” Dunn nodded solemnly. “This isn’t only the case for
Beyonders who lose control; it’s also the same for normal Beyonders
after they die.”
“The same…” Klein mulled over Dunn’s description, now having a
faint idea of what the Captain was doing.
He suddenly recalled when the suited clown died. He recalled the
blue, thumb-sized blood sphere that was suspended beside the corpse
of the suited clown. Frye’s explanation had been that there would
always be strange transformations after a Beyonder died.
Dunn continued with his deep gray eyes, “But what’s diﬀerent about
Beyonders who lose control is that a Beyonder who dies normally
won’t leave behind ingredients or objects. Th-they’re equivalent to a
potion, a potion that corresponds to their Sequences, except that
they’re lacking a certain amount of supplementary ingredients.”
Equivalent to potions… Equivalent to potions! Klein squinted as a ﬂash
of inspiration went through his mind. The endless darkness in his
mind was illuminated in that instant.
He suddenly understood many things, ﬁguring out why the Beyonder
pathways wouldn’t be broken, even if the creatures used as main
ingredients were going extinct.
Apart from using substitutes, one could also simply use the remains
of Beyonders!
That should also be the reason why they only handed out complete potions
at the higher Sequences! Another reason is to prevent the formula from
being revealed to people adept at divination or mediumship rituals…
Many guesses went through Klein’s mind.
Dunn looked at the recreation room and explained in a deep voice,
“A few years ago… Well… I can’t exactly remember just exactly how
many years it was, but I wasn’t the Captain of the Nighthawks back
then. I unexpectedly realized this problem, and after interacting with
Daly, who had just become a Beyonder, I immediately sent a report
to the Holy Cathedral. The Holy Cathedral told me to keep it a secret
and gave me two choices. Heh heh, that’s also the reason why it’s me,
and not Daly, who’s explaining this to you. Whoever exposes this is
responsible for it.
“The ﬁrst choice was to pretend to know nothing, just like a large
number of Nighthawk Captains and Deacons, and allow the Holy
Cathedral to continue dealing with the remains of Beyonders who
died through normal means. The second was for them to give me a
unique, simple ritual and the corresponding techniques. It would
allow me to temporarily consume the items produced by the unique
characteristics within a limited period of time. Well, this is only
suitable for Sequences of the same pathway at my level or lower.
“This would augment my Beyonder characteristics, and I would also
become more powerful. In terms of abilities regarding dreams, my
powers now are not too diﬀerent from a Sequence 6’s. That’s also the
reason why I dared to deal with Madam Sharon.”
“So that’s why… To think that something like this exists…” Klein
slowly exhaled.
He ﬁnally understood why he couldn’t come up with a logical
explanation despite his best eﬀorts. That was because he didn’t have
all the relevant information and was unable to ﬁll in the blanks.
Yes, this does match the Law of Beyonder Characteristics
Indestructibility… Would consuming these characteristics cause a
qualitative change in the Captain by constantly accumulating them? Klein
allowed his mind to wander.
After glancing at him, Dunn let out a bitter smile.
“I chose the second option, but not because I wanted to become more
powerful. If I wanted to become more powerful, quickly digesting a
potion and receiving an advancement is the best and most direct
way.”
“Yes,” Klein agreed sincerely. “Consolidating the characteristics of
the potions of the same Sequence will increase the risk of losing
control at the same time as it improves your abilities, right?”
Dunn shook his head solemnly. “No, these are the remains of normal
Beyonders and not Beyonders who have lost control. Well, after I
came to know of the acting method, I realized that it would increase
the diﬃculty of digesting the potion.”
“Then why do you still continue?” Klein asked in shock.
Dunn placed his hand into his pocket, intending to take out his pipe,
only to ﬁnd that he had left it in his oﬃce.
He shook his head and let out a self-deprecating smile.
“I just said that becoming more powerful isn’t the reason why I
consume their remains.”
Having said that, he paused, his eyes wandering to the blue ﬂicker of
the gas lamp opposite where he was standing.
“They were all my partners… We’ve gone through many things
together. We’ve dealt with monsters in the darkness and insane
heretics together. Some of them have saved me, and I’ve saved quite
a number of them. We walked together in the silent night. We fought
together in battles that aren’t visible to the general public. We faced
danger together. We had each other’s backs.
“I really can’t bear to part with them. I remember the lad, Hitte. He
broke into tears the ﬁrst time we went on a dangerous mission. I
remember Adelaide, heh—he was Rozanne’s father. He once blocked
an evil curse for me with his arm. I remember the lady, Dwayne, and
her warm temperament which was like the dawn. She would always
silently record the things we encountered. I remember Kenley being
someone who knew how to do many things like play the seven-string
guitar, sing, tell stories, even though he wasn’t tall. He was more like
a poet than Leonard… I miss them very much.
“I hoped to continue ﬁghting with them, to continue dealing with the
monsters in the darkness, to deal with the crazy heretics, to protect
Tingen City with them. Thus, I chose to consume their remains.”
Dunn’s gray eyes seemed to ﬂicker. His reliable and dependable
persona broke down considerably at that moment.
His lips arched upward slightly as he continued, “They’re still with
me in my dreams. Adelaide loves to read, and he often reads at the
solarium. He often tells me to discipline Rozanne and get her to
mature faster, to the point that Rozanne complains about me
becoming more and more like her father and has become scared of
me. Hitte is a person who cannot sit still and has to hunt in the forest
every day. Dwayne always stands by the window of her bedroom and
watches us chat. Kenley, who recently joined, created his own seven-
string guitar and sings while strumming it… I really miss them.”
“Captain…” Klein subconsciously muttered. His eyes became blurred
and watery. He couldn’t help but rub his eyes and curse in his heart.
Fuck. Captain, you’re making me cry…
But I ﬁnally understand the reason for the Captain’s slow progress despite
using the “acting method”… Klein let out a silent sigh.
“Unfortunately, Old Neil died after losing control. Otherwise, he
would’ve brought along much joy to us.” Dunn retracted his gaze. He
lowered his head and massaged the bridge of his nose.
A few seconds later, he lifted his head and let out a bitter smile.
“This is a selﬁsh decision.
“I don’t know what the true wishes of Adelaide, Kenley, and the rest
were, and, thus, selﬁshly made a decision for them.
“I truly am a selﬁsh person.”
“No…” Klein shook his head.
…
On the sofa in the receptionist area, Leonard watched Megose pull
out clumps of her hair as his expression became more and more rigid.
Megose seemed increasingly restless as she constantly picked up the
glass for a mouthful of water. She looked at Leonard with a contorted
expression.
“I don’t know why, but I suddenly feel a little unwell.”
Leonard Mitchell was about to reply when he suddenly saw Megose
reach for her face. She clawed out a piece of ﬂesh—a long piece of
ﬂesh—a piece of ﬂesh stained with blood.
“My face is a little itchy.” Megose smiled, a little embarrassed. The
edge of her lips spread to where her cheekbones were, revealing a
row of white teeth and bright red gums.
FUCK! Leonard cursed out silently. He felt that the situation was
worsening way too quickly.
His lips quivering, Leonard turned to listen as his expression
immediately turned steely green.
He forced a smile and apologized to Megose, who was clawing out
pieces of her ﬂesh.
“I need to use the bathroom.”
“Al… right…” Megose’s tone became ethereal.
She rubbed her belly and said, “My… child… is a little restless…”
Leonard didn’t reply. He hastened his footsteps and approached the
partition.
After entering the corridor, Leonard stared deeply at the box of ash in
Dunn Smith’s hands and exhaled in exasperation.
Following that, his expression turned ﬁrm.
“Captain, I’m afraid that it’s too late. We have to deal with Megose
and her baby immediately. Otherwise, the whole of Tingen will suﬀer
terrible losses. This isn’t something that can be avoided just by
evacuating the citizens around us. I know that you’ve already sent
such a telegram.”
Dunn knitted his eyebrows and asked, unusually stern, “Are you sure
that the situation has worsened to such an extent?”
“Yes. In no more than three minutes, Megose will undergo a
mutation, and her child will descend upon us,” Leonard said with a
certain tone.
At the same time, he glanced at the thick, large blood vessel wrapped
around Klein’s hand and said, “Sealed Artifact 2-105? Let me use it. I
can better utilize its abilities.”
“Alright.” Klein didn’t hesitate to hand the Blood Vessel Thief over to
Leonard.
That was something he intended to do so from the beginning.
At that moment, Dunn tugged at his collar and patted down his
windbreaker. He spoke with a determined tone, “I’ll head out with
Saint Selena’s ashes ﬁrst. Come out after ten seconds; remember,
come out only after you ﬁnish counting to ten. Then, regardless of
my condition, direct your strongest attacks at Megose and her baby
without wasting any time.”
With that said, he turned around and walked towards the partition
with the urn of ashes.
“Captain…” Klein let out a shout, his lips dry.
“Captain!” Leonard also shouted.
Dunn stopped and looked back. He had a gentle expression as he said
with his mellow voice, “Don’t worry about me. I’m not alone.
Adelaide, Dwayne, Hitte, and Kenley are all ﬁghting alongside me, no
matter what kind of danger I face.”
He paused for a moment before speaking, his gray eyes gentle.
“There’s no need to be too nervous as well. We’re guarding Tingen
City.”
His lips arched upwards, forming his usual smile.
After saying those words, he didn’t stay any longer. He stepped
through the partition, his black windbreaker following behind him.
“Captain!” Klein and Leonard shouted at the same time, their tears
falling uncontrollably, but Dunn didn’t slow down.
We are guardians, but also a bunch of miserable wretches that are
constantly ﬁghting against threats and madness.
Chapter 208: Cry
Beep! Beep! Beep! The telegram set up in the Captain’s oﬃce suddenly
came to life, seemingly having received a new telegram.
But Klein and Leonard couldn’t be distracted. They were counting the
movements of the second hand on the clock as their red eyes welled
up with tears.
“10.”
“9.”
“8.”
…
Just then, Dunn Smith carried the silver, bone-like square box into
the reception hall with a solemn expression.
Megose, who was pulling out clump after clump of blond hair, tore a
wound that was deep enough to show her bones. It was as though she
was triggered by something. She suddenly stood and pointed at Dunn
Smith in his black windbreaker. She shrieked, “You want to kill my
child!
“You want to kill my child!”
Boom! The shrill and terrifying voice reverberated. Klein felt like he
was being struck in the head with a sledgehammer. He suddenly
forgot to count as he had a headache and felt dizzy.
His vision went red, and there seemed to be liquid ﬂowing from the
tip of his nose.
He subconsciously looked sideways, and he saw the corner of
Leonard Mitchell’s eyes. The tip of his nose and the corners of his lips
were covered in fresh blood. His face was extremely pale, and his
body was wavering as though he was about to fall.
I’m probably in the same state… Klein reined back his thoughts and
continued to count in silence as he skipped two numbers.
“5.”
“4.”
…
Struck by the terrifyingly sharp voice, Dunn Smith’s deep gray eyes
were ﬁlled with red veins. Every single strand was crystal clear.
The blood vessels in his face protruded out as well; every one of them
like a poisonous snake. There was also a gurgle as red liquid ﬂowed
out of his ears as well.
Despite that, he did feel dizzy. Other than his right hand pausing, his
strong willpower drove him to press down on Saint Selena’s urn and
open the lid.
Inside the box, there was deep darkness. In the darkness, there was
ﬁne resplendent sand. The scene was magically beautiful, just like a
starry night being stored in a box.
The surroundings suddenly became dark, and the darkness engulfed
the entire reception hall. In the air, there were countless black, cold,
and smooth threads were ﬂoating.
They surged towards Megose and entangled her almost instantly.
It wasn’t like a spider web, but more like the tentacles of some
unknown creature!
Megose had already torn out her right eyeball. It hung by a thin cord
of ﬂesh underneath her eye socket. She stared at Dunn Smith with
hatred as she roared, “You must die!”
Bang! Dunn was cast away by a formless force and slammed heavily
into the wall opposite. The wall cracked, and bricks were thrown up.
He spat a mouthful of fresh blood onto the ground, but both his
hands were still tightly holding onto Saint Selena’s urn. He held onto
it for dear life and kept it from falling to the ground.
Those countless black, cold, and smooth threads tightened and bound
Megose ﬁrmly to the spot. No matter how much blight-tainted ﬂames
rose up suddenly, or how her skin began to secrete a liquid that smelt
like brimstone, neither of those defenses dealt any damage to the
threads holding onto her.
“3!”
“2!”
“1!”
Klein and Leonard dashed out through the partition simultaneously.
One of them was holding onto a warm thin gold slice, and the other
had already aimed his ﬁve ﬁngers with the Blood Vessel Thief wound
around his left wrist at Megose.
Megose, who no longer looked human, struggled as ﬂesh protruded
from both sides of her shoulders. They were a mixture of blood
vessels and green veins, round like a child’s head.
Above the two heads, cracks rapidly spread and seemingly turned
into a pair of eyes.
Megose suddenly noticed danger approaching, and she opened her
mouth. The corner of her lips cracked all the way up to her ears.
She was going to deal the Blaspheme Curse to every enemy that
attempted to harm her child!
At that moment, Leonard clenched his left hand into a ﬁst as his wrist
made a half turn.
His pale face turned livid, and the vessels protruded like bunch of
tiny poisonous worms.
“…” Megose’s Blaspheme Curse was left stuck in her throat as it came
to a sudden halt.
She seemed to have lost the ability to speak and the ability to evoke
curses.
Klein seized the opportunity and muttered an ancient Hermes word
in a deep voice.
“Light!”
I want light, and there will be light!
He suddenly felt the thin gold slice that was covered in mysterious
patterns become boiling hot as he saw it emit a blinding light, as
though it had become a miniature sun.
Right on the heels of that, Klein injected more than half his
spirituality into it and threw the Flaring Sun Charm towards the
restrained Megose!
The reception hall instantly turned transparent as darkness and
gloominess vanished simultaneously. The black ﬁne threads that
entangled Megose shrank as though they were instinctively avoiding
something.
But before Megose obtained her freedom, she already saw the
sunlight.
At some point in the ﬁght, a hole had ruptured in the ceiling of the
Blackthorn Security Company, and the hole went all the way to the
rooftop of the third ﬂoor. The bright blue sky and glaring sunlight
shined through simultaneously.
The thin gold slice combined with the sunlight above Megose’s and
immediately expanded in size. It went from a spherical light to a
sphere with countless ﬂames spiraling around it.
Rumble!
The entire building shook vigorously, and the glass windows on the
nearby streets shattered.
However, the power of the spherical light concentrated its might at
its core, without dissipating much.
It enveloped Megose, and the light was so glaring that Klein, Dunn,
and Leonard couldn’t open their eyes.
Klein held back his tears and looked through squinted eyes. He saw
that the light had dispersed, but the ﬂames were still soaring. Among
them, there were many black ashes dancing in the air.
Megose and the baby in her stomach were nowhere to be seen. Just
like the coﬀee table, water glass, newspaper, and sofa in the area.
Is it over? Did we ﬁnish the son of an evil god before it descended upon
this world, taking “His” mother out at the same time? Klein still couldn’t
believe it.
His experience of playing video games told him that the ﬁnal boss
couldn’t be taken care of so easily!
Suddenly, he felt goosebumps all over. His Clown instincts told him
that there was extreme danger approaching!
Without thinking, Klein rolled to the left abruptly.
Just then, a long arm with an extremely sharp white bone blade
cleaved the spot, seemingly out of nowhere. The monstrosity had an
abnormal beauty, and it ﬂoated in mid-air. It was unbelievably fast
and almost impossible to dodge its attacks.
Whoosh!
Klein’s clothing on the right side of his chest was ripped apart, his
skin ruptured, and his ﬂesh, along with his bones, was split into two!
The wound was so deep that he could almost see one of his lungs.
If it wasn’t because he sensed danger approaching beforehand and
dodged in time, that slash would’ve sliced him in half.
But, even so, Klein slowed down. Extreme pain ﬁlled his head and
scattered his consciousness.
At the end of the white bone blade, a ﬁgure rapidly ﬂew out. If it
wasn’t for the bump on its stomach, perhaps no one could identify it
as Megose.
Her hair and dress had been burned entirely. The skin on her face
and body was charred black and was peeling oﬀ, ﬂake after ﬂake.
Her nose had melted, leaving only two small black holes behind. Her
eyeballs were nowhere to be seen, and there were faint white ﬂames
dancing in the empty sockets.
The two “heads” that had popped up from both sides of Megose’s
shoulders had been burned away. Her left arm had become the white
bone blade that she was holding; it looked demonic, yet holy.
Creak!
As the ground shook, Megose ignored Dunn and Leonard, as well as
the black, cold, and smooth ﬁne threads that were hurtling towards
her again. She phased over to Klein who had come to a stop after
rolling away. She aimed the white bone blade at Klein’s neck and was
about to slash down.
Suddenly, she heard a voice that contained a rich blasphemous tone.
“Submit!”
Leonard lifted his left hand and aimed his palm at Megose. The
Sealed Artifact 2-105 wrapped around his wrist had turned from a
thick pale, blood-tainted blood vessel into a crimson “intestine” that
had expanded to the point that it looked ready to explode.
With the aid of the Blood Vessel Thief, Leonard had successfully
stolen Megose’s Blaspheme Curse and was attempting to use her
power to seize control of her!
Only an ability at her level was eﬀective!
Under the inﬂuence of the Blaspheme Curse, Megose bent her waist,
and her knees were constantly trembling. Her motions came to a halt
as the surrounding black threads surrounded her as though they had
found a delicious prey. Klein also took the opportunity to roll in the
opposite direction, leaving a trail of fresh crimson blood behind him.
However, he got some reprieve from his extreme pain and reached
his hand into his pocket. He took out the last Flaring Sun Charm.
He took the opportunity when Megose was stationary to ﬁnish her
oﬀ, once and for all!
If she were to hold out until the “baby” was born, the outcome would
be beyond their imagination!
Boom!
Megose’s head exploded on its own. Her charred skin and ﬂesh ﬂew
in all directions.
But her headless body seized the opportunity to shake oﬀ the eﬀect of
the Blaspheme Curse!
Boom! Megose’s charred body transformed into a projectile that shot
towards Leonard. Since the Blaspheme Curse had been forcefully
disrupted, Leonard was temporarily frozen on the spot.
At that moment, Dunn Smith was still holding onto Saint Selena’s urn
tightly. His face was abnormally pale, and the black, cold threads
that were created was still short of surrounding Megose.
Creak!
Megose slammed into Leonard, throwing him to the wall. The wall
collapsed from the impact.
Leonard’s bones cracked, and there was blood spewing out from his
mouth incessantly. Without even having the urge to struggle, he
fainted instantly.
Megose raised her white bone blade, but the countless black threads
that emanated from Saint Selena’s urn enveloped her again and was
about to bind her to the ground.
Without the luxury of time to mind his injuries, Klein quickly took
out the thin charm.
Just as he was going to recite the ancient Hermes incantation,
something suddenly sounded in the deep, dark, yet quiet room.
“Waaa!”
It was the cry of a baby.
Chapter 209: Light
“Waaa!”
The baby in Megose’s stomach cried. It squirmed, wanting to come
into this world in a bid to help its mother escape from her
predicament.
The black, cold, and smooth threads appeared to suﬀer a shock as
they seemed to be suppressed by an invisible power which led to
their retreat backward.
“Waaa!”
Dunn and Klein became dizzy at the same time. They felt their
throats contract involuntarily as their contracting air passages
instantly stiﬂed them.
Crimson liquid ﬂowed from their nostrils, their eyes, and their ears.
All of their capillaries seemed to have ruptured.
If it wasn’t for the fact that Klein had undergone the torture of
hearing the mutterings and ravings every time he headed to the
world above the gray fog, as well as Dunn holding onto the ashes of
Saint Selena, they deﬁnitely would’ve fainted on the spot, just like
Leonard Mitchell.
Megose’s headless body turned over and looked at Klein who saw her
charred skin and ﬂesh peeling to the ground, and the holy, yet evil
white bone blade.
Having escaped its inﬂuence thanks to his rich experience, Klein
immediately felt his scalp tingle and forgot about the pain in his right
chest. He seemed to witness his enemy charge towards him
maniacally, not giving him any time to recite the incantation, infuse
spirituality, and throw out the Flaring Sun Charm.
Just as he was about to dodge the attack, Klein saw Megose suddenly
pause. He saw Dunn Smith’s black windbreaker ﬂuttering, and the
Captain diagonally across him had buried his head. There were
multiple thick twitching objects on his back as if they were venomous
snakes or tentacles—or monsters!
Dunn was using his abilities as a Nightmare to forcefully impede
Megose’s movements.
Bam! Bam! Bam! With a mere struggle from Megose, the thick
tentacle-like objects that protruded from Dunn’s back exploded at the
same time!
A large amount of blood splattered out, covering every corner of the
room like rain.
Dunn wasn’t disappointed at the result, for the blood had been
absorbed by the black threads created by Saint Selena’s ashes.
They had been absorbed!
The countless cold, smooth, tentacle-like threads entered a frenzy.
They swarmed forward and bound Megose tightly, wrapping
themselves around her bulging, squirming stomach.
An opportunity!
Klein was as nervous as he was excited. He prepared to shout the
ancient Hermes word for “Light.”
“Waaa! Waaa! Waaa!”
The cries of a baby could be heard once again, more frequent, and
more incessant this time around!
The countless black threads suddenly came to a pause, retreating and
trembling again as if they had all been struck by lightning.
Dunn’s expression changed when he realized that Megose was about
to free herself. Without hesitation, he retracted his right palm,
formed a claw, and stabbed it into his own chest—his left chest!
He quickly pulled out his right hand, his ﬁngers holding a bloody
heart tightly. It was a still-beating heart that brought with it the
sereneness of the night and a dream.
Captain… Klein watched helplessly as Dunn Smith stuﬀed the heart
into the urn containing Saint Selena’s ashes. His vision quickly
blurred.
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Crying that sounded like a late-night nightmare resounded. The
countless cold and serene threads once again resumed their eﬀorts as
they wrapped themselves tightly around Megose!
This time, they didn’t loosen their bindings despite the cries coming
from the baby in Megose’s stomach. In fact, they even sealed the
terrifying sounds within the body!
Klein’s tears fell together with his blood. He uttered a simple Hermes
term in a deep voice, “Light!”
The light that illuminates the darkness! The light that brings warmth!
He infused almost all of his remaining spirituality into the thin gold
piece etched with mysterious symbols, causing his mind to
immediately turn blank and dizzy.
Having mustered the last of his strength, Klein tossed out the Flaring
Sun Charm at Megose, who was still bound by the countless black
threads.
The black threads didn’t retract this time, having not followed their
instincts, as if they were being willed by someone.
Thump! Thump!
Dunn’s fresh heart was still beating within the box containing Saint
Selena’s ashes.
The sunlight once again shone in from the hole in the ceiling, shining
through all three stories, right into the Blackthorn Security Company,
as if it were a corporeal pillar.
It was guided here by the Flaring Sun Charm, and it was focused on
Megose.
The sunlight fused with the top of the headless monster, and then
exploded like the sun!
Rumble!
In the burning white splendor, Klein closed his eyes. This last scene
was etched deep into his mind.
Megose’s body lost its left arm, head, and multiple pieces of ﬂesh. Its
charred body crumbled instantly. The half-illusory, terrifying creature
within her body no longer had the support of a physical body and
couldn’t complete the last stage of its transformation. It turned into a
furious ball of black gas, dissolving amidst the light and ﬂames.
Rumble!
The entire building shook violently, but this was only due to the
released energy of the Flaring Sun Charm.
The charm was diﬀerent from a normal bomb. Its powers were
concentrated, yet restrained!
Klein fought to stabilize his body. He opened his eyes and looked
ahead a few seconds later.
He saw that the walls had crumbled. He saw a charred circle where
Megose once stood. Surprisingly, the ﬂoor had only melted slightly.
He saw a burned, bloody placenta on the ground. He saw Dunn Smith
standing on the spot, still wearing his black windbreaker. He saw the
heart in the box of Saint Selena’s ashes still beating slowly. He saw
Leonard Mitchell lying on the opposite side; his outcome was
unknown.
The exhausted Klein felt elated and felt that he could still use
ritualistic magic to save the Captain. He felt that Megose and her
baby were truly ﬁnished. No—it was more accurate to say that the
latter had suﬀered an interruption and was exorcised.
At that moment, Dunn Smith turned to look at Klein. His pale face
had a warm and relaxed expression, and his voice still as mellow as it
usually was.
“We saved Tingen.”
After saying this, it was as if he had returned to the time when he
was twenty. He no longer appeared stern and serious as he winked at
Klein with his left eye.
Klein’s expression froze. He saw the heart in the box of Saint’s
Selena’s ashes stop beating. It turned into a resplendent ball of light
before scattering into the surroundings. He saw the captain fall
backward, his arms losing their strength.
It felt like the scene was made up of a series of paintings, but Klein
could do nothing to stop it.
Thump!
The box of Saint Selena’s ashes fell onto the ground, just like Klein’s
heart.
Thud! Thud! Even though the box wasn’t covered, the darkness within
the box sealed the opening, preventing the resplendent sand-like
ashes from falling out. The box rolled a distance away towards Klein.
Dunn Smith fell to the wrecked ﬂoor, his deep gray eyes having lost
all their luster. He was looking at the hole in the ceiling, the sunlight
pouring down on his face.
Captain! Klein’s vision blurred once again. He wanted to shout, but
that word and the subsequence words were stuck in his throat.
We miss you too…
At that moment, the box containing Saint Selena’s ashes had rolled to
his feet.
Suddenly, Klein felt a pain in his chest, his pupils violently
constricted as he froze in place.
He looked down to see a slightly pale palm, drenched in blood,
coming out the left side of his chest.
Megose isn’t dead… No, a new enemy… The mastermind behind the
scenes… Am I going to die?
Klein quickly lost his consciousness, his eyes almost losing focus. His
body slumped to the side.
His breathing gradually slowed and, he ﬁnally felt the palm pull back
quickly. He saw a pair of brand new leather boots, and a hand
reaching downward, a slightly pale hand.
It grabbed the urn of Saint Selena’s ashes.
Klein’s vision went black, and he lost all consciousness.
…
Burned and shattered objects were scattered around in the now
destroyed Blackthorn Security Company, but there wasn’t a single
sound, it was just like a cemetery.
A few minutes later, Leonard Mitchell’s body moved, his eyes
opening slowly.
He propped himself up with diﬃculty and surveyed the surroundings.
He saw Dunn Smith on the ground. He also saw Klein who had his
eyes staring wide as a look of shock was plastered across his face.
Dunn and Klein both had visible wounds on the left sides of their
chests.
No… Leonard squeezed out the word from his throat as he staggered
towards Klein’s corpse, that wasn’t far away from Dunn.
He kept checking them, going between the two repeatedly, but all he
could do was accept this irreversible truth.
Leonard’s knees buckled as his knees plopped to the ground. His
green eyes were ﬁlled with pain as tears streamed down his cheeks,
washing away the blood and dust.
He turned his head and listened for two seconds and suddenly
sprawled forward. He let out an angry roar and clenched his palms
into ﬁsts, and heavily pounded the ﬂoor.
Thump! Thump! Thump!
Leonard kept tearing up as he pounded the ﬂoor. Amidst his sorrow
was a feeling of clear hatred and a clear sense of self-abhorrence.
Thud! Thud! Thud! Leonard looked up when he heard the sounds of
hurried footsteps and saw the members of the Mandated Punishers
and the Machinery Hivemind that had just arrived at the scene
through his blurred vision.
Chapter 210: Story
In a Tingen suburb, there was a house with a green lawn.
The house had a garden that had begun to wither at the beginning of
September. Attached to the house was a crimson chimney.
There was a desk next to the window in the bedroom of that house.
An ordinary notebook was spread open on the table.
A slightly pale hand ﬂipped the notebook to the very ﬁrst page, then
it quickly ﬂipped to the back.
As the paper ﬂipped, the rows of words appeared faintly.
Regence, a member from the Secret Order, sold the Antigonus
family’s notebook as an ordinary ancient book by accident due to the
inﬂuence both of weariness and illusions. It was a coincidence that
made logical sense.
Aﬀected by the calling of the Antigonus family’s bloodline, the
notebook secretly aﬀects its owners, one after the other. After
repeated changes in ownership, it came to Tingen. It fell into the
hands of the members of the Aurora Order—Sirius Arapis and Hanass
Vincent.
After they ﬂipped through the content that temporarily appeared in
the notebook and copied the corresponding potion formulas, Sirius
and Hanass were worried that the Secret Order, who were good at
divination, would track them down. After discussing it, they decided
to avoid the risk by selling it to another person.
They didn’t wait for Mr. Z’s reply; perhaps because he stayed at
Enmat Harbor.
Through Sirius’s introduction, Hanass got to know Welch McGovern
from the Khoy University’s Department of History. Then, Hanass sold
the Antigonus family’s notebook to McGovern as an ordinary ancient
book.
Subsequently, Sirius was attracted by the treasure that was said to
exist on the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range. He started to
visit the Deweyville Library and research the mountain. He didn’t
think that there would be any problems, so he left his real address
and name. That aligned with his personality.
During this process, he acquainted himself with Lanevus, who was
reading up on information about iron mines to set up a scam.
Lanevus’s hidden lunacy and swindling ability were well appreciated
by Sirius. He decided to nurture him into a member of the Aurora
Order. Of course, before that, an investigation was inevitable.
Sirius covertly informed Lanevus about the evil ritual of praying to
the True Creator to deliver “His” spawn into this world. But he knew
that the possibility of Lanevus succeeding was very low, because the
diﬃculty level of the ritual was very high, and the requirements were
very harsh. However, the latter expressed his strong interest in the
matter, tempted by the possibility of obtaining a deity’s approval. He
planned to complete the ritual simultaneously as he carried out the
plans of establishing his steelworks company.
The cunning Lanevus could tell that there was something ﬁshy about
Sirius Arapis. But for his personal goal, he didn’t expose him.
He visited Hood Eugen in the asylum once again. They had known
each other long ago, and they knew about their respective situations.
After a dark divination, the Antigonus family’s notebook was
awakened fully. Welch and his classmate died. The lucky survivor,
Klein Moretti, sent it to Ray Bieber’s house under the inﬂuence of the
notebook. It was a destined ending.
Many rows were scribbled oﬀ and new content followed.
For some baﬄing reason, and a lack of suﬃcient explanations, Klein
didn’t commit suicide after that and somehow managed to stay alive.
In the Nighthawks’ investigation of Welch’s case that followed, he
met Dunn Smith and joined the Nighthawks.
Although it had already exceeded Ince Zangwill’s description, it
didn’t aﬀect the development of the story.
Bacchus and his brothers were down on their luck. They lost their
last chip at the gambling tables and were drowning in debt. In a bid
to obtain money, they decided to kidnap and blackmail the somewhat
wealthy individuals.
When they were looking for their ﬁnal hideout, they chanced upon
the room opposite Ray Bieber’s apartment.
By then, Ray Bieber was already seduced by the power oﬀered by the
Antigonus family’s notebook. He hoped to digest the gift left behind
by his ancestors.
However, he was in a semi-insane state, and he couldn’t make the
best and safest choice. He abandoned his dead mother, but he
continued remaining in Tingen City. He only found a more elusive
spot to carry out his digestion ritual. It was truly pathetic. If he had
been slightly smarter, the story could’ve become even more
complicated, but his decision was made based on his instincts and his
poor state of mind.
Bacchus and company purchased weapons and took the youngest son,
Elliott, of the tobacco merchant, Vickroy, and held him for ransom.
Finally, they successfully carried out the abduction and took Elliot
back to the apartment opposite Ray Bieber’s. Vickroy’s butler was
entrusted with looking for help from a security company.
Because of Welch’s mysterious death, security companies were short
on hands. Klee chanced upon a deliveryman and happened to
discover the existence of the Blackthorn Security Company.
Leonard Mitchell and Klein accepted the job. Relying on their
Beyonder powers, they quickly saved the merchant’s son. Regrettably,
Klein didn’t immediately realize that clues to the Antigonus family’s
notebook were in the apartment opposite them.
However, his spirituality reminded him in his dream. As such, the
Tingen Nighthawks discovered corresponding clues.
…
Sealed Artifact 2-049 arrived in Tingen. With the aid of the
Antigonus family’s puppet, Dunn Smith led the Nighthawks to ﬁnd
Ray Bieber before interrupting his digestion procedure.
Ray Bieber became a monster, and the situation was out of control.
In the end, the Nighthawks skillfully worked together and took care
of Monster Bieber, but they immediately faced the attack of a
member from the Secret Order.
More rows were scribbled away again, and the original content was
impossible to read.
Leonard Mitchell, who possesses a secret, was going to end the
situation. Before he could, Klein, who was supposed to be doomed,
killed the Sequence 7 member from the Secret Order in an
inexplicable manner.
That didn’t aﬀect the development of the story. Dunn Smith got in
touch with the Antigonus family’s notebook and ﬂipped through its
content. From that point onwards, he was secretly tainted!
…
Having ﬁnished with all his preparations, Lanevus beguiled Hood
Eugen and used him to assist in his ritual. They tricked Lanevus’s
ﬁancée, Megose, to become the vessel that would carry the True
Creator’s spawn.
Lanevus had almost no possibility of success. The most serious
problem was that even though Megose would be protected by the
ritual’s power, she wouldn’t be able to withstand the sexual
intercourse with the illusory projection of a deity. It would cost her
her life on the altar.
At that moment, the kind Ince Zangwill helped Lanevus in secret. He
split oﬀ half a piece of a descendant of Death’s characteristic that he
obtained and planted it into Megose’s body ahead of time.
Hood Eugen made Megose enter a semi-unconscious state and
convinced her that the True Creator’s illusory projection was
Lanevus. Nourished by the accumulated resentment, gloominess, and
oppression of the factory district, the ritual succeeded. Megose was
pregnant with the True Creator’s spawn. The deity saw through the
coincidences, but since “He” wished to break through the shackles
placed on him by the seven deities, “He” didn’t refuse.
Hood Eugen was contaminated.
After the ritual succeeded, the mad Lanevus regained his rationality.
He clearly knew that if the deity’s spawn was to descend into the
world, Lanevus, himself, would become one of the sacriﬁcial
oﬀerings. How could a mortal be the father of a deity’s son? This was
blasphemy of the highest order!
Lanevus decided to leave Tingen ahead of time and left clues to the
Nighthawks, the Mandated Punishers, and the Machinery Hivemind
so that they could resolve the repercussions of his actions. There was
ultimately a price needed for lunacy.
However, Lanevus didn’t write the letter directly to the Beyonder
squads. He thought it would make him look stupid.
He decided to leave the letter in one of the houses that he rented. He
pretended to be playing a game with the Beyonders from oﬃcial
bodies. As such, he didn’t bring up Hood Eugen’s contamination and
brought with him everything that he had obtained.
Just in case, he informed Sirius Arapis in the safest way he could. The
latter didn’t quite believe him, but he could faintly feel the possibility
of success.
…
Selena Wood accidentally chanced upon the real magic mirror
divination incantation from her mysticism teacher, Hanass Vincent.
Her bold attempt was interrupted by Klein Moretti by coincidence.
The latter successfully resolved this supernatural incident that
might’ve caused serious casualties.
The Nighthawks then investigated Hanass Vincent who had recently
been awarded. Therefore, Dunn Smith coincidently saw a clear image
of the True Creator in his dream and suﬀered severe injuries.
However, he wasn’t contaminated because of what happened. That
would’ve been noticed by the upper echelons of the Nighthawks.
The injury made Dunn Smith’s contamination by the Antigonus
family notebook worsen. His absent-mindedness and forgetfulness
worsened, and he was getting closer and closer to satisfying Ince
Zangwill’s requirements.
…
Many rows were scribbled away again.
Seriously unbelievable! Klein Moretti noticed Ince Zangwill’s secret
inﬂuence and saw the crimson chimney.
Th-this is because he was reminded by the teacher from the Khoy
University’s Department of History, Azik. He possesses many secrets.
But even so, it’s astounding enough for Klein to discover actual clues.
It’s unexplainable.
Regardless of the reason, Ince Zangwill continued to act, and the
story continues.
Klein coincidently ran into Sirius at the library and had no choice but
to kill him. Hence, the clues leading to Lanevus were abruptly
severed, and the discovery of the problem was delayed.
…
Klein met Megose, but his spirituality stopped him from observing
her closely. However, he didn’t notice the subtle abnormality. That is
logical. Our stories aren’t made up randomly.
He searched for the red chimney, but he always opted for a route that
didn’t include his target. Maybe in another two or three months,
when he was on the last batch, he would ﬁnd the real red chimney
house.
…
Rows and rows of writings were scribbled away, more than all of the
previous rows added together.
Dunn Smith’s problem was alleviated! His condition obviously
became better! He actually mastered the “acting method!”
And this was taught to him by Klein Moretti, who found inspiration
from Daly Simone and Old Neil’s example. No—Ince Zangwill didn’t
believe that, but he could only change his original plans slightly.
New elements in the story came to play.
Azik decided to go to Backlund in search of his lost memories.
It wasn’t long until Klein and Dunn found clues from Hood Eugen.
…
In order to ensure that Tingen City’s Conservative Party and New
Party would be in complete opposition, Madam Sharon, who wanted
to vent the accumulated madness after her transformation, decided to
take the risk and murder Member of Parliament John Maynard.
“Her motive wasn’t strong enough, but she took action anyway.
There are always times when people are not clear-minded enough,
and she happened to be in that stage. Besides, she was conﬁdent that
she wouldn’t be discovered.
Maynard’s wife found the Blackthorn Security Company through the
tobacco merchant, Vickroy. They didn’t disappoint her, and they
quickly found Madam Sharon’s abnormality.
Dunn Smith, who possessed power that was close to Sequence 6,
decided to take action ﬁrst. He passed the Sealed Artifact 3-0271 to
Kenley.
When the two of them and Klein returned to Madam Sharon’s
residence, Dunn attempted to pull her into a dream to control her
from a distance.”
It was a good plan, but, unfortunately, Madam Sharon happened to
have the statue of the Primordial Demoness by her side.
Hence, the Nighthawks’ plan failed. Kenley reﬂected himself in the
mirror due to his nervousness and saw himself.
Madam Sharon was taken care of while Kenley died. Dunn blamed
himself and consumed Kenley’s Beyonder characteristic as he usually
did. His digestion procedure was interrupted as a result and was
delayed. As such, his mental state became unstable.
Under the circumstances, Leonard and Klein noticed the letter left
behind by Lanevus.
Megose received a baﬄing summoning and arrived at Zouteland
Street. She entered the Blackthorn Security Company, and the baby in
her stomach was at a critical point in its development. It couldn’t
stop her urges.
Dunn made a detailed plan, a plan that was right, but he made one
mistake. If he steeled his resolve to Megose behind Chanis Gate, he
would’ve stood a chance with the aid of the environment and the
items present. If he wanted to wait for backup, he deﬁnitely shouldn’t
have just taken Saint Selena’s urn out.
Unfortunately, Dunn’s mind wasn’t in the right place due to recent
events, and he didn’t think of the most critical point. A diety’s son
would be able to feel the threat of the Saint’s urn. Hence, it was
triggered and started to absorb its mother’s strength in a bid to be
born ahead of time, even though it wasn’t exactly ready.
Azik was in Backlund, but he wasn’t a Traveler, so he couldn’t rush
back in such short notice.
A few rows were scribbled away.
Megose became a monster, and the ﬁght began. With the aid of the
Saint’s urn, Blood Vessel Thief, and two high-level charms that
strangely appeared, Megose died and the deity’s son was exorcized.
Dunn Smith died as a result, and the power of Saint Selena’s ashes
was severely damaged as well. That went perfectly with Ince
Zangwill’s intentions.
Ince Zangwill didn’t get a chance to showcase himself, but it didn’t
hinder him from achieving his goal.
He killed Klein Moretti, the fellow who kept disrupting his plans, and
he took away Saint Selena’s ashes.
Ince Zangwill set up a ritual with the remaining half of the
characteristic of Death’s descendant. He consumed Saint Selena’s
ashes and successfully advanced from Sequence 5 of the Death
Sequence pathway, Gatekeeper, to Sequence 4 of the Evernight
Sequence pathway, Nightwatcher. As such, he received godhood
characteristics and became a Demigod.
The sun continues to shine brilliantly on the land. Nearly no one in
Tingen City realized how they narrowly escaped a huge disaster.
Monster Ademisaul would be left very confused about it.
The notebook was ﬂipped to the last page. A middle-aged man that
was holding onto the book had dark blond hair, a dark blue eye that
was nearly black, a tall nose, and tightly pursed lips. His facial
features were like that of a statue and didn’t have a single wrinkle.
He held a classic quill with his slightly pale hand and wrote a line
clearly without dipping into any ink.
He ended with a simple sentence.
Tingen’s story ends here.
The papers rustled as he closed the book, leaving only a brown cover.
Chapter 211: Funeral
In the basement of Saint Selena Cathedral, in the guardroom outside
Chanis Gate.
Leonard Mitchell was leaning on the back of his chair, his legs were
propped up on the table. His eyes were vacant without any focus.
Even though he had been healed using ritualistic magic, he still
looked terrible, as if he had obtained reprieve from a severe illness
without fully recovering.
At the moment, the powerful Beyonders sent by the Holy Cathedral
were creating another seal behind the Chanis Gate since the ashes of
Saint Selena was lost. They had conﬂicting opinions; some wanting to
ﬁll in the gap of power using a new holy item, while the others
believed that there was no need to go through all the trouble. After
all, to the Church of the Evernight Goddess, holy items were rare and
incredibly precious. What they suggested was lowering the presence
of the Nighthawks in Tingen and transferring the artifacts with living
characteristics or diﬃcult-to-seal artifacts to the headquarters at the
Cathedral of Serenity in Backlund’s diocese, only leaving behind
those that could be controlled more easily.
They intended to send a telegram to propose a meeting of the higher-
ups, to get a vote from the archbishops and high-ranking deacons.
Leonard was uninterested in this debate. He felt as if he had become
a living corpse, with no sorrow, grief, agitation, or excitement. He
was abnormally numb. He didn’t want to face anyone. All he wanted
was to stay alone in the corner.
Occasionally, he would feel puzzled about why the “murderer” would
only take away Klein’s Beyonder characteristic and leave Captain
Dunn Smith’s one intact.
Thud. Thud. Thud. Footsteps reverberated in the corridor. Seeka Tron,
whose right arm had been bandaged, appeared at the door of the
guardroom.
While Klein and the others were attacking Megose and attempting to
save Tingen City, she and the Keepers within Chanis Gate were doing
battle against a portion of the Sealed Artifacts. If it wasn’t for the
timely arrival of the members of the Mandated Punishers and the
Machinery Hivemind, or the eventual arrival of the reinforcements
from the Holy Cathedral, she also might’ve lost her life.
But even so, the elderly Keeper failed to last untill the end. He fought
to his death, under the call of duty.
“Leonard, I found an unencrypted telegram in the Captain’s oﬃce. It
was sent over by the Holy Cathedral,” Seeka Tron said.
Leonard’s green eyes moved slightly, ﬁnally coming to life. He faintly
recalled the sound of a new telegram coming in, but the battle was
about to begin. He and Klein didn’t have the time to pay attention to
it.
“What does it say?” Leonard noticed that his tone was unusually
raspy.
The white-haired and black-eyed Seeka Tron replied without
hesitation, “Beware of Ince Zangwill. Beware of Sealed Artifact 0-08.”
“Ince Zangwill, the archbishop that betrayed the Church, the
Gatekeeper who failed his advancement… Sealed Artifact 0-08, an
ordinary looking quill…” Leonard muttered at ﬁrst as he searched his
memories, then he tilted his head to the side.
He suddenly narrowed his eyes, the dispirited feelings and sadness
disappeared from his body.
“So that’s how it was…” Leonard pulled his feet back and stood up,
his green eyes burning with a passion.
He looked at Seeka Tron and said, “I intend to apply to join the Red
Gloves.”
The Red Gloves was a code name for the elite team of Nighthawks.
Under normal circumstances, Nighthawk teams were situated locally
and had regions under their jurisdiction. They were not permitted to
capture criminals outside of their area of jurisdiction without
permission. As such, some evildoers would change their location after
every crime, making it terribly inconvenient for the Nighthawks.
To deal with this, the Church of the Evernight Goddess set up the Red
Gloves. They were carefully selected elites, some even possessing
incomplete holy items. Their mission was to reinforce Nighthawk
teams that had called for help, as well as track down and arrest
evildoers without any restrictions.
In some circles, they were also called “Pursuers” or “Hunting Dogs.”
“Red Gloves? But their lowest requirement is Sequence 7… Besides,
the dangers the Red Gloves face are many times higher than an
ordinary Nighthawk Squad,” Seeka Tron said in concern and doubt.
Leonard smiled coldly.
“I’m close to advancing soon.”
His eyes became cold. He clenched his teeth and said to himself.
I want revenge!
Ince Zangwill, you must live until the day I become powerful enough!
“Alright…” Seeka seemed to have guessed Leonard’s thoughts. She
sighed. “Almost half of our team will be new faces. It’s rare to see a
Nighthawk team become so ravaged…”
Leonard’s expression darkened. He clenched his teeth and asked, “Are
the bodies ready?”
“Yes.” Seeka nodded indiscernibly.
Leonard suddenly stepped towards the door.
“I’ll notify their families.”
I’ll deal with the scene I don’t want to deal with the most.
I’ll do it…
…
At 2 Daﬀodil Street, Melissa sat on the sofa, inspecting the three
tickets in her hands. She was looking at the words, the printed date,
and the seat numbers.
Benson was sitting beside her, observing his sister with a smile. He
had a relaxed posture.
Suddenly, they heard the doorbell. Ding dong, ding dong.
Melissa glanced at their busy maid Bella, then she took the three
tickets with her and stood up, looking a little confused. She briskly
ran to the door.
Her black hair was shinier than it was before, her face no longer
skinny. The color of her skin had a ruddy color, and her brown eyes
looked brighter and energetic.
Twisting the handle and opening the door, Melissa froze for a
moment. She didn’t recognize their visitor.
It was a young man with black hair and green eyes. He looked
handsome, but his face was unusually pale. Hidden in his eyes was
deep sorrow.
“May I know who you are?” Melissa asked, feeling somewhat lost.
Leonard had specially draped a black formal coat over his white shirt.
He said in a raspy voice, “I’m a colleague of your brother Klein.
Melissa’s heart suddenly skipped a beat. She instinctively tiptoed to
look behind Leonard but didn’t notice anything.
She said with a strange quiver in her voice, “Where’s Klein?”
Leonard closed his eyes, inhaling as he said, “I’m very sorry, your
brother Klein died at the hands of an evil criminal while he was
trying to save others. He’s a hero, a true hero.”
Melissa widened her eyes slowly, her body shaking indiscernibly. The
three tickets in her hands dropped helplessly onto the ﬂoor.
The tickets faced upward, revealing the name of the play—”The
Return of the Count.”
…
Sitting in the Moretti family’s living room, Leonard didn’t dare to
look directly at Melissa and Benson.
But he couldn’t stop scenes of what they looked like from ﬂashing
through his mind.
That girl ﬁlled with youthfulness and vibrancy had her eyes wide
open. She didn’t speak, and her eyes were unfocused. Her silence
made her appear like a puppet.
The man who looked a little like Klein maintained a normal posture,
but he would slip into a daze from time to time. His words came out
slowly.
“That’s the gist of the matter. I’m very sorry that I was unable to
prevent it in a timely manner. The Blackthorn Security Company, the
police department, and those that he helped have promised a
bereavement compensation of about 6000 pounds…” Leonard said, as
his eyes darted around.
Suddenly, Benson interrupted him. His voice was hoarse as he asked,
“Where’s his body? I’m asking where’s Klein’s body?”
He puckered his lips and paused.
“When can we see him?”
“In the company. You can see him now,” Leonard answered, unable
to mask his grief.
“Alright.” Benson moved his rigid lips with great diﬃculty. “Let me
use the bathroom ﬁrst.”
Without waiting for Leonard’s reply, he quickly entered the bathroom
and slammed the door closed.
He stood in front of the sink and turned on the tap, allowing the
water to ﬂow.
He bent down and repeatedly splashed water onto his face.
As he did that, his actions came to a sudden stop. Nothing changed
for a long time, leaving only the sound of running water
reverberating in the bathroom.
A few minutes later, Benson lifted his head and looked into the
mirror. He saw that his face was covered in water droplets, the
redness in his eyes was impossible to hide now.
…
A few days later, in a corner of the Raphael Cemetery.
After ﬁnishing Dunn’s funeral, the crowd gathered before a new
tombstone. On it was Klein’s black-and-white photograph, a very
scholarly photograph.
Melissa stood before the grave, her eyes without focus. Beside her,
Elizabeth kept wiping away her tears.
Leonard, Benson, Frye, and Bredt carried the coﬃn and walked over,
lowering the coﬃn into the grave.
After the priest gave the eulogy and individual prayers, the grave was
ﬁlled with soil, covering the black coﬃn bit by bit.
At this moment, Melissa knelt down and tossed in the copper whistle
she found on her brother’s body.
Leonard turned and looked at the scene, his heart wincing. However,
he admired how strong this girl was. He knew that this girl didn’t cry
after receiving the bad news. Instead, she stayed pitifully quiet.
The grave was leveled and a stone slab was laid over it. Leonard took
a ﬁnal look at Klein’s tombstone. There were three lines to his
epitaph:
The best elder brother,
The best younger brother,
The best colleague.
Under the mournful atmosphere, the members of the Blackthorn
Security Company gradually left. Selena and Elizabeth also bade
farewell under the urging of their families. The only people left
behind were Benson and Melissa.
“I’ll get a rental carriage…” Benson was in a terrible condition, it was
as if he hadn’t slept for a long time.
“Alright.” Melissa nodded.
After seeing her brother leave, she turned to look at the tombstone.
She squatted down and buried her face in her arms.
After some silence, Melissa suddenly scolded, “Stupid!”
She cried as she wept silently. Her tears just wouldn’t stop.
…
Night time, at the Raphael Cemetery.
The copper-skinned Azik stood in front of Klein’s grave holding a
bouquet of white ﬂowers. He didn’t speak for the longest time until
he ﬁnally sighed and muttered to himself, “I’m sorry, I was ten
minutes late. But I think I know who it was…”
He bent over and set the bouquet of ﬂowers down before turning to
leave the cemetery. He also left Tingen, but he didn’t retrieve the
copper whistle.
The place was quiet and serene under the illumination of the crimson
moonlight.
Suddenly, the stone slab sealing the grave was ﬂipped open. A pale
hand extended out from the soil.
A hand came out!
Whoosh!
The gravestone was shoved aside. The lid of the coﬃn was pushed
open. Klein sat upright and looked around, lost.
His memory was still frozen at the scene with the brand new leather
boots, and the palm that grabbed onto the urn of Saint Selena’s ashes.
Everything after that felt like a dreamless sleep.
Klein instinctively lowered his head and unbuttoned his shirt. He
looked at the left side of his chest, only to see that his ravaged injury
and missing heart were squirming as they healed, similar to how he
recovered from the bullet wound through his temple back when he
looked into the mirror. The only diﬀerence was that this time, the
recovery was much slower and much more diﬃcult.
Chapter 212: Avenger
In the northern part of the Loen Kingdom, the September breeze, that
had an additional coldness to it, howled through the cemetery. It was
even gloomier and colder than usual.
The cold jolted Klein back to his senses as he muttered with a rueful
smile, “It looks like there are still some secrets behind my
transmigration…
“But it seems like I’ll only be able to resurrect another two times at
most, not any more… And if I were to minced up or completely
crushed, who knows if this recovery ability that doesn’t usually
appear would even be useful…”
…
After half a minute, Klein buttoned his suit and realized that he was
wearing his newest shirt and tuxedo, but they were now covered in
soil and dirt.
… Benson and Melissa really have no idea how to save money… The
thought popped into his head. He supported his weight on his hand
and ﬂipped up into a standing position, realizing that he still had his
Clown abilities.
The best elder brother… The best younger brother… The best colleague…
Klein looked at his tombstone and read the inscription. He felt his
heart wince, seemingly sensing the despondent feelings Melissa and
Benson had experienced.
This is probably even more depressing than watching Captain die before
my eyes…He sighed and retracted his gaze. He squatted down and
closed the coﬃn lid.
His thoughts were still scattered, but Klein knew that he had to take
care of the scene as soon as possible and not let anyone notice.
Resurrection wasn’t something any commoner could accept!
If the Nighthawks, Mandated Punishers, or the Machinery Hivemind
learned of this, Klein believed that he wouldn’t have a great ending.
Of course, if it was on Earth, he could deceive the people into
believing that he was the blessed one of God, the man of salvation,
had he consumed the Lawyer or Swindler potions. However, in the
world he was in, there was a real god, a real god that could respond
to rituals!
He scraped the soil back together and covered it with the stone slab.
Klein clapped his hands and stood up once again.
At that moment, the scene didn’t appear strange. He was just like a
gentleman who came to oﬀer his condolences late at night. The only
oddity was that the person in the photo on the tombstone looked
exactly like him.
During the process of ﬁlling his grave, his spirituality noticed the
existence of Azik’s copper whistle. Hence, he dug it out and wiped it
clean.
However, Klein didn’t intend to summon the messenger immediately.
He decided to ﬁgure out the situation ﬁrst.
Klein lifted his left hand and saw the topaz pendant that was still
wrapped around his wrist.
“I guess this is considered a burial object?” He gave a self-deprecating
laugh and took oﬀ the pendulum. He looked around, and his face
grew solemn. “… Captain should be buried in this cemetery as well, I
guess…”
He changed directions twice and ﬁnally determined the location of
Dunn’s tombstone using the pendulum.
With the moonlight’s aid, Klein walked around and searched for
about ﬁfteen minutes until he ﬁnally saw Captain’s monochrome
photo. It had a gentle expression, high hairline, gray eyes—nothing
unusual compared to before.
Under Dunn’s photo was his name, date of birth, date of death, and
epitaph.
The true guardian,
The most trusted partner,
The Captain forever.
Klein looked in stunned silence and somehow his sight grew blurry
for some baﬄing reason. He felt as though he had returned to that
day again. He saw the Captain turn his head to him and wink. He
spoke with a mellow and relaxed voice.
“We saved Tingen.”
Captain… Klein shouted in silence.
He stood there like a statue for a good few minutes until he suddenly
said with a smile, “Captain, your mental state was deﬁnitely not the
best that day. You even said things like you could bring Old Neil into
the dreamland if he hadn’t lost control. He was a Mystery Pryer, and
you’re a Nightmare. You couldn’t consume the Beyonder
characteristic that he left behind. Yes… You didn’t ask me what
powerful oﬀensive attacks I had. Was it trust, or did you forget about
it… But, you deﬁnitely guessed something… I only took one Sealed
Artifact and said it was for Leonard. Even without a brain, you
could’ve guessed that I had the extra means for a powerful attack.”
Having said that, Klein paused, then he shook his head and sighed.
“I have no idea what I am now. Maybe I’m just an evil spirit that has
clawed its way back from hell to seek revenge…”
As he spoke, he suddenly stopped. His tears streamed down his
cheeks and ﬁnally, he shouted softly with a choking voice,
“Captain… We miss you too!”
Klein felt the cold breeze blow past him as he lifted his hands to wipe
his tears and blow his nose.
He became silent again and found a hidden spot nearby. He took four
steps counterclockwise and entered the world above the gray fog.
He wanted to ﬁnd the person that killed him with the aid of
divination. He wanted to know the murderer who triggered all of
this!
As he’s already appeared before me, I’m sure that I can divine some
information…Klein pursed his lips tightly together and saw the lofty
palace and ancient mottled table as usual.
He took the seat that belonged to The Fool. A yellowish-brown
goatskin and fountain pen appeared before him.
Since his physical body in reality was under limited protection, Klein
didn’t delay and wrote down his divination statement after a
moment’s thought.
“The person who killed me.”
He recited it seven times and leaned back into the chair. He entered
his dream with the aid of Cogitation.
In the blurry world, there were countless points of light dancing and
gathering. In the end, they formed a scene.
A pair of brand new leather boots, a pair of slightly pale hands, and
the Saint Selena’s urn that was held by those hands.
He looked up, and Klein saw a middle-aged man with short, dark
blond hair.
He wore a black two-button suit, and one of his eyes was obviously
blind while the other one was so blue that it was almost black. His
facial features were like carvings, and his face had no wrinkles at all.
The image shattered and Klein woke up from his dream. His
eyebrows were tightly knitted. He found his murderer very familiar.
As a Seer, he quickly understood why he found the person familiar. It
was because he had seen the man’s photo on a wanted notice!
The murderer was Ince Zangwill! He was the former Archbishop of
the Church of the Evernight Goddess who took Sealed Artifact 0-08.
He had failed to advance as a Gatekeeper!
“It’s him!” Countless images ﬂashed through Klein’s head, and they
ﬁnally stopped on the scene when Ince Zangwill picked up Saint
Selena’s urn.
Tap. Tap. Tap. Klein extended his hands and rapped the edge of the
long bronze table. He felt that he suddenly understood many things.
“The Captain said that a Beyonder that dies normally would leave
behind a Beyonder characteristic. When gathered together, they’re
equivalent to a potion that lacks the supplementary ingredients.
“In other words, as long as one knows the corresponding
supplementary ingredients, they can advance using “remains”. Of
course, one cannot consume beyond their level, as it would easily
lead to a loss of control or going insane.
“Hmm… Becoming a High-Sequence Beyonder would require the
accompaniment of some special ritual. That was mentioned in the
incomplete Unshadowed formula… The subsequent advancements
would require a ritual as well…
“Ince Zangwill is a Gatekeeper, a Sequence 5 from the Death
Sequence pathway. He wanted to become a High-Sequence Beyonder,
a Demigod. Based on the situation allowed by the exchanging of
Sequences, he had three choices. One was obviously Sequence 4 in
the Death Sequence pathway, second was Sequence 4 in the Sleepless
Sequence pathway; and third was Sequence 4 in the God of Combat
Sequence pathway, Demon Hunter.
“Saint Selena was a Saint. She was either Sequence 4 or Sequence 3.
Her urn corresponds to one of the two Sequence potions… Ince
Zangwill, who was a former Archbishop, deﬁnitely knew exactly
which one she was, and he deﬁnitely knew the required
supplementary ingredients…
“Was his true motive in planning all of this to get Saint Selena’s ashes
and advance to Sequence 4 in the Sleepless pathway?
“Hmm, the skull of Death’s descendant, that might be an ingredient
needed for the special ritual. It was from the Death Sequence
pathway, after all.
“From the looks of it, his target was the Captain, and not me. He
really was the mastermind behind all this…”
Having ﬁgured this out, Klein wrote down a corresponding divination
statement. He took his pendulum and let the topaz hang above the
surface of the paper.
After he recited the statement, he opened his eyes and saw the topaz
pendant spinning clockwise.
It meant that the information he provided was suﬃcient, and the
divination was successful!
It meant that Ince Zangwill had really plotted the series of events in
order to get Saint Selena’s ashes, to advance to Sequence 4!
Klein rapped on the edge of the table again as he mulled over a
diﬀerent question.
“Ince Zangwill was merely a Sequence 5 Gatekeeper. Relying on him
alone, would make it impossible for him to create so many
coincidences. For instance, for Megose to follow his “arrangements”
and visit the Nighthawks at the correct time.
“So, is it the power of Sealed Artifact 0-08?
“Its appearance is that of an ordinary quill… Its function is to write
down events that are bound to happen?
“No, it couldn’t be that easy… Otherwise, Ince Zangwill could write
that Saint Selena’s urn grew a pair of wings and ﬂew into his hands.
Then, he could’ve just waited at home…
“There must be certain restrictions…
“0-08 most likely doesn’t possess direct combat ability. Otherwise,
Ince Zangwill could’ve stormed through Chanis Gate in Tingen…
“As one of the most dangerous Sealed Artifacts, perhaps it can let
people act according to its description without realizing it? That was
the reason behind all the coincidences?
“If that’s really true, then 0-08 is quite terrifying. Even Megose who
was pregnant with the son of an evil god adhered to its
arrangements… No wonder Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts are ‘Extremely
Dangerous.’ They’re of the highest importance and of the highest
conﬁdentiality. They’re not to be inquired, disseminated, described,
or spied…”
Klein stopped rapping the edge of the table. He divined his earlier
guess, but, unfortunately, it failed due to a lack of information.
He saw that a few minutes had passed, and he planned to return to
the real world as soon as possible. Hence, he didn’t let his thoughts
run wild but wrote down the penultimate divination statement.
“The city where Ince Zangwill currently is.”
Due to the existence of Sealed Artifact 0-08 and the fact that Ince
Zangwill had likely become a Demigod, Klein couldn’t divine his
exact location directly. He could only make a rough inquiry of the
general area.
Of course, if there wasn’t a mysterious space like the world above the
gray fog to eliminate disturbances, he would deﬁnitely fail in
divination, even if it was a rough inquiry.
He leaned against the high-back chair and recited the divination
statement seven times. He dreamed again and entered the blurry
world.
The blurry world suddenly cracked, and there was a wide river which
was slightly murky.
There was a grand bridge above the river. Both banks had ports lined
one after another. There were many goods and many workers.
To the northeast of the river, there were rows upon rows of houses.
Most of them had the Loen Kingdom’s present-day architectural
styles, such as polygenic roofs, oriel windows, and no verandah by
the street. Other than that, there was a lot of Gothic architecture.
The streets were ﬁlled with people and carriages. From time to time,
strange machinery could be seen.
The farther east he went, the more chimneys there were and the
smokier it got. When he headed west, the elevation rose, and there
were houses in grayish-blue, beige, and light yellow that spiraled up
opulent castles and Gothic clock towers.
Gong!
The chime of a clock sounded and snapped Klein back to his senses.
He knew which city he had seen.
The “Land of Hope,” and the “City of Cities,” Backlund!
Chapter 213: Another Look
So Ince Zangwill has gone to Backlund… I wonder how long he’ll stay
there… Yes… I should conﬁrm this every now and then… Klein leaned
forward as he thought. He erased the contents on the goatskin and
wrote a new divination statement:
“Lanevus’s current location.”
From his point of view, the person that caused the Captain and him
to nearly die was undoubtedly Ince Zangwill, but the lunatic Lanevus
was deﬁnitely an accomplice who cannot shirk from the
responsibility. He had to pay the price in blood!
After reciting the statement seven times, Klein once again entered the
dream. But the scene that appeared after the foggy world shattered
was the same as the one he had seen before!
A wide, slightly murky river, countless piers and buildings. The buildings
were primarily in the present Loen architectural style, some a little more
Gothic. There were crowded streets, ﬂourishing sights, chimneys that
continually spewed smoke. There were opulent castles standing tall with
the trademark Gothic clock towers…
Lanevus was also in the “Land of Hope,” the “City of Cities,”
Backlund!
Klein opened his eyes, a little confused. He had divined for Lanevus’s
speciﬁc location, but the results were still a very general, vague
region.
This tells me that Lanevus’s Sequence must be much higher than I
imagined… No, it could also be that he’s received a large beneﬁt from
helping the son of the True Creator descend upon this world. For example,
a little godhood characteristics, or some object similar to the placenta left
behind by Megose’s baby? Hmm… The latter would most likely have been
taken away by Ince Zangwill. Thoughts ran through Klein’s mind as he
muttered to himself whilst he made initial assumptions.
After conﬁrming the rough area where both his enemies were, he
thought about another problem. He still didn’t have the ability to
exact revenge!
Even if Lanevus is only a Sequence 7, or even 8, it wouldn’t be easy to
deal with him if he did indeed receive a large beneﬁt. Lanevus is also
obviously very crafty, he could outwit and defeat Beyonders more
powerful than himself… Ince Zangwill is even more terrifying. He’s a
Sequence 4 Demigod, and he wields a powerful Grade 0 Sealed Artifact…
Although there were some secrets surrounding my transmigration, it’s clear
that I can’t convert those secrets into combat strength. It’s likely that it’s
not possible for a very long period of time… The only means that I have
are to continue raising my Sequence, or I could collect even more powerful
mystical items. I have to use both the methods at the same time…
In between his thoughts, Klein decided to add another divination.
He deliberated on the statement before writing solemnly, “My
opportunities of becoming powerful.”
He gently placed the pen on the table and leaned back, then he
closed his eyes.
He recited the statement silently and fell into a deep sleep with the
help of Cogitation.
In the foggy world, he once again saw the scene that he had
previously seen. The river, piers, chimneys, crowds, castles, various
machinery, and Gothic clock towers. He had once again seen the
capital of the Loen Kingdom, Backlund!
Immediately following that, the scene changed. He saw a magniﬁcent
peak piercing through the clouds, and, on it, he saw a majestic,
ancient palace. He saw the giant throne carved from stone, adorned
with dull gems and gold. He saw a strange vertical pupil formed from
countless mysterious symbols.
The scene shattered silently without warning. Klein slowly sat up and
tapped on the edge of the table with his ﬁngers.
Backlund contains the opportunities for me to become powerful…
Does the second scene refer to the main peak of the Hornacis mountain
range, the treasures left behind by the Antigonus family? The strange
vertical pupil formed by countless mysterious symbols which the
Misfortune Cloth Puppet conveyed to me through the corruption from the
Antigonus family’s notebook is the key to beginning all of this…
Many thoughts ﬂashed through his mind. Klein decided that he was
in no rush to visit the Hornacis mountain range. Even a Sequence 4
Demigod might not be able to deal with the dangers that resided
there.
I guess I’ll head to Backlund ﬁrst… Klein sighed and made a decision.
He enveloped himself with spirituality and stimulated a descent,
exiting the mysterious space above the gray fog.
When he returned to the material world, he slowly walked out of his
hiding spot towards Dunn Smith’s grave.
He stared deeply at the picture and epitaph. Klein slowly drew a
crimson moon on his chest and walked out of the cemetery.
As a former Nighthawk, a Nighthawk who had to regularly patrol
Raphael Cemetery, he was quite familiar with the routes of the
guards, as well its surroundings. He managed to leave the cemetery
easily, without causing any alarm. He followed the gravel road into
Tingen, using the shade of the trees as cover.
The night was peaceful and the moon was ever-so dreamy. Klein
walked alone, his thoughts running wild and unbridled. He
sometimes considered his plan for revenge, sometimes thinking back
to the times he spent with the Captain, sometimes recalling Old Neil’s
hidden grief beneath his humorous facade…
Unknowingly, Klein had entered the nearest street like a wandering
ghost, making his way past turn after turn.
It was two hours later when he freed himself from that state and
regained complete control of his thoughts.
He realized that he was standing on Daﬀodil Street. Opposite him
was the house he shared with his brother and sister.
Instinctively, Klein had returned here.
He took a step forward with clear joy, but suddenly paused. He let
out a bitter smile and muttered with a self-deprecating tone, “If I
went up and knocked on the door, Melissa might faint from shock…
Benson would be so nervous his hair would start to drop. He would
then try his best to calmly convince me, in the name of a curly-haired
baboon…”
Shaking his head, Klein stared at the familiar door for a while before
heading towards Iron Cross Street.
This is ﬁne too, this is ﬁne too… The things that I do in the future will not
implicate them. The compensation given to them by the Nighthawks team
and the police department will be enough for them to live a stable middle-
class life, even if Melissa fails to ﬁnd a job and Benson loses his job…
Klein walked silently for a moment before starting to feel fatigue.
But, as someone who was “dead,” he didn’t have any other
belongings on him except for the clothes he was wearing, his topaz
pendulum, and Azik’s copper whistle. He didn’t have pounds, nor
soli, nor pennies.
Should I give the whistle a blow to send a letter to Mr. Azik and get him to
help me?Klein laughed optimistically. Forget it, I shouldn’t contact him
for the time being. Perhaps Ince Zangwill is still keeping him under
surveillance. I’ll look for him when the time is right… To an old monster
who has lived countless lives for thousands of year, he should be able to
understand resurrection… At least it’s not too cold tonight. I’ll make do by
ﬁnding a place to sleep for the time being and head to the Tingen branch
of the Backlund Bank tomorrow morning to retrieve the money in the
anonymous account.
As there had been too many things to do lately. Klein hadn’t had the
time to start on the experiments involving the sacriﬁcial ritual. He
hadn’t touched the 300 pounds in the anonymous account either.
That should be enough to support my expenses for quite a while. I’ll buy a
newspaper tomorrow to conﬁrm what day it is… Miss Justice and the
others didn’t make any new prayers, which means that I didn’t miss a
gathering… Klein thought as he found a spot that had no wind. He sat
down and took oﬀ his jacket. He used it as a blanket and leaned on
the wall to sleep.
It wasn’t long into his sleep when he was suddenly woken by
someone. He saw a policeman wielding a baton.
He only had a single chevron on his epaulet, the lowest-ranking
police constable… Klein glanced at him to ascertain his identity.
The policeman said ﬁercely, “You can’t sleep here!
“The streets and parks aren’t for you lazy, jobless vagrants to sleep
in!
“Those are the terms in the Poor Law!”
Is that so? Klein froze. Given his sensitive identity, he didn’t argue
with the policeman.
He grabbed his jacket and continued walking until daybreak.
Soon after, he lowered his head and entered the Tingen branch of the
Backlund Bank. He took out 200 pounds with the password he had
set, leaving behind a third of the money as “savings,” in case of any
emergencies.
Without a doubt, Klein heard “prayers” when he wrote the password
in ancient Hermes.
Klein then spent 38 pounds on two sets of formal wear, two shirts,
two trousers, two pairs of leather boots, two bow ties, four pairs of
socks, as well as two thick double-breasted jackets, two solid colored
fur coats, and two pairs of thick trousers in preparation for the
winter. He also bought a cane, a wallet, and a leather luggage bag.
After completing his purchase, Klein found a hotel to wash up and
change in. He rented a private carriage directly to the train station in
Tingen in order to avoid meeting anyone familiar. Along the way, he
purchased a newspaper and discovered that it was Sunday.
It took about four hours to get from Tingen to Backlund by train. A
luxurious ﬁrst-class seat cost about three-quarters of a pound, or 15
soli. A second-class seat cost 10 soli, or half a pound.
The packed, poorly-maintained third-class seats were rather cheap at
only 5 soli.
Klein thought for a moment before buying a seat for the two o’clock
train, a second-class seat.
Klein found a random spot to sit in the waiting area with his ticket
and luggage in hand. It was only slightly after nine in the morning.
He was happy that the Loen Kingdom didn’t have a strict census. He
could prove his identity just by using the water and gas bills, as well
as his rent for the past three months. Purchasing a train ticket was
even easier, as all he needed was money.
Klein suddenly had an empty feeling in his heart as he was sitting
there, thinking about how he was about to leave for Backlund from
Tingen in the afternoon.
He thought about his sister who always gave him a motherly vibe. He
thought about his brother who liked to crack cold jokes. He thought
about how they would ﬁll their stomachs up so much that they
wouldn’t feel like moving…
Recalling these scenes, Klein suddenly laughed. He laughed bitterly,
for he thought about the tortoise that Melissa called a “puppet,” as
well as Benson’s pitiful hairline.
He suddenly had a strong urge. He wanted to see his siblings again.
At this moment, Klein suddenly realized why he hadn’t picked an
earlier train but instead bought a ticket for the two o’clock train.
He carried his luggage and left the waiting area quickly, taking a
rented carriage back to Daﬀodil Street.
He then hid in a shady area on the opposite side and looked at the
door to his house. There were many times when he felt like heading
over, but he couldn’t bring himself to cross the wide street.
Klein looked across the road in a daze, suddenly having a feeling of
homelessness. He’d had a similar feeling when he had just
transmigrated.
Suddenly, he saw the door to the house open as Melissa and Benson
came out.
Melissa was wearing a black dress and black veiled hat. Benson was
in a shirt, vest, trousers, coat, and hat, all in black. They both had
numb, sullen expressions.
Melissa has become skinnier… Why is Benson so haggard… Klein’s heart
winced in pain. He opened his mouth but couldn’t shout out their
names.
Without realizing it, he followed Benson and Melissa to the nearest
municipal square. He saw that tents had been erected there again. A
new circus troupe was in town for a performance.
Benson took out some money and purchased the entrance tickets and
led Melissa into the circus. He forced a smile.
“This circus troupe is very famous.”
Melissa nodded without expression.
“Okay.”
Suddenly, she slipped and almost fell.
Klein, who was also buying a ticket, opened his mouth. He wanted to
help his sister, but he could only retract the hand he had instinctively
extended and stood helplessly in the busy crowd.
Benson jumped in fright, but he was too late to help. However,
Melissa quickly steadied herself. She puckered her lips and said
nothing.
At this moment, clowns swarmed forward, some performing
balancing acts on wheels or large rubber balls, others tossing
countless tennis balls into the air, then ridiculously catching every
one of them.
Melissa seemed to disregard the clowns as she looked at the
performance. Benson tried to lift his sister’s spirits by cheering, but
he didn’t succeed. He slowly turned sullen too.
Klein puckered his lips tightly as he watched this scene from afar. He
wanted to approach them, but he didn’t dare to.
Suddenly, he touched the wallet in his jacket and had an idea.
Benson and Melissa continued walking forward, silently watching the
various performances.
Some time later, they saw a clown running towards them. His face
was painted in colorful pastels. At ﬁrst, he threw a tennis ball into
the air, and, while the attention of the surrounding people was drawn
to the air, he conjured a ﬂower out of thin air. It was a Seville
Chrysanthemum.
The clown brought the ﬂower before Melissa and Benson. The ﬂower
was golden in color and symbolized happiness.
Melissa and Benson looked at the clown in a daze. All they saw was a
wide smile plastered over the pastel face. It was a happy smile, an
exaggerated smile, a ridiculous smile.

Chapter 214: Land of Hope
Choo-choo!
A train whistle resounded in every corner of the station as a metal
behemoth, in the form of a steam locomotive, came to a slow stop
with more than twenty carriages in tow.
Dressed in a tuxedo and half top hat, Klein was carrying an
exaggerated luggage bag that appeared incongruent with his ﬁgure.
He took a ﬁrm step onto the ground of the Loen Kingdom’s capital,
Backlund.
This city was divided into two regions by the Tussock River which
ﬂowed to the southeast. The two lands were connected by the
Backlund Bridge and ferries, with a population exceeding ﬁve million
people. It was the most prosperous capital in the Southern and
Northern Continents.
Klein looked far into the distance and saw faint yellow hazes
everywhere. Visibility was terrible, and the gas lamps hanging above
the train platform were already lit to dispel the gloominess and
darkness.
It’s only half past six? It looks like it’s nine or ten… Klein shook his head
indiscernibly. Suddenly, he recalled a joke he read on the Tussock
Times.
A gentleman who just arrived in Backlund ﬁnds himself lost in the thick
haze. Helpless, he asks a drenched gentleman passing him by, “How do
you get to the Tussock River?” The gentleman answers him in a friendly
manner, “Walk straight without stopping. I just swam from there 1 .”
Every time I read Backlund newspapers or magazines, the reporters and
editors will make a mockery of the polluted air or the increasing number
of foggy days in every conceivable way possible… Previously, the
Backlund Daily Tribune even did the statistics, and it was found that it
has gone from about 60 days a year from thirty years ago to the present
75 days a year… For this, many farsighted people established
organizations like the Soot Reduction Association, Smoke Reduction
Association… Apparently, there was a bill in September that motioned the
need to establish the National Atmospheric Pollution Council… Klein
lowered his huge luggage bag and pinched his nose to gain respite
from the sudden discomfort.
Then, tracing his golden chain, he ﬁshed out a golden pocket watch
from his vest pocket. He popped it open and looked at the time.
When he truly bade farewell to his siblings, he had especially visited
a department store and spent 4 pounds 10 soli to buy a golden pocket
watch and matched it with a golden chain worth 1 pound 5 soli.
To not constantly be aware of the exact time made him feel a sense of
horror.
Klein had planned on buying a silver pocket watch as he felt it
matched his temperament. But after considering the true essence of a
Clown, he ﬁnally chose a more showy and exaggerated golden watch.
6:39… It’s not that much later… Klein put away his pocket watch and
held his cane and luggage bag as he slowly walked out the steam
locomotive station with the crowd.
Suddenly, he made a sudden turn, causing a person who was secretly
tailing him to have his hand fall empty when reaching for his pocket.
Klein was unfazed by this episode as he followed the cement-paved
road and mixed into the crowd, arriving at an intersection in front of
him.
There was a lawn and garden that circled around a column that
resembled a chimney.
No, it’s very likely a chimney… Klein saw the column spewing thick
smoke from its top end.
A portion of the smoke ﬂoated high into the sky as a portion
condensed into tiny liquid droplets that scattered everywhere.
Klein paused once again and placed his luggage down. He spread
open the newspaper and map that he had held onto using his other
hand.
While on the steam locomotive, he had already planned where he
was going to go or what to do next.
The experiences that he had undergone, and the mental experience
that he had, when disguised as a clown in the morning, made Klein
ﬁnally understand the true essence of a Clown—”Although being
capable of knowing a little about fate, one remains helpless towards
fate; therefore, one might as well use a smiling face to hide all the
pain, sorrow, confusion, and depression.”
At that moment, he clearly felt the Clown potion “digest” and
believed that if he continued “acting” this way, it wouldn’t take long
for him to make another attempt at advancing.
But herein lay the problem—he didn’t know the corresponding name
of the Sequence 7 potion, much less know its exact formula.
How should I obtain the formula? The Secret Order seldom appears. They
only seem to be interested in the Antigonus family’s items… This is also
why others have little understanding of them. Yes… I should consider two
aspects. One, I need to come into contact with the local Beyonder circles
and see if I can ﬁnd clues. Two, I should set a trap and use the Antigonus
family’s treasure as bait to lure the Secret Order out. After all, I do possess
knowledge of the strange vertical pupil formed from the numerous
mysterious symbols.
But that’s too risky. I need to be careful since the bait cannot be too good
or too bad. It won’t garner their interest if it’s too bad, and if it’s too good,
I might end up attracting a shark, a shark that can swallow me whole…
The Secret Order’s leader, Zaratul, is a ﬁgure who guided Emperor
Roselle. Maybe he had obtained the biggest slice of the pie during that
revolutionary feast… Of course, he might not still be alive as that was
something from two hundred years ago…
Amidst his thoughts, Klein felt the coldness of Backlund and couldn’t
help but shiver. He decided to ﬁnd a residence as soon as possible.
He ﬂipped through the papers and, once again, browsed through the
rental section and saw a circled advertisement.
15 Minsk Street, Cherwood Borough… terrace house… Weekly rent of 18
soli…
Klein had thought this through very carefully about the area in which
he was to stay in. Although Backlund had a population exceeding ﬁve
million people, he still needed to be wary about meeting the local
Nighthawks. Be it the newly transferred Daly or Lorotta, Aiur Harson,
and Borgia that he previously met, they would deﬁnitely be able to
recognize him.
Therefore, Klein eliminated the North Borough where the Church of
the Evernight Goddess’s Backlund diocese’s headquarters and Saint
Samuel Cathedral, was. He also eliminated areas with the best
security and the extremely strictly monitored Empress Borough and
Western Borough. These two boroughs belonged to the nobles and
the richest magnates, with more of the nobles living closer to
Empress Borough.
After eliminating the worker areas, the harbor, and the East Borough
and Backlund Bridge region where the poor gathered, Klein had few
choices left. The ﬁrst choice was Hillston Backlund where the
Backlund Stock Exchange, Clearing House, Futures Center, the seven
major banks’ headquarters, various Trust Funds, rail companies, and
bulk cargo commerce companies were. It was known as the ﬁnancial,
business, and economic center of the Loen Kingdom. The second
choice was Cherwood Borough where there were many small
companies and residential buildings.
The two boroughs had a lot of people in them, and the security was
relatively good. It was good for hiding in. After serious consideration,
Klein chose the cheaper Cherwood Borough.
The reason why he didn’t seek out organizations like the Capital
Housing Improvement Company or Capital Housing Improvement
Association was due to the fact that they needed identiﬁcation which
he couldn’t produce at the moment.
If I can’t ﬁnd a place to rent today, I’ll ﬁnd a motel that doesn’t need any
identiﬁcation to stay for the night… Klein gathered the things in his
hand and carried his luggage. According to the map, he walked
towards what seemed like a department store’s entrance.
That was the Backlund Metro’s entrance.
Yes, a metro!
The ﬁrst time Klein saw the word “metro” on the newspapers and
magazines, he nearly jumped in fright. He never expected that such a
transportation vehicle had become a reality in this era which hadn’t
entered the age of electricity.
It was born twenty-ﬁve years ago. It ﬁrst connected both banks of the
Tussock River and had now expanded to the key city boroughs. Of
course, there weren’t many stations.
Through the main door, Klein followed the people ahead of him as he
walked to the ticketing booth.
After being in line for a few minutes, he ﬁnally saw a cashier with a
head with beautiful golden hair.
The lady didn’t raise her head. All she did was point at the wooden
board by the side of the window with the prices.
Peak period (7am-9am, 6pm-8pm): 10-minute headway.
15-minute headway for all other times.
First-class seat: 6 pence
Second-class seat: 4 pence
Third-class seat: 3 pence.
Return trips are respectively: 9, 6, 5 pence.
Annual Pass
First-class: 8 pounds
Second-class: 5 pounds 10 soli
Third-class: No Annual Pass
It’s cheaper than I imagined… There’s actually no distance restriction…
Melissa would deﬁnitely love this more than a horse carriage. This is the
culmination of machinery… Klein thought as he suddenly felt upset.
He revealed a brilliant smile and ﬁshed out 4 pence and handed it to
the cashier.
“Second-class seat.”
Smack! The cashier tore a ticket and stamped it before handing it to
Klein.
After ﬁnding the line that led to Cherwood Borough and passing
through the not-very-strict security checks, Klein went down the
ﬂight of stairs and quickly came to the platform. He followed the
labels on the ground and found the corresponding location for
second-class seats.
Choo-choo!
He didn’t wait long before he heard the chugging sound of the train
and the thunderous steam whistle. He saw a huge steam locomotive
Its large and meandering body, together with its black metallic luster
and complex machinery, mixed together to form a unique beauty.
Backlund’s metro still used steam locomotives. The smoke that they
spewed was specially designed to enter a pipe above and travel
through a chimney, out into the world.
This was also the true usage for the lawn and garden out on the
streets.
Amidst the screeching sound of metal, Klein ﬁrst waited for the
passengers to alight before carrying his cane and luggage over slowly.
He then allowed the conductor to check his tickets.
Unlike the third-class seats, the second-class seats were one person to
a seat, so there were no concerns about having one’s seat snatched.
Just as Klein sat down, stowed away his luggage, and leaned on his
cane, he suddenly heard hurried footsteps.
He subconsciously looked towards the door and saw a thin,
adolescent boy rush into the carriage.
The boy was wearing a coat that didn’t suit his age. He wore a
rounded top hat and carried a ragged haversack. He kept his head
very low.
“I’m sorry. I got on the wrong carriage. I’m from third-class…” He
showed his ticket and apologized to the passengers before briskly
walking towards the third-class carriage.
Klein retracted his gaze and once again conﬁrmed his destination as
he waited for the doors to the carriage to close.
At that moment, he heard chaotic and hurried footsteps. He then saw
a few men dressed in black coats and half top hats rush into the
carriage.
Are they chasing after that ﬁfteen-year-old boy? Klein instinctively had
such a thought.
He shook his head gently and continued reading his newspapers and
map, just like the other passengers onboard the carriage.
Chapter 215: Mrs. Sammer
“Did you see a teenage boy? He’s wearing an old coat!” One of the
men who dashed into the carriage asked the conductor ﬁercely.
Klein glanced at the man through the corner of his eyes. He was thin
and hardy; his skin a dark shade from prolonged exposure to the sun.
His eyes were much more recessed than the typical Loen Kingdom
citizen.
A highlander? Or a mixed blood? He nodded thoughtfully.
In the middle of the Northern Continent, the point where the
Hornacis mountain range began, there was a highland which was
extremely hot and dry. Most of it belonged under the Feynapotter
Kingdom, while the area west belonged to the Intis Republic. The
area to the east belonged to the Loen Kingdom. Its natives were thin
and barbarians, but they were brave and skillful in warfare. A long
time ago, they posed as one of the biggest problems for the three
nations. But with the advancement of gunpowder, and the changes in
the way war was carried out, these highlanders eventually recognized
reality and submitted.
A large number of them left the highlands and entered Backlund,
Trier, Feynapotter City, and the various ﬂourishing cities or ports in
the Northern Continent. Some were workers, while others became
grunts of the local triads. They dared to kill and showed no fear of
thorny situations.
The conductor was a man in his twenties. He shrank back when he
heard that as he pointed in the direction of the third-class carriage.
“I saw him… He went that way.”
The leader, wearing a black coat and half top hat, nodded
indiscernibly. He led his men and rushed to the third-class carriage
and showed no concern towards the surrounding passengers.
If I were that boy, I would’ve already alighted from the third-class
carriage… As Klein read his newspaper, he began letting his thoughts
stray.
About a minute later, the train whistled as the carriage doors closed.
Chug! Chug! The steam metro began speeding up as it cruised along.
But at that moment, Klein suddenly sensed something as he looked
up to see the door leading to the other second-class carriages.
The teenage boy walked slowly into the carriage wearing his old coat
and round top hat while carrying a ragged haversack.
He looked adolescent and had reﬁned facial features. His red eyes
were staid and solemn.
… Impressive. He alighted from the third-class carriage and circled
around to enter from the ﬁrst-class carriage again? Was he afraid that his
pursuers had partners waiting inside the metro station? Klein was slightly
surprised. He felt that the boy’s handling of the situation was rather
mature and careful. He was much better than most people in their
twenties.
He clicked this left molar lightly and secretly activated his Spirit
Vision. He scanned the boy and saw that he was in a state of fatigue.
His emotions were tense and he was dispirited. However, he still
maintained a blueness that represented calm thinking.
Impressive… at his age… Klein mumbled silently as he lowered his
head and continued reading his papers.
The boy didn’t notice that he had been scrutinized by a Beyonder as
he headed for the third-class carriage once again.
The rest of the journey happened stably and calmly. Klein arrived
twenty minutes later at one of the three train stations in Cherwood
Borough.
He took a rented carriage for nearly ten minutes before ﬁnding Minsk
Street. According to the descriptions in the papers, he came to Unit
17 which was next to Unit 15 and pulled the doorbell.
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!
As sounds reverberated inside the house, a mechanical bird that
didn’t look too fancy popped out from above the door. It was about
the size of a palm and was made up of gears and other parts. It
constantly nodded its head and let out the sound of a cuckoo bird.
Not a bad toy. It’s just not very well-crafted… Klein made an objective
assessment.
Nearly twenty seconds later, the dark door was pulled open. A young
maidservant dressed in white and black looked warily at Klein and
asked, “May I help you?”
Klein smiled and waved his cane which was now wrapped with the
newspapers.
“I’m here to ﬁnd Mrs. Sammer about renting a house. I’m guessing it
hasn’t been rented out?”
The full name on the newspaper was Stelyn Sammer.
“Not at all. Please wait a moment.” The maidservant bent her back
politely.
She rushed inside and reported to her mistress. Moments later, she
came out again and ushered him in. She then helped him place his
cane and luggage in the foyer and hung his coat and hat on a clothes
rack in the same place.
A warm blast of air inundated him, dispersing the chill Klein had
brought in. He scanned the area and ﬁrst saw a uniquely designed
ﬁreplace. He saw pieces of red, smokeless charcoal burning inside.
Sammer’s living room was rather big. It was nearly equivalent to the
entire Moretti’s ﬁrst ﬂoor in area. Certain areas were decorated with
carpets or oil paintings of beautiful sceneries.
The maidservant brought Klein to the sofa and said to her mistress in
a pale yellow dress, “Madam, the guest is here.”
The mistress was in her thirties. She had blonde hair and blue eyes.
She looked rather pretty and had preserved her youthfulness well.
She held a silver-inlaid feathered royal fan in her hand.
As she was at home, and the ﬁreplace made for a warm environment,
she didn’t wear anything around her neck, revealing her white bosom
and shiny long neck.
“Hello there, Mrs. Sammer.” Klein pressed one palm to his chest and
bowed.
Mrs. Sammer smiled in a reserved manner.
“Good evening. Please, have a seat. Do you wish for some coﬀee or
tea?”
Klein sat on the sofa and answered frankly, “Tea, please.”
“Julianne, Marquis Black Tea,” Instructed Mrs. Sammer. She then
turned her eyes to Klein and asked, “How might I address you?”
“Sherlock Moriarty. You can call me Sherlock.” Klein had long
thought of a fake name.
At that moment, he caught a whiﬀ of a fragrance from the kitchen
and saw complicated pipes.
“Heh, heh, those are my husband’s designs. Although his actual job is
a manager at the Coim Company, he’s a machinery enthusiast. He’s
also a member of the Kingdom’s Soot Reduction Association.” Mrs.
Sammer noticed Klein’s gaze and explained with a smile.
Mrs, there’s no need to go into such detail. I’m not here on a blind date
with your husband… Klein lampooned as he said without his smile
waning, “Mrs. Sammer, I wish to rent the Unit 15.”
Mrs. Sammer straightened her back as she sat elegantly. She said
with a smile, “I have to remind you of certain things. Unit 15 doesn’t
have such pipes, reclining chairs, card tables, mahogany kitchen
cabinets, ﬁne porcelain, silver cutlery, gold-plated tea sets, or
removable carpets…”
She pointed at the things in her house as she introduced them, one
after another. After she was done, she added,
“It originally belonged to my elder sister and brother-in-law, but due
to a business failure, my brother-in-law had no choice but to move to
the Southern Continent. They have a plantation at Balam. However, I
don’t agree with their choice. This is just too unfair for my niece and
nephew. There are no good grammar schools there; not even a good
home tutor.”
Mrs, that’s not something I would like to know… Klein nodded sincerely
and said, “Apart from the weather, there’s no place in the Southern
Continent that can compare with Backlund.”
His agreement satisﬁed Mrs. Sammer greatly as her eyes darted
slightly.
“This house still has a three years lease. I wish for you to pay a year’s
rent at once. 18 soli a week. The use of the furniture will cost 1 soli. I
can collect a deposit of 50 pounds.”
Klein shook his head and smiled.
“Mrs. Sammer, you should be able to tell that I just arrived in
Backlund. I don’t know what will happen to me in time. To pay 50
pounds for a deposit will lower my ability to resist any risks. My limit
is half a year. 25 pounds.”
He still planned on renting another one-bedroom apartment in
Backlund’s East Borough. He would use it to change his clothes,
undergo disguises, and shirk oﬀ any tailing. It was necessary for what
he planned to do.
Stelyn Stelyn nodded slightly and asked, “Have you studied at
grammar school?”
Klein chuckled and said, “Yes, I later self-studied history.”
“Do you have any identiﬁcation with you?” asked Stelyn casually.
“I’m sorry. I was in a hurry when I left home and forgot to bring it
with me. Heh, heh, I forgot to introduce myself. I’m from
Midseashire.” Klein deliberately used the accent his classmate, Welch,
often used.
When he said “forgot,” it reminded him of Captain Dunn Smith. The
smile on his face turned even more brilliant.
At this moment, the maidservant, Julianne, brought a cup of black
tea over. The cup was porcelain-white with classic ﬂowery patterns.
Some areas were plated in gold.
Klein took a sip and found the fragrance distant. The mix of sourness
and sweetness were perfect, and it was clearly much better than the
Sibe black tea he often drank.
“Very authentic Marquis Black Tea.” He complimented with a
description which couldn’t be faulted.
Mrs. Stelyn Sammer curled her lips and said, “Then, let’s do half a
year’s rent. 25 pounds.”
Klein thanked her and engaged in a few minutes of idle chatter with
her until another maidservant found a service contract from the
study.
After both parties signed the contract, Klein counted 25 pounds while
feeling the pinch and pushed it to Mrs. Sammer.
Stelyn counted it silently before smiling.
“Mr. Moriarty, I believe you’ll be ﬁnding a job in Backlund?”
“Yes,” Klein answered, feeling a little lost.
The corners of Stelyn’s mouth hooked up.
“I can give you some suggestions. With a weekly salary lower than 3
pounds, it would be diﬃcult for you to live in Cherwood Borough.
Your rent, food expenses, water, gas, and charcoal expenses,
transport expenses, and everything else added up will cost at least 2
pounds 5 soli. Believe me, this is Backlund. One still has to consider
new clothes and good cutlery and tea sets… A weekly salary of 3
pounds is the bare minimum.
“If your weekly salary reaches 5 pounds, you can hire a maidservant.
At 6 pounds, you can consider hiring a chef. At 7 pounds, you can
add a male servant. For 8 pounds, you can hire an additional
maidservant…”
Mrs. Sammer, I think you are ﬂaunting your wealth… I once earned more
than 10 pounds a week… Klein maintained his smile as he listened
attentively.
At that moment, the door suddenly opened. A stout man walked in,
he was dressed in a black double-breasted suit and leather gloves of
the same color. Above his lips were two elegant mustaches.
“Luke, this is Mr. Moriarty. He will be our neighbor,” Stelyn Sammer
went forward and introduced him.
Obviously the master of the house, Luke took oﬀ his coat and handed
it to the male servant beside him. He smiled politely and said, “Mr.
Moriarty, would you like to join us for dinner?”
This is the manager of some Coim Company, a member of the Loen
Kingdom’s Soot Reduction Association… Klein said with a smile, “I’m
very sorry, Mr. Sammer. I’ve eaten on the steam locomotive;
although, that taste does leave a deep impression on one.”
After exchanging some pleasantries, Klein was led by Julianne out of
the house and into the neighboring Unit 15.
The layout was very similar to the unit next door. The ﬁrst ﬂoor had
a huge living room, a dining room with decent lighting, two guest
rooms, a bathroom, a cellar, a kitchen that extended all the way
back. On the second ﬂoor, there were four bedrooms, an activity
room, a solarium, a study, two bedrooms, and a huge balcony.
“Mrs. Sammer wishes to tell you that you can rent out part of it, but
not to workers or make this place too packed or noisy. Oh… I’ll bring
you clean blankets, sheets, and pillow cases in a while.” Julianne
returned to the Sammers after informing Klein.
After doing a round of packing, Klein ﬁnally settled into Backlund.
He sat in an empty living room and suddenly felt lonely. Hence, he
forced himself to consider his future plans.
Whether he liked it or not, revenge and advancement couldn’t be
done in the blink of an eye. Therefore, he had to obtain a lucrative
job to prevent himself from facing any ﬁnancial problems.
However, the job couldn’t restrict him and aﬀect his movements and
plans. In other words, he needed suﬃcient freedom.
After some deliberation and eliminating unsuitable jobs, Klein was
left with three choices.
He could become an author by becoming a plagiarist. However, his
identity was sensitive, so the more famous he became, the more
trouble it meant. All he could do was give up unwillingly.
The second choice was to be a news reporter. This was considered
quite a decent job in this time and age. However, job applications
required his educational certiﬁcates and other documents. Klein was
helpless in that respect.
Finally, he chose the third job.
Private detective!
This was also the reason why he had taken on a fake name.
Chapter 216: The Same-old
Gathering
Klein started his ﬁrst morning in Backlund under cold and humid
weather conditions, with a light fog that provided very little
visibility. For breakfast, he had one liter worth of cheap tea, costing
one penny, and two pieces of toast with inferior butter in the center.
He was busy the entire morning, but he ﬁrst went to the Cherwood
Borough’s Backlund Bulletin to post a tiny advertisement for a month
at the cost of thirty pounds.
From Tuesday, the Backlund Bulletin’s loyal readers would see a tiny
advertisement along the seams of its seventh and eighth page.
Sherlock Moriarty. Good at various types of private investigations.
Reasonable prices and strictly adheres to the principles of conﬁdentiality.
Resides at Cherwood Borough’s 15 Minsk Street.
The reason why Klein didn’t choose major newspapers like the
Tussock Times or the Backlund Daily Tribune, that had a readership
all across the entirety of the Loen Kingdom, was due to the fact that
his business was temporarily limited to Backlund. Furthermore, he
didn’t wish for a sterling reputation.
Therefore, the Backlund Bulletin, which was well-received locally and
had low advertisement fees, became his ﬁrst choice.
After leaving the Backlund Bulletin’s headquarters, Klein took out a
map and followed it to purchase various herb powders and silver
slices from various herbal stores, ﬂower stores, jewelry stores, and
accessory stores. He did it in preparation for holding a ritual. When
items that didn’t have any spirituality were involved, most of the
materials in mysticism could be purchased from ordinary stores.
However, they weren’t all under one roof, requiring him to visit
many stores to collect them.
To do so, Klein spent another 5 pounds. The humongous sum of 200
pounds that he withdrew broke below the 100 pound mark, leaving
him only with 92 pounds.
“Spending money is as easy as drinking water…” Klein found a small
cafeteria nearby and ordered a black pepper steak worth 8 pence.
He returned to 15 Minsk Street at one in the afternoon, and without
rest, he spent his time using Slumber ﬂower, dragon blood grass, dark
red sandalwood, and mint powders to create Holy Night Powder, a
key ingredient needed to create a wall of spirituality.
He could only make do with this method until he bought a real silver
ritual dagger.
Klein speculated that he would have to advance to Sequence 7 before
he could do away with this restriction.
Phew, Miss Justice, Mr. Hanged Man, and The Sun haven’t requested for
leave yet. The gathering will be held on time today… I wonder what
surprises Mr. Hanged Man will bring me, and how many pages of Roselle’s
diary he can provide… Klein laid back on his bed in the bedroom and
thought about all sorts of things.
To him, a private detective was a career that took into account both
money and action. It allowed him to get in touch with people from
all walks of life and slowly discover the Beyonder circle in Backlund.
From there, he could slowly ﬁnd clues regarding the Secret Order.
Of course, if he was lucky, he would even be able to ﬁgure out the
Sequence 7 which corresponded to the Clown through a particular
circle of Beyonders and buy the corresponding potion formula and
main ingredients.
As for Ince Zangwill’s whereabouts, Klein temporarily chose not to
take the initiative to seek him out. He might even avoid him a little.
However, if he were to accidentally discover this enemy of his,
without exposing himself, he wouldn’t mind doing a good deed and
sending an anonymous letter to the Church of the Evernight Goddess.
A private detective’s income can, at most, support a middle-class standard
of living. If I want enough money to buy the potion formula and Beyonder
materials, It will either depend on Miss Justice, or it will be through
investments with the remaining 100 pounds that I have left in my
anonymous account… Yes, I can’t touch the 92 pounds that I have for the
time being. Perhaps, I wouldn’t be having any income for some time…
With this in mind, Klein suddenly sat up. He came to the ﬁrst ﬂoor
and began reading the various newspapers he bought in passing.
These newspapers often carried news about what had been invented
and required investments, or how someone wished to form a joint
venture with others to do a particular business.
Klein relied on his knowledge from Earth and his understanding of
this era to carefully sift through the projects. Unfortunately, none of
the ones on the papers today were reliable.
At ﬁfteen minutes to three, he returned to his bedroom, locked the
door, drew the curtains, and used Holy Night Powder to create a wall
of spirituality.
Klein took four steps counterclockwise and arrived above the gray
fog. He sat in the high-back chair belonging to The Fool before
extending his spirituality and touching the crimson star that
symbolized The Sun as if he was responding to a prayer.
This is one of the few things in my new life that hasn’t changed… he
suddenly sighed.
…
In an area outside of the City of Silver, in a grayish-black tower that
was half-collapsed.
Nine members of a patrol squad were gathered around a blazing
bonﬁre, chatting about their experiences in the past few days.
There were also a few other team members guarding the perimeter,
prepared for any possible attacks that might break out from the
darkness.
Many of the City of Silver’s Beyonders had used their blood to teach
them a lesson:
“At all times, never let your guard down. The monsters in the darkness
could very well be right behind you!”
On a night when the frequency of lightning was very low, it was
necessary to keep the ﬂames burning and the light shining. Once they
were completely enveloped in darkness, it wasn’t impossible for them
to all disappear—no one could say for sure just what terrible things
would happen in total darkness, because reality had broken the limits
of their imagination time and time again.
Derrick Berg remained reserved and silent as he quietly listened to
his companions reminiscing about the monster they had encountered
before. It was a humanoid monster with eyes covering its entire body.
In order to ﬁnish oﬀ the monster, their patrolling team suﬀered a
heavy price with ﬁve injured, and two of them severely injured.
Suddenly, Derrick’s vision blurred, and he felt himself being
enveloped in a thick gray mist.
In an inexplicably faraway place, in the depths of the gray fog, a
blurry ﬁgure sat on an ancient high-back chair, looking down at him.
“Prepare for the gathering.”
The Fool’s voice echoed in Derrick’s ears, but none of his teammates
were aware of it.
After withdrawing his gaze and observing the area for more than ten
seconds, Derrick moved to the very edge of the ﬁre, leaned against
the broken wall, and pretended to be asleep.
Ever since he found out that the members of the six-member council
and Elder Lovia were unable to discover the existence of Mr. Fool, he
gradually believed that as long as he didn’t carelessly reveal any
clues, he would be able to quietly attend the Tarot Club’s gathering
above the gray fog even under the gaze of others.
…
Backlund, Empress Borough.
Using the excuse that she was tired, Audrey returned to her bedroom.
She curbed her excitement and didn’t pace back and forth; instead,
she sat quietly on the bed, waiting for Mr. Fool’s summoning.
Father was busy communicating with the other Members of Parliament
about the proposed bill, and the Beyonder guard isn’t tailing me
constantly. Thank you Goddess; my life has ﬁnally returned to normal!
Two weeks have passed, Mr. Hanged Man must’ve prepared the pituitary
gland of a mature Rainbow Salamander… I’m about to advance to
Sequence 8! Audrey thought with sparkling eyes.
To her, this was even more exciting and worth looking forward to
than the thirty thousand pound bounty and the large plantation
worth at least 8,000 pounds!
Finally, she saw the familiar illusory crimson surge towards her like a
tidal wave, drowning her.
…
On an ancient-looking sailboat.
Alger Wilson locked the door to the captain’s cabin and sat behind a
sextant and the ship logs. He kept memorizing the contents of the
thick stack of sheets in front of him.
After the investigations, he left the bustle of Backlund without any
qualms after being rewarded by the upper echelons and returned to
the sea, carrying a batch of secretly copied Roselle diary pages.
After digesting the Seafarer potion, I’ll be able to advance normally. My
contributions are enough for me to trade for the formula and
ingredients… However, this will expose the fact that I know the “acting
method.” There are advantages and disadvantages… Alger shook his
head, suddenly distracted.
At that moment, he felt the summoning of The Fool. His mind
suddenly recalled the face of Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos whose
ﬂesh and blood quickly rotted as pieces of his face peeled oﬀ.
Alger instinctively lowered his head, allowing the crimson tide to
engulf him.
…
Above the gray fog, inside the palace that looked like a giant’s
residence.
Having activated his Spirit Vision, Klein examined Justice, The
Hanged Man, and The Sun to conﬁrm their current states.
Audrey was about to happily greet everyone when she suddenly saw
The Hanged Man gesturing to her before rushing to speak before her.
“Mr. Fool, I’ve obtained nineteen pages of Roselle’s diary this time.
“Here, I must thank you for sending your adorer to help me get rid of
Qilangos. These diary pages will be the compensation I should pay!”
19 pages? Not bad… Klein didn’t talk much about the adorer as he
smiled faintly.
“That is the principle of equivalent exchange.”
As expected of Mr. Fool… A Pirate Admiral with a mystical item was
nothing to “Him”… From the looks of it, I don’t have to mention my
claiming of the bounty… I wonder how many High-Sequence Beyonders
Mr. Fool has as “His” adorers…Audrey had begun to use the word
“He,” “Him,” or “His” to refer to The Fool without realizing it.
Upon hearing The Fool’s answer, Alger said humbly, “The limit of my
current memory is six pages. Please allow me to give them to you
over separate occasions.”
“No problem.” Klein, who was surrounded by thick gray fog, nodded
gently.
The Sun Derrick looked at the pages that appeared before The
Hanged Man and was very curious about the contents of the diary.
With his previous experiences, he believed that the items that Mr.
Fool was interested in deﬁnitely contained many mysteries.
He looked at Miss Justice and when he saw that she didn’t have the
impulse to ask, he cautiously maintained his silence.
Soon, the six pages of the diary were complete and came into Klein’s
hands.
Audrey and the others began to wait quietly. They were already used
to such things.
Klein looked down and read the ﬁrst page:
“16th December. I managed to contact the pathetic fellow who’s
trapped in the storm and was lost in the darkness.”
Finally, there’s a follow-up to one of the previous pages of the diary…
Klein was delighted, and he became more focused:
“He called himself Mr. Door and tried to teach me a complicated and
diﬃcult ritual. He wanted me to help him return to the real world
and promised to fulﬁll three of my requests.
“Does he think I’m stupid? I’ve lived for more than sixty years over
my two lives. Does he think I can’t tell that this is the usual
manipulation done by evil gods and devils?
“But the history of the Fourth Epoch that he described was truly
interesting.”
Chapter 217: Mr. Door's
Description
Mr. Door… This naming style is very similar to mine… I wonder what
was the real name of this pathetic fellow who was lost and trapped in the
deep darkness amidst the storms is, and what his Sequence is. Or rather,
just as Emperor Roselle had guessed, he’s one of the evil gods or devils…
Klein let out a silent chuckle which was mixed with ridicule and self-
deprecating humor. He was also interested in the history of the
Fourth Epoch.
“I know of the most famous ‘War of the Four Emperors’ in the Fourth
Epoch, but the speciﬁc details and the main ﬁgures involved are
limited to the information spread by the major Churches. For
example, the ‘Dark Emperor’ of the Solomon Empire.
“It wasn’t until today that this so-called Mr. Door ﬁnally answered
my questions by letting me know who the remaining three emperors
are. The half-insane Blood Emperor of the Tudor Dynasty, the Night
Emperor of the Trunsoest Empire, and the Emperor of the
Underworld of the Southern Continent, also known as Death.
“According to Mr. Door’s description, in this war that changed the
situation of the entire world, the Dark Emperor, Blood Emperor and
Night Emperor fell one after another. The Emperor of the Underworld
reaped the greatest beneﬁts.
“Having said that, Mr. Door added with profound signiﬁcance that
after over a century of ‘digestion,’ Death went mad, but he also
became stronger. Therefore, Death teamed up with the Primordial
Demoness and brought about a Pale Disaster for the Northern
Continent. Of course, this isn’t something he witnessed personally,
but rather something that he hears when he comes close to the real
world every month.
“Death went mad, but also became stronger!
“Even deities can go mad?
“What a horrifying sentence!
“However, this also conﬁrms my guess. Before the Fifth Epoch, those
deities would often descend into the real world, directly interfering
with the situation in the Northern and Southern Continents. They
might even personally appear just like Death.
“I asked Mr. Door if he had participated in the ‘War of the Four
Emperors’? If so, what role did he play? And what was the position
the seven deities maintained in this war? What role did they play?
“Mr. Door didn’t answer my question. He only said in a teasing
manner that the number of pre-eminent mighty ﬁgures in the Fourth
Epoch far exceeds my imagination.
“In addition, he also mentioned two laws, one is the Law of Beyonder
Characteristics Indestructibility, and the other is the Law of Similar
Sequence Beyonder Characteristics Conservation, which is consistent
with certain things that I have learned from that most secret and
ancient organization, and also from some of the phenomena I have
observed. Heh, this can lead to many interesting conclusions, making
many explanations take on other forms, making one’s mind tremble
in horror. For example, when there are too many High-Sequence
Beyonders in the same Sequence pathway, the Low-Sequence
Beyonders would reduce, and vice-versa.
“… The Beyonder Characteristics had been ﬁxed at the source. It will
not increase or decrease. Does this mean that there really is a God
who created all the deities, an omnipotent and omniscient God, and
everything originated from Him?”
This was the longest Roselle diary that Klein had ever seen. It took up
two full pages, and one could imagine that it originally came on a
double-sided page. It only became two separate pages after repeated
copying.
That’s a lot of information… Klein sighed silently.
As a history student who had graduated normally, he had always
believed that the Solomon Empire, the Tudor Dynasty, and the
Trunsoest Empire came one after the other in a line, with a certain
degree of restoration before a new political outcome was established.
To his surprise, the War of the Four Emperors described by Mr. Door
clearly and unambiguously revealed one thing—all three empires had
existed at the same time!
If this were true, then it would really overturn most of the current
research on the Fourth Epoch in the ﬁeld of history. Klein suddenly
thought of the original Klein, who was ﬁlled with interest towards
archeology and the history regarding the Fourth Epoch.
Today, I’ve helped him achieve his wish… I wonder if Death had already
become a true deity during the War of the Four Emperors. It’s hard to
determine according to Mr. Door’s descriptions. I can only ﬁrst assume
that the Emperor of the Underworld, who had obtained beneﬁts from the
War of the Four Emperors, had broken through his limits and become a
deity, but “He” also went mad as a result…
To have a deity go mad was truly terrifying. Just thinking about the
details makes one tremble from the bottom of their heart! It’s no wonder
that the knowledgeable Emperor Roselle would use the word “horrifying”
to describe this matter…
Could it be that the so-called evil gods were crazy orthodox deities?
Would that mean that there might only be evil gods left in this world one
day…
Man, does this mean that the end of days cannot be stopped?
Klein smiled to hide the growing solemnity of his emotions. He felt
that the future he imagined was ﬁlled with a dark gray hue.
At the same time, he raised his evaluation of the Dark Emperor,
Blood Emperor, and Night Emperor, believing them to be the pre-
eminent mighty ﬁgures who were close to being deities.
Perhaps that means Sequence 1 is the peak existence of a single pathway.
According to this logic, for Dark Emperor to live for centuries or over a
millennium wouldn’t be unacceptable. That would explain the original
Klein’s confusion. He had obtained contradictory ﬁndings from the
content recorded in the Antigonus family’s notebook with his own mentor’s
viewpoint. He believed that the Dark Emperor was the common name used
by every emperor of the Solomon Empire… Perhaps, the Dark Emperor
had always been the same Dark Emperor… Of course, other possibilities
cannot be eliminated. For example, they could’ve been replaced two or
three times, but is the name of that pathway’s Sequence 1, Dark Emperor?
I wonder who Mr. Door is in the history of the Fourth Epoch… Emperor
Roselle didn’t go into detail when describing his erroneous experiments
and accidental coincidences, making it impossible for me to even try to
converse with that Mr. Door.
The Laws of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility and Similar
Sequence Beyonder Characteristics Conservation shares the same
description as the one used by the Captain. Perhaps, the term he used
came from Emperor Roselle.
According to the two laws described by Mr. Gate, we can indeed deduce a
lot of interesting speculations. For example, with there being so many holy
artifacts and High-Sequence Beyonders in the Seven Churches, there
shouldn’t be many Low-Sequence Beyonders. But this contradicts reality,
and the only reasonable explanation is an additional gift from the deities?
For example, is the destruction of the Nation of the Evernight due to the
Conservation of Characteristics, that the mere possession of resources
causes it to be in trouble? Or could it be said that their existence seriously
weakens the potency of the Evernight pathway and threatens the position
of the Goddess?
For example, theoretically speaking, certain Sealed Artifacts could also be
used as the main ingredients for potion materials, or they can even be
considered equivalent to potions. Of course, the prerequisite is to remove
all latent dangers and madness.
…
No wonder the documents that were unearthed called the Fourth Epoch,
“the Epoch of the Gods.” So it turns out that in this epoch, there are many
records of deities descending.
Then what caused them to stop coming, to the point of there not being any
revelations?
If it wasn’t for the fact that Beyonders receive responses from ritualistic
magic, perhaps many of them would’ve doubted the existence of the
deities…
Many ideas came to Klein suddenly as he felt that he had delved
deeper into the realm of mysticism in this Beyonder world.
He ﬂipped through the next four pages and was disappointed to
realize that they were no longer related to Mr. Door.
His ability as a Clown allowed him to conceal his emotions well, and
coupled with the gray fog’s obstruction, even Audrey, who was
secretly observing him, didn’t notice anything amiss.
He gathered his chaotic thoughts and started reading the third page
of the diary:
“10th September. I’ve endured it for a long time, but I still can’t help
but complain a little.
“I must’ve had f**king sh*t for brains to chose the Savant path, right?
“Of course, this has indeed allowed me to develop my greatest
advantage, allowing the Church to attach great importance to me.
But the problem is that the ﬁrst few Sequences lack any Beyonder
powers needed for combat. I can only make do by relying on mystical
items and rely way too much on external items.
“For example, Sequence 9 Savant only has extraordinary abilities in
memory, learning, and practical skills. For example, Sequence 8
Archaeologist gains a strong physique and corresponding ancient
knowledge, and they can only barely apply some ritualistic magic.
For example, Sequence 7 Appraiser, whose ability is to quickly
identify mystical objects, allowing them to avoid hidden dangers to
the greatest extent. For example, Sequence 6 Artisan, who can
produce machinery wonder but not very powerful Beyonder objects.
Apart from that, one’s standard in ritualistic magic will be enhanced.
It’s no wonder its modern name is Machinery Specialist.
“Comparatively speaking, the Sequence 7 Warlock and Sequence 6
Scrolls Professor of the Mystery Pryer pathway are suﬃciently
tempting. It would be great if only the Church has the complete
Sequence and that the Hidden Sage doesn’t exist.
“However, I ﬁnally received some good news. After I advance again,
I’ll gain Beyonder powers combat powers that I can call my own.
Sequence 5 Astromancer!
“Its modern name scares me a little. It’s actually called Astronomer…
“Am I going to end up as an all-powerful mad scientist?
“Heavens have mercy on me. I was only a second-tier student at the
college entrance examination!
It had to be said that Emperor Roselle had a strange talent for making
jokes. Even the recently dispirited Klein couldn’t help but twitch his
mouth, wishing to light a candle for this senior.
Study hard and improve by the day is indeed a wise saying… He
lampooned and remembered the unique trait of the Church of the
God of Steam and Machinery.
They lacked Beyonder powers when it came to combat, but they were
good at making and using items.
After ﬂipping to the third page of the diary, Klein continued reading.
“2nd June, the kingdom has created chaos, again and again,
instigating wars without being able to completely destroy the Feysac
Empire, the Loen Kingdom, and the Feynapotter Kingdom. As such,
the kingdom has no choice but to shoulder huge debts, and its
economy is on the verge of collapse.
“From my observations, the people, merchants, and soldiers are very
dissatisﬁed. The riots are just lacking a spark! This is my chance.
“But I have to be very careful. The Sauron family has witnessed the
history of the Fourth Epoch and is an ancient family with a high
possibility of having High-Sequence Beyonders. I need the support of
the Church, as well as gain a tacit agreement with the Church of the
Eternal Blazing Sun.
“I can’t appear immediately. First, I’ll let the rebels destroy order
before I end it all as a protector. Consul Roselle Gustav. I like that
name.”
Chapter 218: Free General
Knowledge
“June 3rd. After discussing with Edwards and the others, I gave up on
the idea of reaching a tacit understanding with the Church of the
Eternal Blazing Sun. This might very well reveal my true intentions,
making the Sauron family and the ancient nobles who support them
aware of them in advance and carry out a direct approach. That
would make matters extremely diﬃcult and dangerous.
“It’s a pity that Grimm died in the Sea of Fog. He was the smartest
among us.
“Descend into chaos! Descend! Only with everything in chaos will I
get the chance to ﬁsh in troubled waters! Only when the Sauron
family is incapable of handling this situation will the Church of the
Eternal Blazing Sun reluctantly acknowledge me!
“Perhaps I should give some help to those rebels, but how should I
conceal myself so that no one would notice?
“June 4th, Zaratul from the Secret Order came to visit me in
incognito very suddenly.”
…
And then? Klein was just feeling intrigued over the reason why
Zaratul—leader of the Secret Order—would seek Roselle on the eve
of the rebellion and coup d’état when he realized that the two
subsequent pages had nothing to do with it.
This made him feel a sense of irrepressible anger.
Although the three diary pages didn’t provide very detailed
descriptions, with rather straightforward accounts from Roselle, Klein
could still feel the famous turmoil in Intis that happened in 1173,
more than a hundred years ago.
The outcome was clearly recorded in history textbooks. As a colonel,
Republic quashed the rebellion and enacted political changes. The
Intis Kingdom was transformed into a republic, with him acting as a
self-appointed consul.
In the following 19 years, he reformed the penal code, encouraged
inventions, and protected the industrial revolution. He greatly
increased the country’s strength and fought wars both north and
south, making Lenburg, Masin, Segar, and other countries
protectorates under the Intis Republic. He also made the three mighty
countries on the Northern Continent—the Feysac Empire, the Loen
Kingdom, and the Feynapotter Kingdom—bow their heads.
At the end of 1192, almost twenty years after his appointment as
consul, Roselle converted the Republic into an Empire, declaring
himself Caesar.
Less than six years later, he perished in the White Maple Palace,
ending the Fifth Epoch’s most legendary piece of history to date.
The more he thought about it, the more he felt that there was more
to Roselle’s death than what appeared on the surface. It was just like
how this famous historical event deﬁnitely had power struggles
amongst Beyonders behind it, and that a Beyonder faction had
leveled the situation, unlike the descriptions in textbooks.
As expected, one of the so-called Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,
Grimm, died in the Sea of Fog… In a previous diary page, Roselle had
written that there was something wrong with this ‘horseman.’ It seems to
have something to do with the tiny island where they discovered many
extraordinary beings… Not only was it a fortuitous encounter, but it was
also a dangerous one… Klein thought of a previous entry and turned
to the ﬁfth page, feeling emotional.
The contents of this page are of little value. They consist of Roselle’s
comments after drinking an 1128 Aurmir red wine, the disillusion of
ﬁnding the woman who had gained his adoration in his youth to be aged
and out of shape, as well as a degenerate summary of a certain period
when he was addicted to playing cards.
The sixth page was about the same as the ﬁrst one, with accounts of
his daily life. However, the last one made Klein’s eyes light up.
“8th April, I have to send someone to investigate the Secret Order to
get more information. I can’t repeat my passiveness from before. I
can’t let Zaratul lead me by the nose anymore.”
So, did you discover anything, Comrade Roselle? Since Klein couldn’t
ﬁnd the rest of the information, he could only force himself to calm
down and wait for the next gathering when The Hanged Man would
hand over another six pages.
He knew that an investigation from over a hundred years ago was
unlikely to help him ﬁnd any clues related to the Secret Order
Association. After all, over such a long period of time, other than the
special ones, many of the High-Sequence Beyonders would’ve already
died of old age, not to mention the middle or low-level members.
However, Klein believed that this would help him obtain inspiration
and grasp the precise identity and activity patterns that the Secret
Order often used.
Putting down the six diary pages, Klein tapped his right index ﬁnger
on the edge of the long bronze table, slowly moving his gaze from
Miss Justice to The Hanged Man, and then to The Sun.
Right, in the diary just now, there was a line Emperor Roselle described:
“God who created all the deities, an omnipotent and omniscient God” This
is very similar to the customs of the City of Silver. Where did he hear this
from? Could it be from that most ancient and secret organization which
controls the world from behind the scenes? This organization was
established before the Forsaken Land of the Gods was forsaken?
Hmm… Suddenly, Klein had a new idea. He said with a low and
gentle smile, “Roselle mentioned some hidden history in his diary,
and mentioned some simple general knowledge. The latter reminded
me of something that I don’t recall informing you all.”
Audrey suddenly fell into a trance. She immediately turned her body
around and looked at the very top of the ancient long table in
pleasant surprise.
Mr. Fool is taking the initiative to mention the contents of Roselle’s diary?
What would it say? She was so excited and thrilled that she
completely forgot that she was a Spectator.
Compared to her, The Hanged Man, Alger, was much more
composed. However, the subconscious straightening of his back
heartlessly betrayed him.
Only The Sun, Derek, had always believed that the items of interest
to Mr. Fool contained many mysteries, but he didn’t know anything
about Emperor Roselle and didn’t know what this name represented
in the Northern Continent. Thus, he just found it diﬃcult to hide his
curiosity and didn’t reveal any unusual behavior.
“Mr. Fool, did Emperor Roselle mention some general knowledge?
I’m willing to pay for this information,” Audrey couldn’t help but say.
However, I want it to be communicated to me privately! She added
silently in her heart.
Klein chuckled and said, “There’s no need. This is very simple general
knowledge.”
“After reading this part of the diary, as the summoner of the Tarot
Club, I feel it’s necessary to let all of you know this. Of course, I’m
very certain that some of you are already aware of this.”
He was mainly referring to The Sun. The City of Silver had a history
of two to three thousand years, so it was impossible for them to not
discover the Law of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility.
Moreover, they were in a relatively extreme environment. Even if the
surrounding areas had no lack of monsters in the darkness, there
would still be times when they failed to obtain the corresponding
materials. In order to pass on their heritage, in order for their city to
continue on, using the Beyonder Characteristics of the remains of
their predecessors to create a potion wasn’t particularly unacceptable.
To them, this was perhaps a sacred and glorious ceremony.
Of course, Klein could see from a previous exchange that The Hanged
Man knew something.
It’s a pity that Miss Justice cannot always be made to pay in gold pounds
and transfer the money to my adorers. My adorer can’t appear any less
impressive… I mustn’t destroy the image of the powerful man that Mr.
Azik has created… Yes, I’ll give it a try when I have the chance. After all,
no matter how powerful a being is, they’ll have subordinates that run
errands. For instance, the Evernight Goddess’s Sleepless… No one would
ever suspect that the Evernight Goddess isn’t a true deity just because the
low-level Nighthawks are weak… Klein sighed silently.
“Thank you very much! Mr. Fool, you are just too generous!” Audrey
replied in joy.
She was originally feeling three seconds of regret for the coarse
action of using cash to purchase the information.
Klein stopped rapping the table and described with a calm voice,
“The ﬁrst piece of general knowledge—Law of Beyonder
Characteristics Indestructibility. The characteristics of a Beyonder is
never destroyed or reduced. It’s only passed from one carrier to the
next.”
Without realizing it, I used Captain’s tone… Klein’s lips subconsciously
curled upwards.
It cannot be destroyed or reduced. It just transfers from one carrier to
another…Audrey ruminated over Mr. Fool’s description, feeling that
there was too much meaning in that simple sentence.
Her emerald green eyes turned, and when she saw that neither The
Hanged Man nor The Sun showed any signs of surprise or
contemplation, she immediately understood that these two members
of the Tarot Club had long known of this law.
Only I didn’t know… She thought, feeling somewhat aggrieved, but
she quickly began to praise Mr. Fool for his kindness.
At this point, Klein added, “After a Rampager dies, they will leave
behind an item of Beyonder Characteristics. It could be the main
ingredient, or it could be a mystical artifact that requires sealing. An
ordinary Beyonder’s death results in similar results. However, the
item left behind will be equivalent to the corresponding potion
without the supplementary ingredients. Of course, the item alone will
contain Beyonder powers. They can be used as a half-mystical
object.”
The plain and indiﬀerent words instantly echoed in Audrey’s mind.
Layers stacked upon layers and, bit by bit, it eventually reached a
crescendo.
Audrey thought of cannibalism and the question—would a Sequence
pathway be severed if the source of Beyonder materials ceased to
exist— she had asked The Hanged Man previously came to mind.
Now, she knew the answer, but she would’ve rather not heard it. She
felt like she was having a nightmare!
How can it be so cruel? Why is it so dark? Audrey had previously seen
some bad situations that involved Beyonders, but those situations
were only caused by a person’s own perverse and evil nature. For
example, Mr. A or Qilangos. They didn’t aﬀect her yearning and love
for mysticism and the Beyonder world.
However, this time, she discovered that the mystical world was ﬁlled
with grayness and darkness.
Wake up, Audrey, you can’t be naive! Consider that the cruelty and
darkness described by Mr. Fool are predictable. Since he had chosen this
path, he had to bravely walk down it! Audrey consoled herself, easing
her mood a little.
She saw that The Hanged Man and the Sun were making only
habitual movements and appeared to understand what had just been
said.
Hmph! Mr. Hanged Man is terrible. He even wanted to use this
information as an exchange previously! Ugh… This information is indeed
worth a lot and is quite important, but it’s only a simple piece of general
knowledge to us and Mr. Fool…Audrey suddenly wanted to laugh a
little. Her mood began to improve, and she slowly pushed all the
extreme examples that she had just thought of aside.
Klein wasn’t surprised by the three members’ reaction. He continued
in a calm tone, “The second piece of general knowledge—Law of
Similar Sequence Beyonder Characteristics Conservation.”
Law of Similar Sequence Beyonder Characteristics Conservation… The
Hanged Man slightly changed his sitting posture. He felt that he
understood something, but he was unable to fully understand what
this law represented and what it consisted of.
Justice and The Sun shared the same feelings as he did. They were
unable to directly understand the true meaning behind this law.
“Why Similar Sequence?” Alger couldn’t help asking.
Klein smiled and replied, “What do you wish to pay for the answer?”
One of the ideas he had was that general knowledge was free, but
any explanation required a fee. This both matched his status and
didn’t waste the information.
Free things cost the most.
Chapter 219: Explanation
If The Fool had simply mentioned that there was some simple general
knowledge contained in Roselle’s diary, The Hanged Man, Alger,
wouldn’t necessarily be determined to pay the “price” for the answer,
partly because the description of it being “simple” killed his curiosity.
Another aspect stemmed from his constant wariness against making
trades with The Fool, as it reminded him of the examples when deals
were made with evil gods and devils.
But now that he knew the so-called contents of simple general
knowledge, his interest was piqued. Yet, he was unable to understand
parts of the description, much less gain any actual or deep grasp of
the concept. Therefore, he couldn’t hold back his urges to ask in
absolute reverence, “Mr. Fool, what kind of payment do you want?”
“Yes, yes!” Justice Audrey nodded her head nearly indiscernibly but
very frequently, indicating that this was something she wanted to ask
as well.
Although The Sun Derrick remained silent and didn’t make any
additional body gestures, the look he gave to The Fool explained
everything.
Klein, who was waiting for a such a response, smiled and said,
“Information regarding the Secret Order.”
“The Secret Order…” The Hanged Man Alger muttered to himself.
He wasn’t unfamiliar with this term. He had once received payment
for explaining to Miss Justice about many secret organizations,
including the Secret Order.
Audrey and Derrick both frowned subconsciously. The former’s only
understanding of the Secret Order was limited to what The Hanged
Man had described. And the latter had never even heard of such an
organization.
Klein had long anticipated what The Sun would feel, but he wasn’t
surprised. According to his conjecture, the area where the City of
Silver was located should’ve been a part of the Third Epoch after the
appearance of the ﬁrst Blasphemy Slate and before the appearance of
the second Blasphemy Slate. It was even possible that it was the
direct catalyst or manifestation of the cataclysm. The Zaratul family
had only stepped onto the stage of history in the Fourth Epoch, and
the Secret Order was created in the latter half of the Fourth Epoch.
There was no way both entities could’ve existed in the same period.
It would surprise Klein if the Sun were to know about the Secret
Order. He would then have to overturn some of his speculations,
reconstruct his knowledge of the City of Silver, the Forsaken Land of
the Gods, and the Zaratul family.
After nearly twenty seconds of silence, Alger looked at The Fool in
the gray fog, deliberated his words and said, “I will accept this
request and help you gather information regarding the Secret Order.
“Can you make ‘payment’ in advance?”
It wasn’t surprising that a suspected deity was interested in an
ancient and secret organization; therefore, Alger wasn’t puzzled
about it.
More importantly, after many gatherings, he had a guess in his mind,
which was that Mr. Fool’s state wasn’t perfect, that “He” might be in
a predicament, that all “His” attempts and the actions of “His”
adorers on the Northern and Southern Continents were to help “Him”
break free from “His” conﬁnes.
This might even be related to the huge secret of why the seven deities no
longer descend upon the real world after the Fourth Epoch… A thought
ﬂashed through Alger’s mind, and he shuddered as he felt himself
entering the realm of the gods.
Upon hearing The Hanged Man’s request, Klein leaned back in his
chair and nodded.
“No problem.
“If the information you have collected exceeds the value of the
answer, I will provide you with further compensation.”
As for the circumstances in which the value of the answer was lacking, it
is naturally up to the esteemed Mr. Fool to decide. If he has the ability to
make the additional payment, so be it. If not, forget it… Klein silently
added.
Justice Audrey’s eyes lit up all of a sudden. She raised her hand and
said, “I want to partake in this deal.”
Klein laughed and replied, “Sure.”
Frankly speaking, his main target was Miss Justice because she was a
local of Backlund and she had mixed herself into several Beyonder
circles. Her access to information in the “Land of Hope” far exceeded
his, considering it was his ﬁrst time in the capital. She was also more
informed than The Hanged Man who was out at sea most of the time.
According to the earlier revelation he received from his divination,
Klein believed that the clues related to the Secret Order would appear
in Backlund and not anywhere else.
The Sun Derrick listened quietly and after some thought, said, “I’m
willing to use the payment I reserved and exchange it for the
answer.”
In the previous three-way deal, he had traded the Sequence 8
Telepathist formula for Sequence 9 Bard. Klein had promised to
compensate him, and his choice at the time had been to save it up
and prepare for the subsequent potion formulas and main
ingredients.
Klein nodded his head and gave an explanation that he had long
prepared.
“The so-called Similar Sequence refers to how High-Sequence
Beyonders are exchangeable with other pathways.
“Let me give an example. The Death pathway’s Sequence 5,
Gatekeeper, can not only be advanced normally, but one can also
choose the Giant pathway, which is the Gatekeeper pathway’s
Sequence 4, Demon Hunter.
“This won’t lead to the danger of losing control, nor will it
accumulate madness. It’s diﬀerent from taking the wrong potion.
“Of course, if it’s not a similar Sequence, a semi-deranged state is the
best result.”
“Exchangeable?” Audrey blurted out, surprised and delighted.
She was surprised that Sequence pathways weren’t completely ﬁxed,
that they didn’t need to follow the original path all the way. The
price of switching wasn’t being semi-deranged and never to advance
again. Within the 22 divine pathways, there were special
circumstances and Sequences which were similar!
And what delighted her was that she had another chance to choose
again in the future. It was just like being able to select something that
caught her interest at Philip’s Department Store. It was a wonderful
experience!
So that’s how it is… Alger silently muttered to himself, suddenly
feeling like he had understood several things at once, and he had
resolved many of the doubts accumulated in his past experiences.
This information is way too valuable! As expected of Mr. Fool. So-called
simple general knowledge is enough to shock and awe most Low-Sequence
Beyonders and beneﬁt them immensely. He sighed inwardly.
Derrick the Sun was a little disappointed because he had no intention
of changing Sequences. He wanted to be the Sun that lit up the
darkness and dispelled the curse.
However, he quickly recalled an incident that happened in the City of
Silver:
The former Chief, a powerhouse who had the greatest possibility of
breaking past the limitations of Demon Hunter, had built a
mausoleum for himself and went deep inside, making it his home.
Afterwards, he appeared less and less, until the main door of the
mausoleum could no longer be opened.
Back then, the citizens of the City of Silver all believed that a
problem had arisen during the Chief’s advancement and that he had
gone mad, to the point of being close to losing control. He was
believed to have ﬁnished himself oﬀ.
Now, combined with the description from The Fool, The Sun
suddenly thought of another possibility.
That Chief might’ve been attempting to advance in Sequence through a
similar pathway!
In one of his explorations deep into the darkness, he had acquired the
corresponding formula for the Death pathway, and the mausoleum might
have been a special requirement… But in the end, he still failed? But why
didn’t he turn into a monster? What did he encounter in that dark
mausoleum?
The City of Silver doesn’t have the subsequence Sequence potion formulas
after Demon Hunter?
As these thoughts crossed his mind, Derrick was suddenly jolted back
to his senses by Miss Justice’s reserved voice.
“Mr. Fool, may I ask what other pathways are exchangeable with the
Spectator Sequencer pathway?”
Sequence 4 Demon Hunter sounds pretty good… That’s very suitable for
me, very suitable for ‘Justice!’ Audrey admired the ﬁrst High-Sequence
name that she knew.
I want to know too… Klein was tempted to answer Miss Justice’s
question in such a manner.
Before he could say anything, Audrey added in a faltering tone, “I-I
can pay for the answer to this question. H-how many gold pounds do
you think is enough? I-I believe that your adorer will need a certain
amount of funds for their activities…”
Having said that, she recalled how Mr. Fool’s adorer had easily
ﬁnished Pirate Admiral Qilangos who possessed Creeping Hunger.
Clearly, he was a High-Sequence Beyonder, so she nearly said, “I
apologize. Mr. Fool, treat it as though I never said a thing.”
However, since she had already asked, she couldn’t back down! Come
on, Audrey! Perhaps The Fool has a weaker adorer? Audrey quietly bit
at her lips, silently encouraging herself.
Gold pounds? Klein thought about it seriously and said, “We’ll make
the transaction after enough information about the Secret Order is
gathered.”
As he spoke, he recalled his informant in the Psychology Alchemists,
Daxter Guderian.
Captain and I-I… Sigh… Daxter’s identity as an informant can no longer
be veriﬁed. I wonder if it’s a tragedy or a comedy… It’s a pity that I can
no longer contact him anymore. Otherwise, it would be the most
convenient way to obtain the information regarding the Spectator pathway
from him… Klein smirked.
“Alright.” Audrey answered happily.
The conversation between the two made The Hanged Man, who was
about to ask a similar question, shut his mouth. He left it until he had
gathered enough information on the Secret Order.
After a brief silence, Audrey turned her head to look at Mr. Fool and
raised her hand very slightly.
After receiving a nod of conﬁrmation, she turned to the member
opposite her and asked with a sense of anticipation, “Mr. Hanged
Man, my tip allowed you to ﬁnish Rear Admiral Hurricane. Have you
prepared the complete pituitary gland of a mature Rainbow
Salamander?”
That’s one of the reasons why I returned to the sea… Alger nodded
gently and said, “I’ve gotten the Beyonder material you wanted.
“But how should I give it to you?”
How? How should it be given to me… Audrey froze for a moment as she
lost herself in thought.
It’s impossible to just give my address… Nor can I go through Xio and
Fors. That will reveal the fact that I’m a Beyonder… Hmm, it’s not
impossible. Emperor Roselle once said that when we should choose the
lesser of two evils…
At that moment, Klein’s heart stirred. He lightly tapped the edge of
the long table and smiled.
“Miss, Sir, are you willing to cooperate with me in making an attempt
regarding this matter?”
Chapter 220: Klein's Sacriﬁcial
Trial
“Attempt?” Justice was instantly thrilled as she nodded her, acting
reserved and elegant.
“I’m very willing to cooperate.”
As a Spectator, she clearly remembered that Mr. Fool had only used
the word “attempt” on two things. The ﬁrst time involved bringing
her and The Hanged Man into this mysterious space, and the second
time was when they were given an honorary name so that they could
attempt to make a prayer. And the outcome was suﬃciently
successful, revealing “His” true nature.
What would it be this time? It really is something to look forward to!
Audrey restrained her impatience and tried her best to behave as a
qualiﬁed Spectator.
Attempt… Alger suddenly tensed up, viewing The Fool’s proposal with
utmost wariness.
What does “He” want to do? What is “His” true purpose? Is this good or
bad for me?One by one, thoughts popped up in his mind. The rapidly
rotting appearance of Rear Admiral Hurricane Qilangos surfaced in
Alger’s mind.
Finally, he lowered his head and respectfully replied, “Your wish is
my wish.”
Beside him, Derrick looked at The Hanged Man, and then at Justice,
wondering why they were so sensitive to this so-called “attempt.”
Klein lightly tapped his ﬁngers on the edge of the long bronze table
and smiled.
“This attempt will make your transaction easier and safer, and it will
deﬁnitely be suﬃciently conﬁdential.”
He turned his head to the side and looked at The Hanged Man. He
said with a moderate pace, “Do you remember the sacriﬁcial ritual
described by The Sun?”
Klein had deliberately mentioned it to show how open he was. It
made it diﬃcult for the members of the Tarot Club to imagine that
the sacriﬁcial ceremony he was about to provide had actually ﬁrst
been obtained from The Sun and that he had gone through all that
time and eﬀort back then to trick The Sun out of a template
sacriﬁcial ritual.
“I remember. I do come into contact with such things usually,” Alger
answered truthfully, but his heart was throbbing.
Since the orthodox gods rarely responded to similar rituals, the word
“sacriﬁce” had often been equated to evil gods and devils in the Fifth
Epoch!
Thinking about how this could lead to a terrifying outcome, The
Hanged Man felt as if he was walking at the edge of the abyss. If he
wasn’t careful, he would fall in, only to be eroded and devoured.
Klein followed his plans and didn’t provide further explanations. He
nodded slightly and said, “My idea is for you to sacriﬁce the
Beyonder material to me through the ritual and I’ll bestow them to
Miss Justice. A transaction like this will be beneﬁcial for both of
you.”
That can be done? Audrey was instantly dumbfounded. She felt that
this exceeded the limits of her imagination.
But she very quickly came to her senses and understood the
advantages of this method and the true nature of a deity hidden
behind this simple act!
Mr. Fool is great! As expected, our Tarot Club will be diﬀerent from the
other secret organizations! We’ll use the method of deities to exchange for
material goods and ingredients! Audrey almost said “Praise the Lady” in
her mind out of habit, but in the end, she said, “Praise Mr. Fool”
instead.
Alger turned even warier as he entered a state of calm thoughts.
“Honorable Mr. Fool, what do I need to do?”
He tried to ﬁgure out the true purpose of The Fool from the process
of the sacriﬁcial ritual.
Klein lightly pressed his right hand and said, “Like I said, this is only
an attempt. It might not succeed, so it will need your cooperation.
“First of all, prepare an altar. There’s no need to make it too
complicated; it can be very simple and crude. The only requirement
is to engrave or draw this symbol.”
As he spoke, a screen of light appeared in front of him. On it was the
symbol of the hidden “Pupil-less Eye” and the mysterious symbol of
the partial contorted lines; the same symbol on the back of The Fool’s
chair.
After previous experiments without using materials with spirituality,
Klein was certain that the sacriﬁcial ceremony he designed could
create an illusory gate above the gray fog, similar to the Door of
Summoning. However, his strength alone couldn’t construct a stable
channel, and he could only use the uniqueness of the mysterious
space above the gray fog to complete the sacriﬁce.
Therefore, he was 90% conﬁdent that the ceremony would be
successful. The only problem was if an ordinary passageway could be
constructed using ordinary materials that contained spirituality or did
it need to be Beyonder materials as well as a suﬃcient number of
them.
I’ll let Miss Justice and Mr. Hanged Man bear the cost of this
experiment… In any case, they knew from the very beginning that the
Tarot Club was a product of an attempt. It can be foreseen that there
would be other attempts subsequently and failure is inevitable. Even deities
are no exception… Klein decided to transfer the costs.
As The Hanged Man, Justice, and the Sun were attempting to
memorize the symbol, Klein chuckled.
“If you forget, you can pray to me, and then you can ‘remember.'”
“Alright,” Audrey answered happily.
With Mr. Fool, rituals aren’t tedious and troublesome! she thought
happily.
The Hanged Man nodded in response as Klein continued the
description.
“Secondly, follow the normal procedure, but there’s no need to burn
any more additional herbs or apply the holy oil. There’s no restriction
on time, just chanting my name is enough.
“Remember, use ancient Hermes or Jotun to recite this piece of
prayer.
“Your devoted servant prays for your attention,
“I pray for you to take his oﬀerings.
“I pray for you to open the gates to your Kingdom.
“After you ﬁnish chanting, combine the materials that contain
spirituality with the natural power created by the incantation, and
await my response.
“If you don’t succeed in this step, change from materials containing
spirituality to Beyonder materials, and try again from the beginning.”
After listening quietly to the procedure, Alger felt that his previous
guess was very likely to be the truth.
The Fool was in a predicament!
He oﬀered alluring attempts, making attempts one step at a time and
planned to use himself, Justice, and The Sun to slowly break free of
the restrictions. In the end, he might even descend into the real
world!
This was also the true reason why “He” had initially pulled people
into this mysterious space, agreeing to the establishment of the Tarot
Club!
Even without this previous speculation, Alger believed that he
would’ve come to the same conclusion after hearing of the
experimental procedures required after the sacriﬁcial ritual and
comparing it with The Fool’s previous attempts.
The only thing that stumped him was the possession of a powerful
adorer; therefore, there was no need for him to use himself, Justice,
and The Sun. His adorer could make similar attempts.
There must be secrets I don’t know about yet… The attempts need to be
suﬃciently secretive. And perhaps “His” adorer is being watched by
certain existences? Alger began connecting the dots.
After Klein ﬁnished describing the ritual, he asked in a low but gentle
voice, “The sacriﬁcial ritual needs a speciﬁc time. Mr. Hanged Man,
when do you plan on making the attempt?”
This was diﬀerent from responding to a request which could have a
delayed response. The stable passage created by the sacriﬁcial ritual
could only exist for a very short period of time, so Klein had to wait
above the gray fog ahead of time.
“The Rainbow Salamander’s pituitary gland is the only Beyonder
material I have with me for the time being. As for materials with
spirituality, I do have quite a lot… Mr. Fool, once the gathering ends,
I’ll immediately attempt the ﬁrst scenario. If it fails, I’ll seek out other
Beyonder materials. Once I obtain anything, I’ll inform you by
praying to conﬁrm a time,” Alger said as he couldn’t help but turn his
gaze towards Miss Justice.
As a Spectator, Audrey instantly understood what he meant. She
answered without the slightest hesitation, “If any additional
Beyonder materials are required, I’ll compensate you afterward.
Well… I can’t guarantee the speciﬁc type of material you would
want.”
As expected of the wealthy Miss Justice … The Fool—Klein—couldn’t
help but sigh before chuckling.
“We have come to an agreement.”
He looked at Justice and said after some thought, “Once Mr. Hanged
Man’s attempt succeeds, I’ll inform you of the bestowment
ceremony.”
“Alright!” Audrey was entirely conﬁdent with Mr. Fool’s abilities.
After answering the question, a sudden thought struck her as she
realized that the exchange of money could also be done through this
method. Of course, this was only if the attempt was a success.
I wonder if items without any spirituality would work or not… I’ll ask Mr.
Fool again after the attempt is successful… Audrey’s lips curled as she
thought of the beautiful future.
With the sacriﬁce and bestowment topic coming to an end, she
deliberated for a few seconds before saying, “Mr. Fool, I’ve found two
ladies suitable for our Tarot Club. They’re both Beyonders and have
their own circle and resources in Backlund. They’re also able to keep
a secret and have decent personalities. Are you willing to let them
join the gathering?”
Does Justice want to strengthen her faction within the Tarot Club? This
was the most instinctual thought that Alger had.
Derrick was very interested in this matter as he looked sideways at
Mr. Fool, waiting for his answer in anticipation.
Klein appeared to be in a bit of a dilemma. Previously, he had
imagined that the members of the Tarot Club wouldn’t know each
other, and they would then develop their own subordinates, forming
a relatively tight and secretive organization.
This way, even if a certain member was exposed, captured, or had
their spirit channeled, it wouldn’t have much of an impact on the
Tarot Club.
But Miss Justice’s description just happened to hit his weak spot. He
was hoping to ﬁnd clues regarding the Secret Order and Lanevus by
acquainting himself with Beyonders with diﬀerent circles and
resources in Backlund.
If it’s done through Justice, the person involved would eventually hold
back… However, I’m not sure if it’s possible to pull them up above the
gray fog simply by reciting my name… In order to maintain his image,
Klein didn’t think too much and instead procrastinated on it.
He said calmly, “It will require a certain amount of examination.
“Miss Justice, use a clandestine method that wouldn’t expose yourself
to let them know of my name to garner interest in them.”
When Audrey saw that her proposal was about to be accepted, she
immediately responded in excitement, “Yes, Mr. Fool!”
After a few more exchanges, the gathering came to an end. The Sun,
The Hanged Man, and Justice returned, while Klein remained in the
gray fog, waiting for the sacriﬁce.
Chapter 221: The Tarot Club at
a Higher Level
The Blue Avenger was like a leaf on the surface of the undulating
waves of the Sonia Sea. At times, it was raised high and sometimes
low from the ebbing of the waves, but there was no sign of it being at
risk of capsizing.
Alger Wilson stood in the captain cabin, his back to the shelves of red
and white wine, as he subconsciously paced around.
Finally, he gritted his teeth and returned to the mahogany desk with
a grim expression. He removed the brass sextant, found a piece of
paper and a pen, and leaned over to draw the complex, mysterious
symbol given to him by The Fool.
With a Seafarer’s memory, Alger quickly completed the ﬁrst step of
the sacriﬁcial ritual.
Then, he opened the drawer and took out a candle. He set up the
ritual according to the dualism principles and placed a candle above
the symbol that was formed by the combination of the Pupil-less Eye
and the partial contorted lines. One candle was placed in the middle
that represented the person making the sacriﬁce.
After cleaning up all the items on the table, Alger condensed pure
water in the palm of his hand and wiped the altar clean. He then
used the silver dagger from the ceremony to create a sealing wall that
surrounded his desk.
After doing all this, he used his spirituality to light up the two
candles and retreated a few steps under the dim light.
Taking a deep breath, Alger lowered his head and recited in ancient
Hermes,
“The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era,
“You are the mysterious ruler above the gray fog;
“You are the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.
“Your devoted servant prays for your attention,
“I pray for you to take his oﬀerings.
“I pray for you to open the gates to your Kingdom.”
…
This ancient incantation reverberated within the wall of spirituality,
stirring up spiraling gales as they swept forth with the force of
nature.
It was the oldest sacriﬁcial language created by human Beyonders,
and it contained many mysteries itself. However, it lacked suﬃcient
protection for the user.
Bearing with the pain that was akin to having knives slicing across
his skin, Alger took out a small dark brown glass bottle from his
pocket, unscrewed the lid, and poured out a lot of sesame-shaped
granules.
These granules swirled with a metallic luster and exuded an
indescribable sense of beauty.
Alger scattered these granules into the wind.
Whoosh!
The gale grew stronger but was no longer tempestuous. It was dyed
in two separate colors—silver and black.
As they continued to collide and mix, the two diﬀerently-colored
winds were infused into the candle ﬂame that symbolized The Fool,
burgeoning and tearing open an illusory ordinary-sized door. Its
surface was carved with the same symbol that Alger had drawn.
At this moment, Klein witnessed the appearance of the hazy door
behind his high-back chair. He could feel the spirituality in the air
that was rippling apart and stimulating the mysterious space.
It seems to be working… Klein suddenly had a premonition and
immediately spread out his spirituality, infusing it with upheavals
and stimulation.
Creak!
Amidst the insubstantial sounds, the blurry door slowly opened!
In the captain cabin, Alger suddenly saw the illusory door, formed
out of wind and light, open. Behind it was deep darkness formed
from an innumerable number of almost invisible shadows. They were
lustrous splendors encompassing massive amounts of knowledge.
Situated above them was the thick gray fog with the ancient palace
overlooking the real world.
Such a scene caused Alger to involuntarily tremble. It was a deep
fear, an indescribable excitement.
He hurriedly picked up the Rainbow Salamander’s pituitary gland
that he had long prepared. He held it with both hands, and, with his
head bowed, he raised the palm-sized object which was constantly
changing in color and had a soft feel to the ridges to the illusory
door.
Alger’s hands grew lighter under the sudden appearance and instant
disappearance of a suction force. He lost the slight tingling sensation
that the Rainbow Salamander’s pituitary gland gave him.
He didn’t dare raise his head until he heard the deep voice of The
Fool echoing in his ears.
“You did well.”
“It’s my honor,” Alger answered without any hesitation.
He looked ahead again, only to see that the illusory door had
disappeared. The gale had stopped, and the candle ﬂames had
returned to their original state.
After the candles were extinguished according to the normal
procedures, Alger sat down with a complicated expression and said to
himself silently, In the beginning, only people could be pulled into the
world above the gray fog… After a while, responses could be made by
listening to prayers… Now, sacriﬁces and bestowment can be performed…
Mr. Fool is freeing himself from his predicament one step at a time, and
bit by bit, will he enter the real world?
This guess or conclusion frightened and worried Alger, but he also
felt a bit of delight.
At least I’m a member of the Tarot Club — one of the earliest members…
He sighed.
…
In the majestic palace above the gray fog, Klein was playing with the
pituitary gland of the Rainbow Salamander. Various colors were
reﬂected on his face as they constantly changed colors.
A slight tingling sensation came from his palm, and a strong sense of
accomplishment ﬁlled his heart, causing him to reveal a genuine
smile.
In the future, the Tarot Club will become even more miraculous… After
reﬂecting over the situation, Klein extended his spirituality and sent
his will to the crimson star representing Miss Justice.
After returning to her bedroom, Audrey was no longer able to sit
quietly on the edge of the bed. She would restlessly ﬂip through the
books by her bed and from time to time, scrutinize herself in the
mirror with an unfocused gaze.
She was looking forward to the completion of The Hanged Man’s
sacriﬁcial ritual, but she was also afraid that the result would be a
failure.
Emperor Roselle had said that one must remain calm and collected when
important matters arise… Audrey, come on, take a deep breath… Or
perhaps, I should go tease the dog? However, Susie can talk and think, so
she’s an entity with her own dignity. I can’t just casually tease her…
Audrey’s mind wandered, her hand unconsciously wringing an ornate
doll dressed in splendid clothing.
After an unknown period of time, a thick gray fog suddenly appeared
before her eyes, and in the depths of the fog, there was a lofty chair.
Sitting there, The Fool said with a smile, “Miss Justice, the attempt
was successful. Have you prepared the materials that contain
spirituality?”
That’s great! As expected of Mr Fool! Audrey forgot The Hanged Man’s
role in this matter. She held back her excitement and said, “Yes, I
always have such materials with me.”
Audrey had been the same even before she joined the Tarot Club, but
back then, she didn’t know which materials could be considered to
contain spirituality. She had merely moved them from the family
treasury in accordance with the various essential oil formulas she had
gathered.
Klein nodded slightly and said, “When do you plan on holding the
ritual?
“This is based on the premise that there are no Beyonders around
you.”
Does a Beyonder dog count… Audrey looked at the tightly-shut door,
feeling a small tug at her conscience.
“I can do it now.”
Klein tersely acknowledged.
“The ritual’s process is the same as I described previously. All you
need to do is change the prayer to—
“Your devoted servant prays for your attention,
“I pray for you to open the gates to your Kingdom.
“I pray for you to give me strength.
“In addition to this, use the dualism method.”
Audrey thought it over, ﬁghting the urge to nod, and she began
preparing for the ritual.
When the illusory door opened, and a scene even more illusory than
the starry sky appeared, Audrey felt intoxicated in both body and
mind.
This is the mysterious world I’ve always been pursuing. This is the kind of
feeling I’ve always wanted! She praised Mr. Fool wholeheartedly.
It’s faith towards the Goddess, but for The Fool, it’s worship. Audrey
silently explained herself in her mind.
Soon after, she was stunned to see that there was something on the
“altar.” It was a soft object with lustrous color and was ﬁlled with
ridges.
“The Rainbow Salamander’s pituitary gland!” Audrey felt a surge of
joy in her heart. Her eyes lit up as she had the urge to step forward
and grab it.
However, her customs of etiquette took hold of her as she sincerely
praised Mr. Fool once again.
After ﬁnishing the ritual, she impatiently walked forward and
carefully examined the Beyonder material ﬁve times.
Our Tarot Club is at a higher level than all the other secret
organizations… Audrey secretly felt smug.
She then glanced warily at the door, as if afraid of Susie’s sudden
intrusion.
She had to redouble her eﬀorts and immediately concoct the potion
to complete her advancement!
A few minutes later, she held a bottle of liquid that contained
constantly changing lusters that could shine to the bottom of
everyone’s hearts.
She conﬁdently drank the Telepathist potion and successfully tide
through the integration stage with the Beyonder characteristics,
achieving an advancement.
The view before her seemed to clear up signiﬁcantly, with a great
increase in other aspects. Audrey familiarly used Cogitation to
restrain the dissipating spirituality.
After her Sequence stabilized, she smiled and walked briskly to the
door, letting in the golden retriever. She saw the obvious suspicion
on Susie’s face.
“You took far longer than usual.” Susie didn’t hide her thoughts.
Audrey sat down on an ottoman and dryly laughed before changing
the subject.
“Susie, tell me—how should I secretly inform Xio and Fors about a
particular matter without revealing myself; yet get them interested?”
Before she ﬁnished her sentence, Audrey had begun to seriously
ponder over the mission Mr. Fool had assigned her.
Then, she looked at Susie, and Susie looked back at her. The human
and dog both fell into deep thought at the same moment.
…
After completing his goal, Klein returned to reality, slept for a little
more than an hour before hurrying out the door. He spent a pound to
buy a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, wigs, and a variety of mustaches
that could be torn oﬀ and stuck on with adhesives. They were
disguises he would need later.
Before dinner, he made a trip to East Borough, the most crowded
area and the most unsafe part of the city. He rented a one-bedroom
house at the rent of four soli, three pence a week. He paid two weeks
rent and a deposit, coming up to a total of 17 solis.
Only then did Klein complete all his early preparations. East Borough
also left a deep impression on him. Most of the streets here were the
same as Tingen’s Lower Street, but the area that shared the traits was
many times larger.
The clothes of the residents here were old but decent. Many of them
were dressed in shabby clothes with sallow skin and thin frames. It
was as though they would turn into beasts at any moment due to
their hunger or poverty. Therefore, gangs ran rampant in East
Borough.
When he got back to Cherwood Borough, Klein felt as if he had
entered heaven from hell.
For the next two days, he experimented with using his spirituality to
perform the rituals and create charms. He no longer prayed to the
Goddess and waited for the eﬀects of his tiny advertisements to bear
fruit.
On Thursday morning, Klein ﬁnally heard the doorbell ring.
Chapter 222: The First Job
Ding! Dong! A rope was being tugged, causing the doorbell and the
sound it made to constantly tinkle and send its sound echoing
throughout the spacious but relatively empty living room.
Klein, who was seated on the sofa reading a newspaper to study the
various investment opportunities, stood up. He was wearing a white
shirt and a black vest without a bow tie, just like what one would
wear at home.
The ﬁrst job in my career as a detective? But I can’t always be at home,
waiting for a mission to arrive. Yes… I need to hang a notice on the door,
along with a fountain pen, so that clients can write down the time of their
next visit and allow me to prepare in advance… However, for a new
detective in this profession, without any fame, doing so would basically be
the same as not having a “next time”… Sigh, I can only go through the
trouble of performing a divination in the morning to see if I would receive
any jobs for the day. And if so, what time so as to make plans… Of
course, it’s also possible that I would miss out on missions from powerful
Beyonders. Well, so be it, it might be a good thing after all…
He walked to the door, and without looking through the peephole,
the image of the visitors outside appeared in his mind:
One of them was an old lady in a black plush hat. Her back was
slightly hunched, and her face was deeply wrinkled. Her skin was
shriveled and sallow, but her dark dress was very formal and neat.
Her temples were completely white, but her blue eyes were quite
lively. She was looking at the young man beside her, gesturing for
him to pull the doorbell again.
The young man was in his twenties, with eyes similar to those of the
old lady’s. In the progressively cold weather, he wore a black double-
breasted coat, a half top hat, and a bow tie like he was about to
attend a banquet, it was as if he wouldn’t relax his demands of
himself at any moment.
With the help of a Clown’s premonition, Klein turned the handle,
opened the door, and greeted his visitors with a smile before the bell
could ring again.
“Good morning, Madam, Sir. What a wonderful day it is, at least up
to this point for I have already seen the sun for ﬁve minutes.”
He spoke of the weather in a slightly exaggerated manner, small talk
that had been popular in Backlund for more than a century.
“Yes, it’s always shy and doesn’t come out from behind the fog and
the dark clouds.” The old lady nodded in agreement.
By her side, the lad asked, “Are you Detective Sherlock Moriarty?”
“Yes, and what may I help you with? I’m sorry, please come in. Let’s
sit down and talk.” Klein turned his body to the side, making way for
his guests as he pointed to the guest area.
“No, there’s no need. I don’t want to waste any time. My poor Brody
is still waiting for me to save it!” the old lady said with a rather sharp
voice.
“It?” Klein noticed the most important pronoun and suddenly had a
bad feeling.
The very formally dressed young man nodded and said, “Brody is a
cat owned by my grandmother, Madam Doris. He went missing last
night, and I hope you can help us ﬁnd him. We live at the end of this
street, and I’m willing to pay you 5 soli for it. Of course, if you can
prove that you’ve spent more time and eﬀort than that, I’ll make it up
to you.”
Find a cat? The reason why you’re entrusting me with this job is simply
because of the convenience stemming from how we live on the same
street… Klein felt that this wasn’t the detective career that he had
imagined.
It makes me look like a clown… Well, I can’t turn down my ﬁrst business
deal. This is a seer’s point of view… He pondered for a few seconds and
asked, “Can you describe it in detail?”
Granny Doris spoke out before the young man could open his mouth.
“Brody is a lovely, lively black cat. It’s very healthy, has beautiful
green eyes, and loves to eat cooked chicken breast. Goddess, last
night, he ran oﬀ just like that. No, it must’ve gotten lost. I’ve placed
lots of chicken breast in its bowl, but it refuses to return to take a
look.
… Klein’s lips curved up and said, “I’m very satisﬁed with your
description, Mrs. Doris.”
“I accept this request. Alright, let’s go to your home now. I need to
search for clues and ﬁnd traces. You should be clear that the basis of
my reasoning lies in the details.” Mrs. Doris didn’t consult her
grandson as she nodded and said, “You’re the most proactive
detective I’ve ever seen. It’s a deal!”
Klein put on his coat and hat, picked up his cane, and followed
Madam Doris and her grandson out onto the street.
Unlike Tingen, roads in many parts of Backlund had been rebuilt with
cement or asphalt. Even during a downpour, the roads were less
muddy.
While the old lady was leading the way, his grandson came close to
Klein and said in a low voice, “I hope you’ll do your best to ﬁnd
Brody. It’s been one of the pillars of my grandmother’s life ever since
my grandfather and parents passed away.”
“After Brody went missing, something went wrong with my
grandmother’s mind, so much so that she’s started hearing things. She
keeps telling me that she hears poor Brody mewing miserably.”
Klein immediately nodded and said, “I’ll do my best. Right, I still
haven’t gotten your name.”
“Jurgen, Jurgen Cooper, a senior solicitor,” the young man replied.
Soon, they reached 58 Minsk Street and entered the dark house.
“This is Brody’s bowl. This is his favorite box. He always sleeps here.”
Doris’s wrinkled face was ﬁlled with worry and expectation.
Klein squatted down and found several strands of black cat fur in the
box.
He straightened up and gripped his silver-inlaid cane with the hand
that held the cat’s fur.
Klein’s gaze turned deep as he pretended to observe his surroundings
as he silently recited a divination sentence.
His hand secretly slipped from the end of the cane but didn’t leave it
completely. It just made it diﬃcult for Jurgen or Doris to notice that
the cane was standing on its own.
Soon after, the black silver-inlaid cane tilted to the side. It fell very
slowly, with very little movement.
Klein gripped the cane again, looked in that direction, and observed
it for more than ten seconds.
Then, he strode over to an old cupboard.
“Any signs of Brody running away?” Jurgen asked with concern. The
old lady, Doris, was also waiting for an answer.
Without answering, Klein kneeled and pulled open the door at the
bottom of the cupboard.
Meow!
A black cat darted out, tail high, and ran for its bowl.
“Brody… When did you get into the cupboard? How did you get
locked in there?” Mrs. Doris cried, surprised and confused.
Jurgen turned his head in surprise and looked at Klein.
“How did you know it was in the cupboard?”
Klein smiled, and replied in a deep voice, “Inference, my good man.”
…
After obtaining the 5 soli reward from Mrs. Doris and Jurgen, as well
as their friendship, Klein returned to 15 Minsk Street under the
gloomy weather.
Before he even got close, he saw a ﬁgure loitering in front of his
door.
More business? When Klein looked over, he saw that the visitor was a
boy of ﬁfteen or sixteen, dressed in an old coat and a round hat that
didn’t ﬁt his age.
It’s him? Klein immediately recognized him as the boy he had met on
the steam train the day he had arrived in Backlund. Back then, he
was being pursued, but his maturity and calmness at the time had left
quite a deep impression on Klein.
What would he want to entrust me with… As he wondered, Klein
walked over and smiled.
“Excuse me, are you looking for me?”
The teenage boy was startled as he quickly turned around, his bright
red eyes ﬁlled with unconcealable fear.
He composed himself and asked hesitantly, “Are you Detective
Sherlock Moriarty?”
“Yes.” Klein looked around and said, “Let’s talk inside.”
“Alright.” The teenage boy didn’t refuse.
Inside, Klein didn’t take oﬀ his coat, but he did take oﬀ his hat and
put his cane away.
He led the teenage boy to the guest area, pointed at the long sofa and
said, “Please, have a seat. How might I address you? What job do you
have for me?”
“You can call me Ian,” the teenage boy surveyed his surroundings
and fell silent for a few seconds. “I was previously hired by another
detective, Mr. Zreal Viktor Lee, who helped me gather some news
and information.”
Klein sat down, clasped his hands, and said, “Does the job have
anything to do with your former employer?”
“Yes,” Ian nodded solemnly. “A few days ago I suddenly found myself
being followed, by someone with ill intentions; therefore, I thought of
a way to lose their tail… Uh… I believe you saw this scene yourself,
Mr. Moriarty. I recognized you as the man who was sizing me up on
the metro that day as soon as I saw you.”
… This level of observational skills isn’t any worse than a Spectator’s…
Could it be that he was born with a special ability? Or is he a Beyonder?
Klein activated his Spirit Vision and looked at Ian, but he didn’t ﬁnd
anything strange.
He nodded and calmly replied, “Your response left an impression on
me.”
Ian didn’t harp on the topic and continued, “I suspect that my
encounter has something to do with Mr. Zreal, so I went to visit him
at his place. I found the place seemingly normal, but there were
many hints that indicated that someone had inﬁltrated and triggered
all the tiny mechanisms.
“I haven’t seen Mr. Zreal since that day. I suspect that something has
happened to him.
“I tried to call the police, but his disappearance period has yet to
reach the required number of days to make the request. I tried to get
help from other detectives that I knew, but all of them turned me
down, on the grounds that they had just met Mr. Zreal at a fellow
detective’s party.
“That surprised me because I didn’t receive any response from Mr.
Zreal when I contacted him using the agreed upon method.
“I still stood by my judgment and intended to ask for the help of a
detective whom Mr. Zreal doesn’t know. Well, as such, that meant it
would be someone I don’t know either. I had no idea who to look for
as well. Therefore, I could only search through the newspapers and
ended up ﬁnding you, Mr. Sherlock Moriarty.”
Chapter 223: Three Matters
Klein asked after listening carefully, “So you suspect that the Zreal
whom the detectives saw was someone in disguise?”
Holding his brown round hat, Ian replied as if he had already thought
about it, “It’s a possibility, but I think it’s too diﬃcult due to the huge
risks involved. The party was at night, and it’s true that the lights
weren’t very bright — but most of the people attending are
detectives, detectives with keen observational skills. Just a wig,
beard, or cosmetics can hardly hide from their eyes.”
Perhaps some Beyonder powers can do it… Just like how Creeping Hunger
enables such an ability… There was a little trap in Klein’s question. He
wished to determine from the teenage boy’s answer, the expression
on his face, and his body language to determine if he had ever come
into contact with Beyonders, or if he knew things about mysticism.
The initial answer was no.
When Ian saw Detective Moriarty nodding slightly in agreement with
his reasoning, he continued, “I believe that the detectives saw Mr.
Zreal, but he wasn’t free. He was in a controlled state in which he
couldn’t send out distress signals. The reason why he wasn’t
responding to my attempts to liaison with him is to probably signal to
me that he needs help.”
“A reasonable explanation.” Klein released his clasped hands and sat
back a little, making himself look more relaxed and conﬁdent.
Ian fell silent for about ten seconds before he said seriously, “I’d like
to entrust you with the task of investigating Mr. Zreal and determine
his current condition. All I need is conﬁrmation.”
Considering that Ian was a semi-professional who had gathered
intelligence and information for a detective, Klein had the intention
to make his acquaintance. He smiled and said, “Then how much are
you going to pay? You should be well aware that this may be very
dangerous.”
Ian looked down at the pocket of his old coat and said after some
deliberation, “There are two ways. The ﬁrst, I can directly give you a
payment that’s enough to satisfy you. Afterward, regardless of
whether the mission is simple or diﬃcult, that will be all unless you
suﬀer a relatively serious injury.
“Secondly, I could pay you ﬁve pounds in advance, and when you
ﬁnish the job, you can add on to the bill depending on the diﬃculty
of the matter. But it’s easy to cause a dispute, even if there’s a
contract.”
Klein pretended to be in thought and after almost thirty seconds, he
said in a low voice, “Why don’t we do it this way? You can pay me
ﬁve pounds in advance and help me with three things after the
mission is completed. Don’t worry, they won’t be anything diﬃcult.
They will be within your capabilities, and it won’t make you feel too
uncomfortable. This can be agreed upon in the contract.”
Ian knitted his brows before standing up. He leaned forward and
stretched out his right hand.
“Alright!”
Klein shook hands with him, pulled out a standard contract that he
had prepared, picked up a round fountain pen, added all the details
he had discussed, and stamped it with his ﬁngerprint.
After signing the contract, he gave the teenage boy, Ian, a stack of
white paper and watched him write Detective Zreal’s relevant
information.
After a while, he browsed through the information and casually
asked, “How can I contact you if there’s an emergency, or if I’ve
conﬁrmed Zreal’s condition?”
Ian pursed his lips and remained silent for quite a while. Only when
Klein looked over did he reply in a somewhat stiﬀ manner, “You
don’t need to contact me. I will appear at the right time.”
Without another word, he took out a thick stack of cash from the
pocket of his old coat. They seemed to be stacked up in a very neat
order, from high face value to low face value.
Ian pulled out three one-pound notes from the bottom, counted six
ﬁve-soli notes, and ﬁnally ten one-soli notes.
When Klein saw that Ian had neatly arranged the notes, with even the
portraits of the former kings facing up without a single mistake, Klein
suddenly felt a bit frustrated.
This is some late-stage obsessive-compulsive disorder… He silently
exhaled and received the payment from Ian.
According to his visual estimate, Ian had less than three pounds left.
He probably had all his savings with him… If I had asked for more, would
he bail on me without paying? He doesn’t look like the kind of person to
do so, but one shouldn’t judge a book by its cover… Klein folded the
bills at random and stuﬀed them into his pocket, ignoring the
untidiness. As such, he succeeded in seeing Ian’s slightly twisted
expression.
“I’ll try to complete the investigation as soon as possible.” Klein stood
up and held out his hand as a gesture of bidding him farewell.
“Thank you for your help.” Ian thanked him sincerely because the
counteroﬀer was obviously a “discount.”
Watching the boy who was more mature than his age leave, Klein
stroked his chin and silently said to himself, This matter goes deeper
than it seems.
Ian didn’t mention anything about Zreal’s recent investigations or what
information he had been instructed to gather…
Forget it. I’ll handle as much as the money is worth. All I need to do is
conﬁrm Zreal’s current condition.
He turned around and walked back into the living room. While doing
so, he ﬁshed a quarter pence out of his trouser pocket.
Ping!
As the copper coin tumbled in the air, Klein’s eyes turned dark as he
muttered if there were any Beyonder elements in the case he was
handling.
Then, he opened his right hand and tried to catch the copper penny.
Clang! The coin slipped from his ﬁngertips and fell to the ground,
rolling away.
This result meant that the divination had failed.
From the looks of it, Ian has withheld more things than I thought… The
information is so lacking that I can’t even obtain a vague divination
result… He pursed his lips, took a few steps forward, and bent down
to pick up the coin.
…
That night, in the wee hours of the morning, at 138 Rose Street,
Backlund Bridge.
Klein had changed into a cheap light-blue workman’s outﬁt. His
mouth, chin, and cheeks were covered with a black beard that, at
ﬁrst glance, made him look rough and savage.
He wore a dark-colored cap and pressed it so low that it nearly
covered his eyes.
Such caps originated from the Intis Republic hunters. There were
certain diﬀerences from the traditional deer-hunting caps the Loen
Kingdom hunters wore. However, such caps had become popular
among the lower-class populace of Backlund.
Hiding in the shadows of an Intis parasol tree by the side of the road,
Klein studied the house across the street with the aid of the elegant
gas lamps.
It was Zreal’s home.
The detective was from Southville. His parents, relatives, and friends
were all there, and he had come to Backlund alone where he slowly
forged a name for himself.
He was still a bachelor and had only hired two temporary maids, the
kind that came by every three days to clean up the place, without
needing to provide them with food or lodging.
At the moment, the terrace house he rented was pitch dark.
Klein took oﬀ the silver chain inside his sleeve and let the topaz
pendant hang down naturally.
“There’s danger inside.
“There’s danger inside.”
…
After repeating it seven times, he opened his eyes and saw the spirit
pendulum spinning clockwise, but very slowly.
“There’s danger, but it’s nothing serious,” Klein muttered, and once
again conﬁrmed that he had his tarot cards, self-made charms, and
Holy Night Powder on him.
After doing all this, he looked around, and taking advantage of the
stillness of the night, he nimbly rushed across the street.
There was no veranda, garden, or lawn as it directly faced the edge of
the street. Klein went around to the side and easily climbed up the
water pipe to the small balcony on the second ﬂoor where clothes
could be hung out to dry.
Immediately following that, he took out a tarot card and slid it
through the crack, opening the door to the corridor.
Following Ian’s drawing of the house’s layout, Klein walked almost
soundlessly to Zreal’s bedroom.
He lightly tapped his left molar and activated his Spirit Vision.
Through the wooden door, he looked inside.
Spirit Vision could see aura colors through obstacles without
spirituality. However, it was highly dependent on one’s abilities.
Currently, Klein was able to observe through wooden doors but was
stumped by concrete walls. Furthermore, the scenes he could see
weren’t too clear.
In his vision, he saw three humanoid auras in the bedroom behind
the door. The colors were blurry and were located in diﬀerent
locations.
There are three people lying in ambush… Is it to capture Ian, or someone
else? The bedroom isn’t that big… Klein stood in the darkness, calmly
considering the results of his observations.
At that moment, he suddenly retreated towards the balcony while
keeping his footsteps very light.
Back at the balcony, Klein took a thin silver slice from his pocket.
This was a Slumber Charm that he had created in an attempt during
the afternoon.
He didn’t pray to the Evernight Goddess, but to himself instead. He
held a ritual in the name of “The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era,
the mysterious ruler above the gray fog; the King of Yellow and Black
who wields good luck” before entering the world above the gray fog
to respond.
Since this method was diﬃcult to mobilize the power of the
mysterious space above the gray fog, Klein could only use his own
spirituality to “respond.” The charms that he made in the end were
worse than normal, but better than the ones he made in his own
name.
After surveying his surroundings again, Klein covered his mouth and
whispered a word in ancient Hermes.
“Crimson.”
Feeling the chill of the charm, he moved quickly but silently to the
door of Zreal’s bedroom again. As he held the handle, he injected
spirituality into the thin silver slice.
Creak! Klein carefully twisted the handle and opened a tiny crack in
the door.
Immediately after that, he threw the Slumber Charm inside.
Pulling back his arm, Klein closed the door again and began
counting.

He abruptly pushed open the door and rolled on the ground.
Not sensing any movement from the three people, Klein stood up
and, using the crimson moonlight shining through the window, began
observing the room.
It was a normal furnished bedroom with a bed, a row of closets, a
desk, a set of sofas, and a coat rack.
On the other side of the bed, a man in a black coat was sleeping
soundly.
In addition to that, there was one person by the side of the sofa and
another in front of the closet. All of them were asleep.
After conﬁrming the trio’s condition, Klein walked over to the bed
and bent down to ﬁnd a few short, yellowish-brown hair.
According to what Ian had written, Detective Zrell was a man with
short, yellowish-brown hair.
“This should be right…” Klein whispered. He grabbed the few strands
of hair and sat down on the sofa. He slowly sat in the darkness
tainted by the crimson light and planned on using dream divination
to ﬁnd Zreal.
Leaning back against the back of the sofa, the corner of his mouth
curled up as he made a self-deprecating comment, Deduction, my good
man…
Chapter 224: Metaphysics-styled
Detective
Chapter 224: Metaphysics-styled Detective
The dim room was covered in a thin veil of crimson moonlight, and
everything was indistinct.
The three men in the black coats were sleeping in diﬀerent spots. And
on the sofa, Klein’s eyes half-blended into the darkness by closing
them, it was as if he had entered a deep slumber.
His dream was a gray, distorted world, occasionally ﬂashing with
brilliance.
Finally, the brilliance settled to form a scene.
It was a gloomy corner, the ground sloshed with sewage. A man with
short brown hair, a white shirt, and a brown vest was leaning against
the wall, surrounded by a dense mischief of gray rats.
Half of the man’s lips had been bitten oﬀ, revealing his yellowish
teeth and rotten gums. His nose was only stained with blood, mixed
with some short hairs, and the ﬂesh on his face had disappeared,
piece by piece, revealing white bone. White, fat maggots were
crawling around everywhere, constantly squirming, and his throat
seemed to have been the victim of some wild beast; at least half of it
was missing.
Klein could just barely make out that this was Zreal Viktor Lee. It was
nearly impossible to relate him to the mature and handsome man in
the black-and-white photograph he had taken with Ian.
Zreal is already dead. In a few days, he would probably be gnawed to
the point where he would only be bone. He might not even have a
complete skeleton left…Klein left the dream and recalled what he
had just seen.
His past experiences had allowed him to witness similar corpses more
calmly.
Looking out of the window at the crimson moon, Klein thought for
more than ten seconds and decided to try communicating with the
soul of the man in black next to the sofa.
During the last few days of preparations, he had concocted a bottle of
Amantha extract and Eye of the Spirit medication. As for Serenity
Agent, Klein had no need for it. He was personally capable of
invading the dreams of others and forcefully communicating with
their souls while maintaining calm and rationale.
After setting up a simple altar and letting the quiet and tranquil
fragrance waft out to create a half-dreaming state, Klein prayed to
himself, “The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era.”
Following that, he entered the world above the gray fog and used
more than two-thirds of his spirituality to give a response.
When I advance to Sequence 7, such prayers should also allow me to
use a little of the power of the mysterious space above the gray fog,
just like my summoning and bestowment rituals… Looking around,
Klein made a rough judgment and quickly returned to the real world.
He passed through what seemed like a starry sky and a chaotic storm
of thoughts, entering the mental plane of the target. There, he saw
the man’s illusory ﬁgure ﬂoating in midair.
“Who sent you to Zreal’s home?” Klein looked at him and asked in a
deep voice.
The man replied in a daze, his illusory eyes vacant, “Meursault.
Meursault sent me to wait for the boy named Ian.”
The light in his spiritual world changed, revealing a lean, capable-
looking, dark-skinned man. He was none other than the leader of the
group who was chasing Ian on the steam train.
As expected, it’s him… Klein, who had exhausted so much of his
spirituality in responding to the prayer, was beginning to feel
exhausted. He hurriedly asked, “Who ordered Meursault?”
“No idea… He’s an ‘executioner’ of our Zmanger gang. No one can
order him other than the boss,” the man said, blankly.
Zmanger… The word “warrior” in the language of the highlanders…
Klein, a pseudo-historian but a true mysticism scholar, suddenly felt a
sharp pain in his head, and his body involuntarily ﬂew out of the
storm of thoughts.
Not long afterwards, he exited the mediumship and felt his head
throbbing.
He was in no hurry to leave. He methodically packed up the
materials and the short yellowish-brown hair before opening the oriel
window to let in the cold night wind to disperse the smell of the
Amantha extract and Eye of the Spirit medication.
While this happened, Klein returned to the balcony, locked the door
from the inside, and wiped oﬀ all the places he had touched.
When Zreal’s bedroom returned to its original state, he then held his
hand to his chest and bowed towards the three men who were still
sleeping soundly.
Straightening his back, Klein put on his gloves and leaped, nimbly
ﬂipping out of the oriel window. He stood ﬁrmly, tiptoeing in the
abnormally tight space.
He raised the open window’s vertical latch and used a tarot card to
hold its bottom. With his Clown abilities, he took in the details and
adjusted the balance.
After a few seconds, Klein slowly pulled back the tarot card, and the
vertical latch suddenly stopped in place and didn’t fall further.
Whoosh!
First, he closed the unlatched half of the window, then he jumped
over to the window with a latch. His right hand jerked inward,
closing the other half of the window.
The speed of the action was so quick that the latch didn’t fall down
until there was a vibration, accurately inserting itself into the
matching hole.
Clang! A sound that was diﬃcult to eliminate rang out, like a strong
wind slamming onto the surface of the glass.
Klein knew that the three men in the bedroom were about to awaken.
Without further ado, he jumped onto the street.
For the current him, the height from the second ﬂoor wouldn’t pose
any danger. It was just that he couldn’t maintain his silence when he
landed, so he didn’t make any obvious noises.
Klein quickly left the vicinity, as well as Rose Street, but he didn’t
directly take a rental carriage back to Cherwood Borough’s Minsk
Street.
He turned a few corners and headed to the neighboring East Borough.
It was a cold night, and the wind sent a biting chill right into his
bones. Klein shivered and decided that he would need an additional
sweater for his future missions. He decided to buy charcoal on one of
the following days and let the ﬁreplace carry out its role.
After an unknown period of time, he entered Backlund’s East
Borough despite not having a map. He had completely relied on
instinct.
There were only a few gas lamps to be seen in the distance, and if it
wasn’t for the fact that the dark clouds hadn’t covered the crimson
moon, Klein believed that many parts of the road would be pitch
black.
As he was walking, he suddenly saw pairs of eyes appear in the deep
darkness in front of him. They came stooping from a distance.
They sauntered over from a vague distance away, in silence.
Living corpses? Klein came to a sudden halt. He reached out for his
Requiem Charm and tarot cards, and he quickly activated his Spirit
Vision.
He saw the unhealthy and weak colored auras and saw the faces of
the numerous ﬁgures.
These were all living people, normal living people with numbed
expressions, vacant eyes, and weak movements. There were both men
and women.
It’s almost midnight; why are they still walking on the streets…
Confused, Klein warily leaned to one side, passing the group on the
sidewalk, but soon, he came across a second wave, a third wave; all
of them had the same pain amidst numbness.
He frowned slightly, and just as he was about to move forward to
inquire, he suddenly heard a shout ahead.
“Get up! All of you get up!
“You sons of bitches!
“The streets and parks aren’t for people like you to sleep in!”
… Klein was startled, then the corresponding term “Poor Law”
popped up in his mind, and he understood what was going on.
He had experienced the same thing himself.
Phew… Klein exhaled, picked up the pace, and headed for his one-
bedroom house on Black Palm Street in the East Borough.
There, he slept for two hours. After recovering some of his
spirituality, he went out again and broke a withered branch to serve
as a “dowsing rod.”
“The location of Zreal’s corpse.
“The location of Zreal’s corpse.”
…
After repeated divinations, Klein walked for a long time with the help
of the short yellowish-brown hair until he arrived at a corner of East
Borough where there was a sewer entrance.
Twelve years ago, after the great plague, the Loen Kingdom gradually
built up an advanced sewer system in the capital and, in one fell
swoop, surpassed “Roselle’s Heritage” of the Intis Republic.
Moving the manhole cover out the way, Klein held his breath and
climbed down the vertical metal stairs.
Since his clothes weren’t specially made, he was unable to bring too
many items due of the lack of pockets. He hadn’t brought Quelaag’s
Oil which he had learned about from Frye. Klein felt especially
regretful for not having brought the refreshing and odor-dispelling
Quelaag’s Oil.
Ten seconds later, Klein’s feet touched the sticky ground.
The feeling of ﬁlth caused ﬁne goosebumps to pop up over his arms
and body. However, he could only endure it and continue walking
forward, venturing deeper into the empty and quiet sewer.
There was a fork in the road ahead, one which was relatively hidden.
A thick pungent smell wafted over from there.
Klein turned around and walked to the end where he saw a dense
number of spirituality light dots and aura colors.
Without needing to use a candle, he activated his Spirit Vision and
directly saw that in the dark corner, there was a rotten corpse that
had been bitten to pieces.
This was the exact same scene he had seen in the dream divination.
Squeak!
The densely packed gray rats scampered in every direction, but there
were also some who stayed where they were, unwilling to leave and
part with their food.
After conﬁrming that it was Zreal, Klein hesitated for a moment
before quickly setting up a mediumship ritual.
Hmm… If there’s nothing wrong with Ian’s description, and Zreal
died only a few days ago, I should be able to get some rough
information by channeling his spirit…he thought conﬁdently.
Whoosh!
As the wind swirled and the wall of spirituality was set up, all the
rats ﬂed, and Klein proceeded with his ritual as he had done before.
“The cause of Zreal’s death.
“The cause of Zreal’s death.”
…
As he recited the words, Klein’s eyes turned black. His pupils and the
whites of his eyes disappeared. He quickly used Cogitation to enter a
dream.
However, nothing appeared in that misty, illusory world.
Klein opened his eyes, frowning slightly as he made his judgment.
The channeling failed…
Someone has dealt with Zreal’s spirit…
A Beyonder was involved in this.
The fact that someone was able to disguise as Zreal, making the other
detectives unable to see through him, also proves this point.
After some deliberation, Klein came to a decision; it was to end this
matter here and not get involved any further. Regardless, he had
fulﬁlled the requirements of the job that he was entrusted with.
“I’ll get Ian to call the police,” he muttered as he put away the
materials and removed the wall of spirituality.
Chapter 225: Unnoticeable
Guidance
Klein backed up from the fork in the path, without touching Zreal’s
corpse.
Thump! Thump! Thump!
Suddenly, a sound echoed in the distance through the empty sewers.
Klein listened for a few seconds before decisively retreating towards
the exit, down the dirty concrete road that ran along both sides of the
sewage channel.
There was no need to take risks in matters that didn’t involve him.
Klein closed the iron manhole cover after he climbed out of the
sewers. After ensuring that the surrounding area looked normal, he
returned to his rented room in the East Borough and changed out of
his disguise.
Then, he put on his gold-rimmed glasses, walked to another street,
took a rented carriage, and returned to Cherwood Borough in the
silence and cold of three in the morning. However, he didn’t return to
Minsk Street.
Then, Klein made another huge detour, and only after conﬁrming
that no one was following him, did he enter his house. He slept till
dawn and was woken up by the doorbell.
He sat up immediately, put on his shirt, buttoned his vest, and
hurried down to the ﬁrst ﬂoor to open the door.
And even before that, his premonition ability as a Clown was already
capable of naturally forming the image of the visitor in his mind.
The visitor was wearing an old coat, a brown round hat, and a
tattered satchel. He had bright red eyes, a delicate face, and a quiet
temperament. It was none other than Ian, the teenage boy who had
come to entrust him with a job yesterday.
“Good morning, Detective Moriarty,” Ian greeted him and looked
around. “Any progress? Yeah… I’m only asking because I happened
to pass by.”
Klein nodded seriously and said, “Yes.”
“…” Ian seemed shocked as he didn’t say a word for quite a while.
After a while, he stammered in surprise, “Have you determined Mr.
Zreal’s condition?”
“Yes.” Klein paused for a moment, then said seriously, “I found
Zreal’s corpse.”
“Corpse…” Ian’s pupils shrank as he repeated it in a low tone.
He wasn’t too surprised, as if he had already expected the worst
possible outcome.
Klein watched silently without interjecting.
“Sigh…” Ian exhaled and warily surveyed his surroundings. “Your
eﬃciency is amazing. Can you take me to see Mr. Zreal’s body?”
“No problem. In fact, that’s what I was planning to do.” Klein then
thought for a moment before saying, “I hope you won’t mention me
when you call the police. Just say that you found the corpse yourself.
I believe you know how to make up a reason.”
Ian wasn’t surprised; he knew that not every detective liked to deal
with the police. In fact, except for the very famous detectives, who
often gave advice to the police with mutual cooperation, the rest
were discriminated against, ostracized, and even extorted from.
This was the current situation of the Loen Kingdom.
“Alright,” Ian readily agreed.
Considering that they were entering the sewers, Klein changed into a
set of clothes worn by the common working class, put on a deer-
hunting cap, and took a lantern with him.
Both of them took the public carriage to the East Borough. They
walked for half an hour to reach the remote sewer entrance under the
watchful gazes ﬁlled with numbness and malicious intent.
“How did you ﬁnd it?” Ian asked, half-surprised and half-curious, as
he watched Klein lift the manhole cover and climb down.
Klein focused on the area beneath him and answered casually,
“Skillful training which includes many techniques in reasoning,
investigation, tracking, and interrogation.”
Ian followed him into the sewers. He nodded without looking
disgusted.
“… You seem to have received very professional training.”
Klein didn’t answer him directly. He held the already lit lantern and
led Ian to the fork in the path where they arrived at the gloomy
corner.
He narrowed his eyes as he approached. More of Zreal’s body was
missing now when compared to the previous night. He was missing
an arm and half of his ribs.
That’s not something a rat can do… Klein muttered to himself and
didn’t inform Ian of this.
With the help of the lantern’s light, Ian was able to clearly see the
corpse’s appearance.
He squatted down suddenly, vomited, and gradually vomited yellow-
green bile. Klein took out the Quelaag’s Oil he prepared, unscrewed
the cap, and bent over to place the mouth close to Ian’s nose.
Ian’s eyes lit up, and he calmed down.
Nearly twenty seconds later, he weakly whispered, “Thank you…”
He stood up slowly and examined the mutilated corpse a few more
times.
“I can conﬁrm that this is Detective Zrell.”
“My condolences,” Klein replied out of politeness. “I suggest you call
the police.”
“Okay.” Ian nodded indiscernibly as he followed Klein back to the
surface.
At that moment, Klein clapped his hands.
“This is the end of my mission. As for what should be done after this,
that is up to you.”
Ian fell silent for a few seconds.
“I still owe you three matters. You can tell me now.”
“Actually, I can only think of one at the moment,” Klein answered
frankly. “I want to know where I can get a gun and bullets, without
needing a full class weapon permit.”
Ian spoke, almost without thinking, “Go to Bravehearts Bar at Iron
Gate Street in the Backlund Bridge district. Find Kaspars Kalinin. Tell
him ‘Old Geezer’ introduced you.”
“Alright, let’s talk about the other two matters in the future. I have a
feeling that we’ll meet again.” Klein deliberately nodded casually.
Ian gave him a look but didn’t say anything.
The two split up and headed down diﬀerent streets in the East
Borough. The secluded spot, once again, regained its silence.
After walking for a while, Klein suddenly turned around and retraced
his steps. He then hid himself in a secluded corner, peeking at the
entrance to the sewer.
After waiting for two or three minutes, he saw Ian return silently as
he looked around warily.
Klein withdrew his gaze in a timely manner, leaned his back against
the wall, and listened.
He heard the scraping sound of the manhole cover being removed
and heard someone climbing down.
Carefully poking his head out, Klein discovered that Ian had re-
entered the sewers.
Was there a clue or something on Zreal’s body? Indeed, this matter goes
deeper than it seems… He nodded thoughtfully.
Having satisﬁed his curiosity, Klein decided to leave for real and
planned to seek out Kaspars, two days later.
…
At tea time, Viscount Glaint was in his home situated in Empress
Borough.
The door to the study was tightly shut, separating the four people
inside from the participating guests in the salon outside.
“Xio, Fors, this is the reward the two of you deserve.” Dressed in a
pale yellow lace dress, Audrey pushed a bulging envelope across the
desk to the two ladies sitting opposite her.
Xio wanted to say something polite, but her hand had reached for the
envelope faster than her mouth. Feeling the weight of the money, she
could only say sincerely, “Miss Audrey, thank you for your
generosity. Your honesty makes you look even more beautiful.”
As she spoke, she untied the thin string around the envelope and saw
the bills inside.
It was uniform gray paper money with black stripes. The stack was
thick and exuded a special smell of ink, one that left one feeling
refreshed.
“10 pounds…” Xio took one note out and checked its face value.
Beside her, Fors, who appeared lazy and unbothered by money, had
also leaned over.
This is at least… Observing the thickness, Xio tried to ﬁgure out how
many notes there were.
She couldn’t help but exchange looks with Fors and saw the surprise
in each other’s eyes.
This was obviously a lot more than they had imagined!
Audrey smiled faintly and said, “A total of eight hundred pounds.
Decide how you will split the money between the two of you.
“I’m very sorry that this matter had placed you in danger.”
Eight hundred pounds… No, there’s no need to apologize. Even if we had
to do it again and knew of the possible consequences, I would still accept
the request… Even if it’s divided evenly, with my savings, it’s enough to
buy the potion formula for Sheriﬀ… Xio, who was slightly taller than
150cm, stared blankly at the notes in the envelope, wishing she could
pull them all out and count them over and over again.
She believed that the generous and beautiful Miss Audrey wouldn’t
pay them any less, but what if she had made a mistake counting?
Everyone makes mistakes at times! Xio raised her right hand, paused for
a few seconds, then silently lowered it.
The corners of Fors’s lips couldn’t help but rise as she said wistfully,
“This is even more than the royalties I’ve received for my ‘Stormwind
Mountain Villa’ so far…”
Should I praise Miss Audrey or laugh at the poverty of an author? She
added silently.
Viscount Glaint, who was sitting on the sofa, was also a little envious,
but it wasn’t directed at Xio or Fors. As a viscount with a fairly good
ﬁnancial situation, 800 pounds wasn’t a large sum.
What he envied was Audrey’s ability to hand out money without
feeling the slightest burden.
“Ahem…” Viscount Glaint cleared his throat, “If you can get the
formula for Apothecary, I will also provide you with substantial
payment.”
“We’ll do our best!” Xio answered without any hesitation. Then, she
looked at Audrey. “We’ve recently come into contact with someone
who’s suspected to be from the Psychology Alchemists, and we’ll soon
have clues regarding the Spectator potion you’re looking for.”
Xio, I’m already at Sequence 8; far stronger than you… Audrey smiled
in a reserved manner as she said, “I’m looking forward to it.”
With that said, the four began chatting about various rumors among
the Beyonder circles while following Audrey’s example of ﬁnding
books they wished to read.
Suddenly, Xio’s eyes lit up as she saw two hardcover books.
“History of the Loen Kingdom’s Aristocracy” and “Study of the Coat
of Arms”
Meanwhile, Fors also found books that interested her.
“Geography and People of the Feysac Empire” and “Traveling the
Northern Continent”
“Honorable Viscount Glaint, may I borrow these two books? I’ll
return them soon.” Xio looked pleadingly at the owner of the study.
Glaint nodded without much care.
“No problem.
At his response, Fors hurriedly made a request as well and similarly
obtained his approval.
The corners of Audrey’s mouth curved into a faint smile as she
witnessed all of this. She looked modestly to the side, pretending to
be looking for a book.
As a qualiﬁed Spectator who had just advanced, she had accurately
grasped Xio’s and Fors’s preferences in certain domains after being in
contact with them multiple times. Thus, she had made arrangements
in advance without anyone realizing it.
Letting the one being guided feel like it was done out of their own
will was a manifestation of the powers of a Spectator.
…
In the evening, Xio was curled up on the sofa in front of the ﬁreplace,
reading History of the Loen Kingdom’s Aristocracy under the gas
lamp’s illumination. Fors had gone for a gathering meant for authors.
After reading for quite a while, Xio suddenly felt something strange
about the hardback cover, so she carefully examined it and found an
interlayer where an ancient piece of paper was hidden inside.
The front side of the paper was covered with the special symbols
created by Emperor Roselle, and on the back was a paragraph written
in ancient Hermes.
“Viscount Glaint’s ancestors deciphered some of Emperor Roselle’s
special symbols?” Xio was suddenly excited.
She struggled to decipher the ancient Hermes as she muttered silently
“The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era.
“The mysterious ruler above the gray fog.
“The King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.”
Chapter 226: The Terriﬁed Xio
Cherwood Borough. 15 Minsk Street.
A satiated Klein sat in a reclining chair in the living room, beside a
ﬁreplace burning with charcoal.
In a warm environment akin to summer, Klein wore a white shirt, a
black vest, and thin trousers, while having a newspaper spread open
in front of him as he ﬂipped through the section with the most ads.
A new type of transportation vehicle is in urgent need for investments.
Details to be discussed in person… Klein read the advertisement twice
before picking up a pencil from a small, dark red table to his side and
circled the message.
If there were no commissions tomorrow or the day after, he planned
on seeing if this so-called new type of transportation vehicle had any
investment value—such matters were impossible to divine since there
was a lack of suﬃcient information.
I hope it’s a product similar to a bicycle… Klein mumbled to himself
before suddenly hearing an illusory prayer echo in his ears.
Who is it? Miss Justice? Mr. Hanged Man? The Sun? Or some clerk at the
Backlund Bank is copying my passcode? Thoughts ﬂashed through
Klein’s mind as he put down the newspaper, returned to his bedroom,
and locked the door behind him.
Taking four steps counterclockwise, he entered the world above the
gray fog. He saw that to the side of The Fool’s seat and by the edge of
the ancient mottled bronze table was a clear and bright brilliance
that emitted waves of radiance.
The experienced Klein calmly sat down and emanated his spirituality,
touching the light ripples of light in response to the prayer.
The scene in front of his eyes suddenly changed. It was a blurry sofa
with a petite woman in a knight’s trainee uniform curled up on it.
She’s not copying my passcode… She’s reading a piece of paper… Klein
suddenly realized the reason for this.
She should be one of the two Beyonders that Miss Justice mentioned that
requires my vetting…
After nearly twenty seconds of silence, Klein didn’t give any form of
formal response. He planned on taking the next step deep at night.
He would then test her reaction, attitude, and way of handling things
to test her personality and abilities.
Of course, he would absolutely not force others to join the Tarot
Club.
…
“The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era…” Xio, who had just
ﬁnished chanting the ancient Hermes sentence, froze for a few
seconds. Then, she suddenly straightened her back and sat up
straight.
This seems to be the honorary name of a hidden existence! She realized
this in horror.
Furthermore, her knowledge in mysticism and the various rumors she
had heard told her that once someone recited the full honorary name
of a hidden existence, it would often attract the attention of said
existence!
The consequences of such attention was mostly misfortune or could
even be described as tragic!
Quite a few of those hidden beings were the incarnations of the evil
gods and devils!
Furthermore, I recited it in ancient Hermes, completely unprotected… I’m
so dumb. Why did I focus so much eﬀort in identifying the sentence and
actually read it in my head… Xio looked around in horror, terriﬁed
that an indescribable monster would suddenly appear in her house.
The sofa, tea table, cupboard, dining table, chairs, oil painting, and
other items were all reﬂected in her eyes, without any changes.
After nearly a minute of heightened vigilance, Xio relaxed a little and
comforted herself, “Don’t worry, don’t be afraid. I just said the
honorable name and didn’t follow up with a prayer.
“This is an incomplete ceremony, so it shouldn’t attract any attention.
“Moreover, there’s a good chance that the name might’ve been
translated by the owner of the paper based on the special symbols left
behind by Emperor Roselle. It might not be correct.”
But, but I heard that if the evil gods and devils generate interest, they
would still provide a response even if the ceremony is incomplete… I’m so
stupid, really… As she thought over the matter, Xio’s face scrunched
up into a grimace. She felt that she had made a grave mistake.
After waiting for a few more minutes, she slowly exhaled as she
puﬀed out her cheeks when she realized that there was no obvious
response.
She stuﬀed the piece of paper back into the “History of the Loen
Kingdom’s Aristocracy” as she entered the bathroom with a heavy
heart. She turned on the faucet and tried to use the cold water to
clear her head.
Splash!
As nearly transparent water ﬂowed down, Xio hunched her back and
reached out her palms to cup some water.
Just as she was about to dab the cold water onto her face, she spotted
a long, slightly curly brown hair in the mirror through the corner of
her eye.
As for her, she had shoulder-length, unkempt yellow hair.
Suddenly, Xio’s hair stood on end.
She stomped on the ground and, with a push of her hands, she shot
backwards, turning her body halfway around and slamming the
entity with her elbow.
Pow!
She leaned against a warm body, causing the other party to let out a
familiar scream before falling to the ground.
Xio stopped any subsequent actions and looked at her good friend
who was hugging her stomach in pain, tears in her eyes.
The corner of her mouth twitched without her realizing it as she said,
“Fors, when did you get back?”
Fors didn’t reply immediately. It took her quite a while to get over
the pain. As she slowly stood up, using the wall as a support, she
grumbled, “I j-just got back. Xio, are you nuts!? Why did you attack
me without even looking clearly! And you hit me so hard!”
“Where did you come in from?” Xio asked awkwardly.
“Through the bathroom window. Why? Is there a problem? As an
Apprentice, it’s normal to not bring a key with me,” Fors replied
matter-of-factly.
Xio straightened her back and pushed away all responsibility.
“Then why didn’t you go through the door? You really gave me a
fright just now!”
Fors blinked her eyes and said, “If that’s the case, I’ll have to make
one big round. That’s too troublesome; I’m used to walking in a
straight line.”
She paused as she asked suspiciously, “However, wasn’t your reaction
a bit too much?”
Xio struggled for three seconds, choosing between losing her dignity
or losing her life, before answering honestly, “It-it’s because I made a
mistake, a fatal mistake.”
“What mistake?” Fors asked, rubbing her belly as she felt puzzled and
concerned.
Xio hurriedly recounted the whole story of how she had discovered
the interlayer in the book’s cover and found an old piece of paper in
it. Then, she had accidentally recited the suspected incantation in
ancient Hermes silently. What she had recited seemed to contain the
honorable name of some hidden existence.
“You… Where’s your brain? It-it should be ﬁne. The ceremony wasn’t
complete, and who knows if it’s real or fake…” Fors looked around,
and for some baﬄing reason, she felt a chill.
She followed Xio back to the living room and saw the yellowed sheet
of paper, as well as Roselle’s special symbols, and the sentence that
was written in ancient Hermes.
After a quick glance, Fors, the professional researcher in mysticism,
nodded and said, “It’s not any of the evil gods, devils, and secret
existences that I know of. It should be ﬁne.
“Furthermore, nothing has happened up till now. That means that
everything should be ﬁne.”
Seeing Xio relax, she thought of the pain in her stomach, so she
deliberately added maliciously, “Of course, if something were to
really happen, there’s no way we can rescue ourselves with our
meager abilities.”
Xio’s face paled as she blurted out, “Fors, let’s sleep together tonight.
Forget it, I’ll just sleep on my own…”
Fors pricked up her brows and chuckled, “Alright. In fact, you don’t
have to worry about it. Think about it, I hear strange murmurs
whenever there’s a full moon, but I don’t see any signs me going mad
or losing control.
“Well… We should study the other three books. If there’s the same
piece of paper and the same incantation, it means that it’s very likely
to be a prank from Viscount Glaint.”
The duo hurriedly ﬂipped through “Study of the Coat of Arms” and
the other books and checked them carefully, but they didn’t ﬁnd
anything else out of the ordinary.
Xio looked at Fors, who looked back at her, turning the mood somber
again.
“Should we sneak into Saint Samuel Cathedral’s nave tonight?” Xio
came up with an inspired suggestion.
That was the headquarters of the Church of the Evernight Goddess in
the Backlund diocese.
“Why not Saint Hierländ Cathedral? I don’t think the Evernight
Goddess will protect me…” Fors subconsciously replied.
That was the headquarters of the Church of the God of Steam and
Machinery, which was located in the St. George Borough, adjacent to
many huge factories in the southeast.
The two ladies with diﬀerent faiths fell silent again, and after a
while, Fors sighed and said, “And that would make us end up being
targeted by the Nighthawks or the Machinery Hivemind. That might
be the goal of that hidden existence.
“Alright, go to sleep. We’ll know the answer tomorrow morning. If
nothing happens by then, it means that it’ll really be okay.”
…
In the middle of the night, the waxing crimson moon was obscured
by clouds, and the stars were barely visible in the sky above
Backlund.
Klein instinctively woke up, lifted his blanket, got oﬀ the bed, and
entered the world above the gray fog.
He sat down on the high back chair that belonged to The Fool. He
planned on responding to Miss Justice’s companion and proceed with
the ‘examination process.’
At that moment, he suddenly had a new idea.
Perhaps he could try and see if he could pull her into the world above
the gray fog under the present circumstances!
The young lady must have fallen asleep, and even if I succeed, she would
probably treat it as a dream that appears clearer than usual… Hmm… If I
succeed, I can sever the connection in a timely manner to prevent her from
seeing her surroundings clearly…
After repeatedly deliberating over the matter, Klein stretched out his
hand and tapped at the rippling ring of light to form a connection
with it.
Suddenly, Klein felt his spirituality surge out in an unstoppable
manner, causing the mysterious space above the gray fog to tremble
slightly.
Just when Klein thought that his spirituality would be completely
drained, everything calmed down. A blurry, distorted ﬁgure appeared
at the edge of the long bronze table.
In her reverie, Xio opened her eyes sleepily and saw the endless fog,
the ancient high back chair, and a dark ﬁgure watching her.
Klein was overjoyed and immediately severed the connection
according to his plan.
The hazy, petite ﬁgure disappeared, but within the grayish-white
mist, a crimson, illusory star appeared.
Klein looked at this scene and conﬁrmed one thing. As long as
someone chanted his name, he would be able to pull that person into
the world above the gray fog. The crimson star was a symbol of a
stable connection.
However, there are certain limitations. With my current strength, at most,
I can establish another connection… Hmm… Based on my previous
experiences, my current spirituality can only pull in Beyonders who are a
Sequence higher than me, and it won’t necessarily be a success. It’s just a
preliminary judgment, so it shouldn’t be a problem if it’s someone at the
same Sequence as me or lower… Klein thought, feeling satisﬁed.
There was no need for him to respond. His attempt was already
enough.
…
Xio sat up in her sleep.
She had been worrying about the potential dangers of chanting an
honorary name the entire time. Not long after she fell asleep, she
dreamed of a mysterious space, and a gray foggy ﬁgure looking down
on her from above.
The dream was so clear, so clear that Xio felt afraid.
She looked at the sleeping Fors beside her and thought with a
tremble, Is it a nightmare caused by fear, or is it because of the attention
I garnered from some hidden existence, resulting in being haunted by evil
spirits?
Yes… There’s going to be a gathering of Beyonders tomorrow night. In
addition to buying the formula, I need to ﬁnd a person who is good at
exorcising evil spirits to purify myself.
Chapter 227: Inventor Leppard
Sitting at his own dining table on a foggy morning, Klein broke up his
specially bought wheat bread and soaked it in milk, improving the
way he ate it.
Although his body had changed a long time ago, his pursuit and
obsession with delicacies were engraved into his soul. He was
completely unable to adapt to the Loen Kingdom’s monotonous and
repetitive style of breakfast. He could only try his best at
experimenting. He tried not to limit himself to toast, bread, bacon,
sausages, and butter. He tried hard to expand the boundaries and
improve the way he ate. For example, his recipes had new additions
such as pork-ﬁlled pastries from the south, Feynapotter noodles, and
roasted corn pastries.
“Caviar from the Feysac Empire isn’t bad either, but it’s too
expensive. It’s only suitable for formal meals…” Klein scooped up a
small piece of wheat bread he had softened and put it in his mouth.
Just by chewing it a little, he could feel the intertwining ﬂavors of
milk with the fragrance of wheat. The aftertaste of the bread was
even sweeter.
After breakfast, Klein put down his cutlery, but he was in no hurry to
tidy up the table. He picked up the newspapers, and began to read.
I’ll do a divination in a while. If there’s nothing else to do, I’ll pay Mr.
Leppard a visit at St. George Borough’s Sird Street and see if his new
transportation vehicle is worth investing in… Backlund is really big. Every
borough is almost the size of Tingen City. The East Borough is especially
ridiculous. It’s at least twice as large… The easiest and most economical
way to travel is to walk, followed by the steam metro, before walking
again. It’s just quite a waste of time… Klein’s mind wandered aimlessly.
Backlund’s public horse carriage system was rather similar to
Tingen’s. The price was about the same, but the only problem was
that most of them were conﬁned to a single borough. If one wanted
to go from Cherwood to St. George, a few transfers were needed and
that would naturally raise the price.
Such a situation made the prospects for a new transportation vehicle
very alluring.
Knock! Knock! Knock!
At that moment, knocks on the door sounded. It was as loud as the
pounding of a hammer.
Who is it… Don’t they know how to ring the doorbell… He muttered a
few words, straightened his collar, walked to the door, and pulled it
open.
In front of him was a familiar face. It was the highlander man who
had chased Ian at the steam metro. His skin was dark, his eye sockets
recessed, and he was lean and hardy man.
According to Klein’s mediumship results, the man’s name was
Meursault, an “executioner” of the Zmanger gang who was almost
equal to the boss.
“Excuse me, who are you looking for? Do you have a commission to
entrust with me?” Klein deliberately acted somewhat confused.
Meursault was wearing a black coat and a pompous silk hat, but he
didn’t look anything like a gentleman at all.
He coldly sized Klein up, then he asked in Loen, with a thick
highlander accent, “Are you Detective Sherlock Moriarty?”
“Yes,” Klein replied short and sweet.
Meursault nodded his head stiﬄy.
“I want to hire you to ﬁnd someone.”
“We can talk about the exact situation inside.” Klein prevented
himself from acting odd in any way.
Meursault shook his head coldly.
“There’s no need.”
After saying that, his eyes suddenly became sharp.
“The person I’m looking for is called Ian. Ian Wright. He has a pair of
bright red eyes, maybe ﬁfteen or sixteen. He likes to wear a brown,
old coat and a round hat of the same color. I believe you know him.”
Klein let out a soft chuckle.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Meursault seemed to ignore Klein’s denial. “He’s a thief who has
stolen an important item from me. If you can ﬁnd him, you’ll be paid
at least 10 pounds.”
“You’ve provided too few clues.” Klein made up an excuse.
“30 pounds.” Meursault made a new oﬀer.
Klein glanced at him and said, “No, this is against my principle of
conﬁdentiality.”
“50 pounds,” Meursault replied coldly.
“… I’m sorry, I cannot accept the mission.” Klein was startled for two
seconds, but in the end, he still chose to reject the request.
Meursault studied him slowly for a few seconds as his eyes slowly
turned cold and ﬁerce.
He didn’t oﬀer a new price, nor did he politely bid farewell. He
turned around abruptly and walked quickly to the end of the street.
This gang has pretty good intelligence… They actually know that Ian had
come to me once… Klein secretly sighed, full of emotion, but he didn’t
feel too much anxiety or fear.
After all, I’m someone who once directly faced the son of an evil god,
although, it was separated by a belly… As he thought about it, his smile
suddenly became brilliant. He began ﬂipping a coin to decide
whether or not he was going out today.
The answer was positive.
…
St. George Borough, Sird Street.
Having transferred from a tracked public carriage to the steam metro,
before transferring to a trackless carriage, Klein ﬁnally arrived at his
destination, spending a total of 11 pence.
Just after he alighted the carriage, he discovered that a drizzle had
already started, but he hadn’t brought an umbrella.
According to the newspapers and magazines, this is a daily
occurrence in Backlund. The reason why hats are popular is that
ladies and gentlemen don’t carry umbrellas all the time. Klein pressed
down on his half top hat and briskly ran outside Unit 9 and used the
eaves to shield himself from the rain.
He brushed oﬀ the obvious water droplets from his body and rang the
doorbell.
However, he didn’t hear any cuckoo sounds or tinkling sounds.
Is the doorbell broken? Klein was just about to raise his hand to knock
when he suddenly saw footsteps approaching from afar.
The image of the person naturally appeared in his mind. It was a tall,
thin man with black hair and blue eyes. He was in his thirties and
was dressed in grayish-blue worker attire, but he appeared gentle and
reﬁned.
Creak. The door opened. The gentleman rubbed his forehead and
asked, “May I know who you are looking for? Is there something?”
Klein took oﬀ his hat and bowed slightly.
“I’m here to ﬁnd Mr. Leppard. I’m interested in his new
transportation vehicle.”
The gentleman’s eyes suddenly lit up.
“I’m Leppard. Come in, please.”
He turned to the side and allowed Klein entry. However, there was no
coat rack in the foyer.
Klein could only lean his cane and not take oﬀ his coat. He followed
Leppard into the living room.
It had to be said that the gentleman’s house was very messy. On the
coﬀee table in the living room alone were many mechanical objects,
such as wrenches, bearings and screwdrivers.
“How much do you wish to invest? Ah, right. Would you like some
coﬀee or black tea? Uh… it seems I’m out of black tea…” Leppard
blurted out.
This gentleman is a bit straightforward, and doesn’t seem to be very good
at interpersonal relationships… A thought ﬂashed through Klein’s
mind, and he changed the words he planned on saying. He went
straight to the point, “I’ve to see your new transportation vehicle
before I make a decision.
“I can’t make any promises without understanding anything.”
As he spoke, he looked around and saw a triangular Sacred Emblem
hanging on the wall.
That was the symbol of the God of Steam and Machinery. The solid
triangle was ﬁlled with symbols such as steam, gears, and levers.
Leppard wasn’t irritated by Klein’s straightforwardness. He
immediately said, “I’ll show you.”
As soon as he said that, he slapped his head. “I almost forgot, we
have to sign a non-disclosure agreement to ensure that you don’t
steal my invention.”
Mr. Leppard, you don’t have a very good memory either… Klein smiled
and said, “That wouldn’t be an issue.”
After signing the simple contract, Leppard led Klein into a room that
seemed like an activity room. He had knocked through the
neighboring guest room and basement, making it much wider and
spacious.
The ground was littered with components, and a rough object, that
was half the height of a man, that resembled a carriage stood in the
center.
In addition to that, the line of the doorbell was connected there and
was cleverly constructed. As long as someone pulled the rope, a steel
ball would pop out from the mechanism, allowing it to roll along a
special track before colliding with the object in the center to produce
a clanging sound.
The sound certainly wasn’t too loud, but it was enough to rouse
Leppard who was engrossed in machinery.
“Is that the new form of transportation you invented?” Klein pointed
to the crude object in the middle of the room.
“Yes, I invented it based on Emperor Roselle’s imagination!” He
replied with a fervent look in his eyes.
“Emperor Roselle’s imagination?” Klein asked in surprise.
Leppard explained in a tone of adoration, “Emperor Roselle left
behind a number of manuscripts in which he drew his vision of the
machines of the future. He was an outstanding genius, no—a master!
Many things have already been turned into reality! “Heh heh, this
manuscript is kept in the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery.
There’s no way for non pious believers to borrow them.”
… Emperor, are you still leaving no stones unturned for others… Klein’s
mouth twitched, almost unable to maintain his smile.
“Describe it in detail.” He changed the subject.
Leppard led Klein to the crude metallic object and opened the door.
“This is a transportation tool that doesn’t need a horse.
“The driver sits in the front left seat, continuously stepping on the
pedals. Through the levers and a chain connects to the four wheels,
allowing the vehicle to roll forward. And on the wheels, I used
inﬂated rubber which can make the journey smooth.”
So it’s a human-powered car? Klein couldn’t help but lampoon.
He said with some deliberation, “With such a huge carriage, and at
least four passengers, it would be impossible to travel that far just by
relying on human strength alone.”
“That’s exactly my next goal—to reduce the weight and expand the
lever a few times! However, my ﬁnancial situation isn’t at its best. I
can’t fund any more attempts.” Leppard looked hopefully at Klein.
“Why not consider other methods? Such as using steam as the driving
force?” Klein slowly organized his words.
Leppard shook his head. “There have been people who have invented
that, but it has a very huge body, making it diﬃcult to drive it along
many streets.”
That was exactly what Klein was waiting for.
“Then, why don’t you just do something simpler? For example, have
only two wheels with only one person without an outer shell.”
“You mean something like a bicycle?” Leppard asked in thought.
Roselle’s manuscript has that? Klein nodded heavily.
“Yes.”
“Those bicycles which other people have invented aren’t very
practical… Simplifying this… seems like it might work. It will really
seem diﬀerent. But, who would buy it?” Leppard said to himself.
Klein didn’t hesitate to provide him with a direction.
“The postman, the working class who have a bit of savings, the
businessmen who doesn’t need to look respectable while hoping to
save money… There are many of them in Backlund.”
Leppard thought for a moment, then nodded slightly.
“… I can try, but I don’t have the money for spare parts…”
“I’ll invest 100 gold pounds. In addition to my suggestion just now,
I’ll take a total of…” Klein hesitated to say ten percent of the shares.
Fifteen percent was better. After all, a hundred pounds was, strictly
speaking, not much.
“You can have 35% of the shares! But that’s only limited to the
bicycle concept you described!” Leppard spoke out ﬁrst, afraid that
Klein would make an unreasonable request.
“Deal!” Klein immediately laughed. “We’ll ﬁrst draw up a simple
contract and settle this matter. Afterwards, I’ll ﬁnd a lawyer to make
a formal contract and add some detailed terms. For example, if
there’s anyone else who wants to invest, they must ﬁrst get my
consent.”
“No problem,” Leppard replied impatiently. All he wanted was to buy
his spare parts as soon as possible.
…
In the gloominess brought about by the drizzle, Klein returned to
Cherwood Borough’s Minsk Street.
He entered the house and went straight to the bathroom on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor and resolved the problem of his bloated stomach.
Splash.
As the water echoed, Klein bent down to wash his hands.
At that moment, an image appeared in his mind.
The mirror in front of the sink reﬂected his lowered head, dim
surroundings, and a pair of eyes to his side.
A pair of eyes!
Chapter 228: The Mastermind
Almost instinctively, Klein bent his knees and rolled sideways toward
the bathroom door.
Sou!
A small black-feathered arrow stabbed into the wash basin. The
arrow seemed to be made of bone and suﬀused a blue luster. It was
extremely beautiful.
If Klein had hesitated in any way, he deﬁnitely wouldn’t have been
able to escape this sudden attack!
After rolling for a moment, Klein reached into his pocket and
attempted to pull out a few tarot cards.
But at that moment, he felt a gust of wind engulf him. Through the
corner of his eyes, he saw a black ﬁgure quickly closing in on him at
high speeds. It appeared in front of him in an extraordinary pose, as
he tightened his foot and kicked out from bottom to top.
Realizing that he couldn’t avoid the attack, Klein quickly gave up on
his previous intentions and used his elbow to block the attack.
With a bang, he felt his entire left arm go numb, and his body was
yanked over, just like in the sport squash, that the middle class loved
to play the most, or like a soccer ball that was now popular among
the lower class.
What immense strength! Klein’s heart tightened. Without being
ﬂustered, he adjusted his body in midair and changed his posture,
barely maintaining his balance as if he was performing acrobatics.
Pa! Pa! Pa… At this moment, a tree-bark-colored blow-pipe had just
landed on the ﬂoor of the bathroom and bounced behind the door, at
a declining speed.
Just as Klein was about to stretch out his body to ﬁrmly stand and
face the follow-up attack, a scene suddenly ﬂashed in his mind.
The speed of the enemy in black far exceeded his expectations,
arriving even faster than he had expected. He lowered his body and
swung his arm, striking him in the chest.
In the blink of an eye, Klein’s body bent over, spinning half a circle
more, like a small ball that kept falling and kept being thrown
around.
Pow!
He stretched out his hand and pressed it to the ground, opening his
legs like scissors while keeping his head low. It made black-clothed
man’s ﬁst miss as it tore through empty space.
The ﬁst that was originally aimed at his chest could only hit his legs
after Klein turned his body, but his legs were opened wide.
Pushing up, his legs closed in together, allowing Klein to leap nimbly
to the side as he ﬁnally managed to stand up straight.
Pow!
Before he had the chance to observe his enemy, the black ﬁgure had
already arrived in front of him, bringing with it a strong gust of wind.
What a fast reaction! Klein quickly lifted his arms up in front of him to
block.
With a dull thud, he felt as if he had collided with a black bear.
Failing to withstand the immense force, he could only stagger
backward, his arms almost turning numb in the process.
At the same time, Klein ﬁnally recognized his attacker.
He had dark skin, a lean and hardy build with recessed eye sockets.
He was none other than the “executioner” of the Zmanger gang,
Meursault, the person who had come to see Detective Moriarty in the
morning!
Pa! Pa! Pa! With a ﬁerce glint in his eyes, Meursault closely pursued
after him as he ﬂung both of his arms, delivering left hooks or right
punches in a barrage of attacks at Klein.
The gap between Klein’s strength and that of his opponent was
obvious. He was unable to face him head on, and he had to rely on
his agility and premonitory senses to barely avoid the combo of
punches.
No! I have to make full use of my advantages! With a similar thought,
Klein stopped engaging in melee combat. He lowered his body and
rolled to the side.
Crack! A chair was torn apart by Meursault’s kick.
Klein supported his body with one hand as he exerted strength in his
waist and continued rolling in a bid to seek a chance to use his tarot
cards and self-made charms.
Tap! Tap! Tap!
Meursault caught up quickly and kicked out his legs, one after
another, that was in no way slower than his opponent.
He was like a giant bear with the gift of agility and had zero
weaknesses. He made it so that the rolling Klein was only capable of
focusing on dodging and defending, without giving him the chance to
draw his cards or use his charms.
Kacha! Bam! Bam!
A chair was broken, the table overturned, the coat rack toppled, and
Klein had circled most of the way around, but his situation was
turning dire.
I can’t go on like this! He kept dodging, rolling and tumbling, seeking
every opportunity to turn the situation around.
Suddenly, an idea came to him when he spotted the coﬀee table in
the living room through the corner of his eyes.
Bam! Klein defended a blow with one arm as jumped back towards
the living room while enduring the pain.
At this moment, Meursault’s leg muscles bulged suddenly like they
were inﬂated with air.
Boom! He stepped on the ground so hard that it seemed to shake, and
he jumped up and shot at Klein like a bullet, with one of his legs
aimed at him.
Klein barely managed to hold on for a moment before being sent
ﬂying again, crashing through the coﬀee table with a clang, sending
the ceramic tea set ﬂying towards the cupboard, scattering the round
fountain pens, the contract template, and the various newspapers on
the ﬂoor.
Seeing that the detective in the black double-breasted coat was
weakened from the impact and momentarily unable to stand up or
roll, a ﬁerce glint ﬂashed in Meursault’s eyes. He slid forward,
pushing his knee out amidst the shattering sounds of the porcelain.
Klein’s eyes turned dark as he watched this scene. He was already
holding a contract template in his hands.
He had ﬂed to the coﬀee table in the living room, ignoring the
warnings his premonition was giving him, solely to pick up a contract
template or newspaper!
When he saw Meursault’s knee coming at him, Klein’s wrist shook.
At that moment, a scene appeared in his mind once again, a scene
with Meursault’s neck twisted backward.
Sou!
Klein slightly pressed his wrist, shaking out the contract template in
his hand.
Sou!
The contract was like a dart made of ﬁne steel as it shot at
Meursault’s throat. At that moment, the distance between the two of
them was less than a meter. Moreover, as Meursault closed in, the
distance between them was decreasing!
A white item was reﬂected in Meursault’s eyes as he instinctively
tried to jump back to dodge it.
Oof!
The contract stabbed right through Meursault’s throat, penetrating
his windpipe.
Blood with patches of bubbling blood gushed out as Meursault fell in
front of Klein, his knees heavily hitting the ground.
“Huﬀ… Huﬀ… Huﬀ…” He pulled out the bloodied contract template
and clutched his throat.
However, he was unable to stop the blood from ﬂowing out of his
wound, and his eyes gradually became unfocused.
In the end, his body twitched a few times, and he stopped moving.
Klein took a moment to recover before he had the strength to turn
around and stand up. He had a few tarot cards between his ﬁngers,
on guard against possible counterattacks and other enemies.
After activating his Spirit Vision and conﬁrming that his assailant was
dead, Klein looked around and didn’t see any other auras.
Only then did he relax a little. He noticed that two of the chairs were
broken, the coﬀee table was smashed up in several spots, and
porcelain was strewn all over the ﬂoor. The entire living room, dining
room, and foyer were in a mess.
Lowering his head, he saw that the sleeves of his suit had been
damaged and that the outer layer of the cloth had been stained with
a great deal of dust.
Suddenly, Klein said softly in a self-deprecating manner, “There’s no
way to claim reimbursement for this…
“Haha. Hahaha. Hahaha.”
He laughed as if he had encountered something that could amuse him
for the rest of his life. He laughed so hard that his body bent forward
and backward, to the point where only his laughter reverberated in
the entire house.
A few seconds later, Klein stopped smiling and walked to the corpse
with a heavy expression.
He wanted to make the dead speak!
Being familiar with the mediumship ritual and answering his own
prayers, Klein took of a whiﬀ of the refreshing fragrance and used the
technique of dream divination to whisper, “The mastermind who sent
Meursault on this mission.”
Soon, his eyes turned black as he entered a dream and saw a gray
blur.
Suddenly, the gray and blurry world and lit ﬁgures changed, forming
numerous scenes and images before him.
In front of Meursault was a middle-aged man without a hat. His
white shirt had a complicated, layered, petal-shaped collar and cuﬀs,
which made him look very magniﬁcent. Matched with a tight black
vest and skinny trousers, he looked gaudy and exaggerated.
This middle-aged man had brown hair and blue eyes, a thin face with
a stubble. He was a very good-looking gentleman.
He looked at Meursault and said in a deep voice, “No matter what
you do, make sure you ﬁnd Ian Wright alive. If he’s dead, bring him
to me within an hour, preferably within ﬁfteen minutes.”
“Yes, Mr. Ambassador.” Meursault didn’t hide his unruliness but still
kept his head lowered.
The scene shattered, and Klein frowned.
Mr. Ambassador?
This matter actually involves other countries?
Judging by the style of the shirt, the ambassador is most likely the
ambassador of the Intis Republic to Backlund.
Ian is only a teenage boy…
That gentleman is able to channel spirits, or at least he has someone
around him who can do so…
Klein thought for a moment, then constructed another sentence for
the dream divination.
“The reason for ﬁnding Ian Wright.”
In the grayish blurry dream, Klein once again saw the middle-aged
gentleman from before.
He stared at Meursault and said in a low voice, “You don’t need to
know why. Just heed my instructions.
“I gave you the potion and money to become the person in power
behind the Zmanger gang; not for you to raise questions, but for you
to do things!
“Yes… You only need to know that Ian Wright might be involved in
an item of great importance.”
As the scene faded away, Klein once again exited the dream.
An item of great importance… I really can’t tell, Ian… What could it be…
Potion… So Meursault is actually a Beyonder. It’s no wonder that his
combat skills were so powerful and terrifying. He should be a Beyonder
adept in this ﬁeld… As these thoughts crossed his mind, Klein felt
exhausted. It seemed that responding to his own request had
consumed too much of his spirituality.
If he wanted to have his mediumship standards restored to what it
was previously, he estimated that it would only happen when he was
a Sequence 7.
After ending the ritual and dispelling the wall of spirituality, Klein
looked at Meursault’s corpse and carefully observed it for a long time.
Finally, he saw specks of spiritual radiance converging at the wound
on his opponent’s throat, slowly congealing into a piece.
Carefully grabbing it, Klein pulled out a dark red object that looked
like jelly from Earth.
Is this the Beyonder characteristic left behind by Meursault? I wonder
what kind of Sequence potion it is… That’s easy to determine. I’ll get the
answer by doing a divination above the gray fog… Theoretically speaking,
the Beyonder characteristic of Low-Sequence Beyonders will be able to
imbue a person with the corresponding powers, even without the
supplementary ingredients. However, one can easily lose control and go
insane on the spot after consuming it… Nearly all the supplementary
ingredients for low Sequence potions lack spirituality… Klein’s thoughts
ran wild before he ﬁnally forced himself to focus.
A corpse was now in front of him. It gave him a headache thinking
about what he should do next.
Chapter 229: Lesser of Two Evils
Meursault’s body lay there, his eyes wide open, as if he still had a
murderous look in them.
The wound that had severed half his throat was originally thin, but
with the condensation of the Beyonder characteristic, it had
expanded by quite a bit and became much more mangled.
At the same time, the phenomenon of incontinence after death made
his lower body reek of a stench.
Klein held onto the crimson jelly-like object, feeling troubled about
what he should do next.
He had three general choices. The ﬁrst was to clean up the scene,
deal with his wounds, and to report it to the police in the name of
legitimate self-defense. The second was to wait deep into night,
throw the corpse into some sewer, and pretend that nothing had
happened. The third was to immediately give up his current identity,
ﬂee to another borough, and change his name again.
The problem with the ﬁrst option was that Klein was still an illegal
resident with skeletons in his closet. Reporting it to the police could
easily lead to discovering a problem with his identity. As for the
second option, other than being constantly worried that the corpse
would be found and that the police would come knocking on his
door, there was another hidden danger.
When the ambassador behind Meursault conﬁrms the disappearance
or death of his subordinate, he would deﬁnitely send someone else to
15 Minsk Street again. When that happens, Klein would be facing
perhaps a Sequence 7 and/or Sequence 6 enemy. He was facing a
faction that might very well be a country, a powerful country.
The third option seemed to be the wisest and safest option that
allowed him to avoid all the risks, but there was also a downside, and
that was that the portrait of Klein was likely to be posted, making
him wanted. Furthermore, it would be a portrait of his undisguised
self which Mrs. Sammer next door, his neighbor Lawyer Jurgen, and
others would describe. Once the wanted notice was published in the
corresponding newspapers, even if it was limited to the greater
Backlund area, Klein would very likely be recognized by Daly and the
other Nighthawks. That would make the problem become even more
troublesome.
As this matter involved Ince Zengwell and Sealed Artifact 0-08, it was
highly likely that he would be pursued by an expert at the level of a
high-ranking deacon.
Of course, the third option had a separate branch which was, of
course, to hide the body and dump the evidence into the sewers, and
then try to escape. However, there was also the risk of becoming
wanted when the ambassador couldn’t ﬁnd Klein. He could order the
members of the Zmanger gang to call the police and use the oﬃcial
forces of Backlund to search—and if he could track Klein down, that
would be the same as the second option.
After thinking about it, Klein quickly came to a decision: Divination…
Of course, he was inclined towards a particular option already, the
lesser of two evils. The ﬁrst option was relatively less risky, and it
allowed him to take the initiative to a certain extent. Through
exposure, he could attract the attention of the oﬃcial factions and
suppress the Ambassador’s subsequent actions from being too
maniacal.
He took out a piece of paper and wrote a divination statement. After
that, Klein took out a spirit pendulum from his left wrist, causing the
topaz pendant to naturally hang down over the surface of the paper.
“I should make a police report.
“I should make a police report.”
…
After he ﬁnished his silent incantation, he saw the spirit pendulum
rotating clockwise with weak amplitudes and a relatively high
frequency.
This indicated a positive response!
After divining the other two choices in turn and obtaining a negative
answer from both of them, Klein no longer hesitated and began to
deal with the scene.
He put on a pair of black gloves and began to search the corpse. He
found a sharp dagger, a small stack of cash, a pack of cigarettes, a
lighter, and some miscellaneous items.
Klein put the rest of the items back in place, took oﬀ his gloves, held
the dagger in his hand, and stabbed it into Meursault’s throat wound,
destroying its original shape.
Then, he wore his gloves and let Meursault grab the dagger.
After doing all of this, Klein gathered together the Meursault’s
Beyonder characteristic, the self-made charms, the tarot cards, the
blood-stained contract, the paper on which the divination was
written, and the various materials he carried around with him, and
put them in a paper bag.
Then, he summoned himself in a ritual and transformed into a special
spirit.
Carrying Azik’s copper whistle, he felt himself become stronger and
more corporeal. Klein picked up the paper bag, ended the
summoning, and returned to the world above the gray fog.
He placed the items from reality behind The Fool’s high back chair
for the time being, leaving Azik’s copper whistle as well. Then he
relaxed himself as he stimulated the sensation of descending rapidly
and re-entered his own body.
The reason why Klein didn’t burn the blood-stained contract and the
piece of paper on which he had written the divination statement was
because he was afraid that after the report was sent to the police, the
matter would be transferred to a special department, and a powerful
Beyonder would engage in divination pertaining to the situation.
However, with the gray fog’s interference, even if the Eternal Blazing
Sun were to personally descend, “He” wouldn’t be able to obtain a
productive answer.
This was also the reason why Klein placed his weekly review and
summary above the gray fog after his spirituality was greatly
enhanced after advancing to Sequence 8.
Right now, he couldn’t aﬀord to take on more suspicion and deeper
investigations!
After removing the wall of spirituality, the wind that suddenly stirred
blew away the remaining smell of the ritualistic materials. The items
related to the domain of mysticism and Beyonders that were left
behind on Klein’s body and in the entire house were the candles that
were silently burning in front of him.
But this time, he chose ordinary candles. Since he was praying and
summoning himself, there was no need to be so meticulous.
And in a family, having candles was a very normal thing that
matched the era, even if he was the only bachelor in the family.
After extinguishing the candles and returning them to their original
spot, Klein took out his golden pocket watch, snapped it open, and
estimated the number of minutes since Meursault’s death and added
the minimum amount of time it would take for the police to send
people to investigate and report back.
He wanted to ensure that even if a Beyonder came to investigate, an
hour would have passed since Meursault’s death.
In mysticism and in the domain of spirit-channeling, this was an
important time point. Beyond it, the information available was very
limited and vague. For example, one could discover, through
mediumship, that the person who killed Meursault was Sherlock
Moriarty; however, they couldn’t get the speciﬁcs of the death.
As for whether or not his opponents could divine if Beyonders were
involved, Klein wasn’t worried at all, because the main factors
involved (the bloodied template contract) were above the gray fog.
Even his premonition and combat abilities would also be obscured as
the opponent’s divination would deﬁnitely point towards the
mysterious space above the gray fog, and would certainly suﬀer from
interference.
Fortunately, I’m also a professional… It feels like I’ve really become
Moriarty… Klein re-examined the scene, making sure that there were
no problems, and began to walk with his eyes ﬁxed on his pocket
watch.
After the estimated time, he put on his gold-rimmed glasses and
waited for a few minutes before he opened the door and went out.
The sky in Backlund had already gone dark, and the gas lamps on the
street lit up the rain.
As a middle-class neighborhood, Minsk Street was often patrolled by
the police. Klein waited for a while, then spotted the target and went
up to meet them.
They were two low-ranking constables with only one chevron on
their Paulette. They held guns, batons, and were holding up an
umbrella while looking around.
“Oﬃcers! A criminal attacked me! ” Klein shouted with great skill.
His unkempt appearance made the two constables place importance
on the matter. They each took out their batons and looked warily to
the side.
“Where’s the criminal?” the round-faced, brown-eyed cop asked in a
deep voice.
Klein pointed to his house.
“He sneaked into my home and tried to kill me!
“In the ﬁght, I accidentally stabbed him to death!”
Stabbed him to death… The two constables exchanged looks and
looked at Klein with scrutiny.
“Take us there.”
“Alright!” Klein acted like he had just survived a disaster as he led
the two oﬃcers to 15 Minsk Street, took out his key, and opened the
door.
The two police constables ﬁrst saw the chaotic scene before noticing
the corpse laying on the ground. They noticed the hideous wound on
the deceased’s throat, and noticed a bloody dagger.
“Watch the scene, I’ll return to the station and report it to the
inspector,” another constable said to his round-faced, brown-eyed
colleague.
“Alright.” The round-faced, brown-eyed constable cast his gaze on at
Klein, his face and body language revealing his wariness and caution.
After a while, a sergeant dressed in black-and-white checkered
uniform with three chevrons on his epaulet arrived with the
constable from before and two other subordinates.
The constables investigated the scene and while searching for clues,
the sergeant with a short brownish-yellow beard under his chin
brought Klein to the side and began asking some preliminary
questions.
“Name.”
“Sherlock Moriarty. This is my rental receipt for half a year.” Klein
had long prepared all of this.
The sergeant gave him a casual look and continued asking, “What’s
your occupation?”
“Private detective,” answered Klein frankly.
The sergeant frowned and said, “Do you know the deceased? Do you
know why he attacked you?”
“I know him. His name is Meursault, and he’s the executioner of the
Zmanger gang.” Klein didn’t wait for the sergeant to ask any further
questions as he continued, “I had previously accepted a job from Ian
Wright who asked me to investigate his former employer, Detective
Zreal Victor Lee. This matter happened to be related to the Zmanger
gang and Meursault.
“I tailed him and found out that he was secretly meeting a gentleman
who appeared to be of signiﬁcant standing. Meursault addressed him
as Mr. Ambassador.” After saying that, Klein was unsurprised to see
the sergeant’s expression change.
“Ambassador… Do you know his name?” the sergeant asked in a
deep voice.
“I don’t know, but if I saw his picture, I’d deﬁnitely recognize him,”
Klein told the truth. “This morning, Meursault came to me and asked
me to seek Ian Wright. On the basis of my professional ethics as a
private detective, I refused him, and when I got home in the evening,
I was attacked and almost killed by him. Thankfully, I’m still quite
skilled at combat and was suﬃciently quick to react.”
The sergeant thought for a moment and asked for details of the ﬁght.
Klein recounted the ﬁght from beginning to end nearly in its entirety,
changing his premonition to a reaction, then changing the contract
template he had thrown in the ﬁght into a dagger that Meursault had
dropped.
“Yea… Follow us back to the police station and wait for the autopsy
results, the results of the on-site investigation, and inquiries from the
relevant parties involved.” The sergeant’s thoughts wasn’t on the case
anymore, clearly acting rather perfunctory.
Right now, he only had one thought in his mind:
This was an important case involving foreign ambassadors!
He had to report it immediately!
In his daze, he suddenly thought of a question and quickly added,
“What’s your faith?”
“God of Steam and Machinery,” Klein replied without hesitation.
The Backlund headquarters of the Church of the Lord of Storms was
in the Cherwood Borough, so cases involving Beyonders were often
referred to them, with one exception—the people involved had to be
believers of the Lord of Storms.
In order to not encounter the Nighthawks, Klein had no choice but to
let the Goddess down.
Chapter 230: Interrogation
Empress Borough. In an unremarkable house.
Xio and Fors took a seat at random and examined the writing on the
blackboard. Like always, Mr. A was sitting quietly, alone on the sofa
at the front in his hooded robe, looking down at the crowd from a
high vantage point.
Sequence 8 Sheriﬀ potion formula. 450 pounds… Xio silently read the
familiar content as she inwardly let out of sigh of relief.
The situation she feared the most was the lack of a seller when she
had ﬁnally amassed the money with great diﬃculty!
I received 400 pounds from the split, plus my original savings of 150
pounds, that’s enough… However, I’d deﬁnitely need a huge sum of
money for the main ingredient… Ah right, maybe I can change circles and
see if there are any Beyonders who are interested in this formula… Xio
suddenly felt invigorated, and she realized that she had found a way
to make a fortune.
Frankly speaking, there was no way she would leak the formula if she
wasn’t in desperate need for money to buy the materials to concoct
the potion. On the one hand, most people always hoped that there
were fewer Beyonders in their own Sequences, and on the other
hand, the price of the corresponding ingredients would be raised
signiﬁcantly if there were many competitors who bid up the prices of
the ingredients. It was the same with the subsequent potions.
After some serious thought, Xio slowly became nervous again,
because it was normal for a recipe to be placed on sale for a long
time without being sold.
Moreover, the Arbiter pathway belonged to the royal family and the
military. All aspects were strictly controlled, and the leaked ones
came from a small number of destitute nobles. There were hardly any
complete formulas for the low to mid Sequences. Often, only one or
two of them were complete and compounded with the knowledge
that the main ingredients were controlled and diﬃcult to obtain.
Beyonders who chose this Sequence were rather rare.
Xio had been in some mysticism circles in Backlund for a long period
of time, but she hadn’t found an Arbiter apart from herself. On the
one hand, the others might have concealed it well, but on the other
hand, that might also explain the problems faced in this Sequence
pathway.
Phew, but compared to Fors, I’m lucky enough. She hasn’t encountered
any of the subsequent recipes for Apprentice all this time… Xio saw Mr.
A’s attendant approaching and wrote a note saying that she was
purchasing the Sheriﬀ’s recipe.
Before long, she was led to the study on the ﬁrst ﬂoor. Before
entering, she took a hooded robe from the attendant and covered
herself with it.
The seller in the study was dressed in the same way, so they couldn’t
see each other’s faces clearly.
“This is the formula to the Sheriﬀ potion. Where’s my money?” the
seller asked with a hoarse voice as he pressed a piece of paper on the
desk.
Xio pulled out the cash that she had long counted numerous times
and pushed it to the seller.
After checking the authenticity of the notes and the total sum, the
seller ﬁnally released the potion formula he held.
Xio immediately took one step forward and grabbed the note.
Her eyes swept straight to the main ingredients as they were of great
importance.
“A pair of Terror Demon Worm’s eyes. Silver War Bear’s right palm.”
Beyonder items I know of, but I’ve never seen them being sold… Xio
sighed and walked out of the study and took oﬀ her robe.
Back in the living room, she sat beside Fors. Having fulﬁlled her
wish, she slowly began to worry about the unknown honorary name
and the evil spirit that might be haunting her.
10, no, 20, no, 30 to request for someone skilled in exorcism to do a
puriﬁcation ritual for me. Xio made up her mind, and after exchanging
a few whispered words with Fors, she beckoned for Mr. A’s attendant.
After the end of the free communication break, she saw her request
appear as an additional entry on the blackboard.
“Suspected haunting of evil spirits. Requesting the help of friends
who specialize in exorcism. 30 pounds.”
After a while, Mr. A’s attendant came to the two of them and quietly
invited them to the living room on the ﬁrst ﬂoor.
There was a man wearing a white mask inside. He looked at the two
people who were wearing loose robes that concealed their genders
and chuckled.
“Let me introduce myself ﬁrst, so that you won’t doubt my ability.”
“No, no, we trust Mr. A,” Xio, with her hood over her face, said
before Fors could open her mouth.
She deliberately suppressed her voice to prevent her childish voice
from revealing her identity.
The man with the white mask spread his hands and laughed.
“This is my habit, I am a believer of the Sun. As you know, this is not
common in Backlund, or in the entire kingdom.
“It is only through moments like this that I can live as my true self.”
Due to the great conﬂict between the Church of the Eternal Blazing
Sun and the Church of the Lord of Storms, the former had never been
able to obtain the right to proselytize in the Loen Kingdom.
“A believer of the Sun?” Fors’s languid look instantly vanished. “This
is the ﬁrst time I’m seeing a living believer of the Sun! Eh… It’s not
like I can meet diplomats of higher standing.”
“Then, should I feel honored?” The man in the white mask spread his
arms wide and held them up in a gesture of praise for the Sun.
Instead of answering his question, Fors smiled and said, “In terms of
exorcism and puriﬁcation, the attendant of the Sun is a professional.
Our hearts are at rest, so we can begin.”
The man who claimed to be a believer of the Sun didn’t drone on. He
took out a badge with the symbol of the “Sun” on it and placed it on
the round table in the center. Then, he used a dualistic ritual method
to light up two candles.
After ﬁnishing the preparatory steps one step at a time, he chanted
with a loud and abnormally pious tone.
“The Sun that is Eternal,
“You are an Inextinguishable Light.
“You are the Embodiment of Order
“I pray to you,
“Please bestow me with your cleansing glow.
“Please repel the evils spirits in this body.”
…
Amid the echoing Hermes incantation, Xio and Fors saw bright light
burst out from the Sun’s emblem, bursting in a pure and warm
manner.
It was endless, like the tide, as the light surged towards the two of
them, engulﬁng them simultaneously.
Nearly a minute later, everything was restored to normal. All Xio and
Fors felt was warmth, ﬁnding the warmth very comfortable and
relieving. It was like soaking in a hot spring, or having gone
sunbathing.
…
Cherwood Borough. Rice Police Station.
Klein was sitting on a low bench with a group of thieves and
drunkards. It looked very disgraceful.
Suddenly, he felt warmth on the back of his hand as the coldness of
the Backlund night was dispelled quite signiﬁcantly.
Lowering his head, Klein realized that the four black dots
representing the mysterious space above the gray fog didn’t appear.
Who’s being so kind? To know that I was feeling a little cold just now…
he mumbled half jokingly and half-curious.
As a former inspector, he looked at the thief on the left who was
handcuﬀed to the pipe, then at the drunkard on the right who could
vomit at any moment but kept yelling about hitting people. He sighed
at his present predicament and wasn’t sure when he would be free
from this.
There should be another test after this and then I’ll be ﬁne once I pass it…
I hope the police will have their attention on the ambassador and the
Zmanger gang, and ignore my origins as a puny detective. In theory,
there’s a high chance for that. As long as Mrs. Sammer, Mr. Jurgen, and
the others don’t say anything of interest to the police… Yes, they have
only just met me so it’s impossible for them to know too much…
Meursault’s Beyonder characteristic was taken away by me and was
hidden above the gray fog. He didn’t leave behind anything strange, so no
one would able to discover that he used to be a Beyonder and have
questions about my strength… Hmm… More than an hour has passed…
In his self-encouragement, Klein saw the oﬃcer with the short
brownish-yellow beard walking towards him.
“Sherlock Moriarty, come with me to the interrogation room,” the
sergeant said without further explanation.
Here it comes… Klein stood up and followed.
After going around a corner, the sergeant stopped in front of an iron
door and gestured for Klein to enter.
Klein took a deep breath before exhaling. He yanked the handle and
opened the door.
It was a small room with thick walls and a small table in the middle.
There were chairs on both sides of the table.
Under the elegant gas lamp’s illumination, Klein identiﬁed the
interrogator as a man who wore a black shirt, a rather uncommon
sight.
He didn’t wear a vest but wore a black coat that wasn’t part of the
usual formal attire. He had thin eyebrows and cold blue eyes. His
face was cut, looking rigid while lacking any gentleness.
The man pointed the chair opposite him and said in a deep voice, “I
ask, you answer.”
Before he ﬁnished his sentence, Klein felt an unimaginable
suppressive force on him. He felt that an electric current was tearing
through his mind that lashed at his soul with a barbed whip.
This “feeling” was painful and numbing, as though it stemmed from
deep within the brain. It was barely resistible, and all he could do
was tremble and have his knees buckle.
Klein nearly fell to the ground as he hurriedly held onto the table and
sat down. His temples felt a throbbing pain.
This… this is the result of Beyonder powers… Ordinary people might’ve
thought of it as a psychological problem caused by nervousness and
the authority of the interrogator opposite them, but Klein had clearly
identiﬁed that this was a result of Beyonder powers, powers that
could directly attack the mind of others!
He quickly recalled the information he had seen before and quickly
conﬁrmed the target of his suspicion.
Arbiter pathway, Sequence 7: Interrogator!
Has the matter been transferred to a special department of the military?
Klein thought with some relief.
As long as it isn’t the Nighthawks, everything’s ﬁne.
“Identify the ambassador who met Meursault from these
photographs.” The cold and unyielding man in black spread out eight
black-and-white photos on the small table.
Klein felt as if the electric whip in his mind was being lifted high, and
the warning of extreme pain made it so he didn’t dare to lie.
Of course, there was no need for Klein to lie. After a moment of
identiﬁcation, he pushed a photo in the direction of the interrogator.
It was a middle-aged gentleman who wore ostentatious clothing and
looked rather charming.
The interrogator glanced at it, but didn’t make any response. He once
again asked, “Were your previous statements the truth?”
Klein felt like he was being forced into a dream. He kept his mind
clear and rational, and he didn’t yield to the “whip” in his mind as he
sincerely replied, “Nothing but the truth.”
The interrogator leaned forward with his hands on the small table
and said, “When was the last time you met Ian Wright?”
“Yesterday, yesterday morning,” Klein said with great diﬃculty, “I
tailed Meursault and found the body of Detective Zreal. As I didn’t
want to deal with the police, I took Ian to identify the body and told
him to call the police. Zreal’s body was located at the sewer entrance
at the bottom of Iron Carbon Street in East Borough.”
After a brief silence, the interrogator ﬁnally nodded his head. Klein
immediately felt the enormous pressure disappear along with the
“whip” in his mind.
“You may leave now,” he said without a trace of emotion in his
voice.
Klein stood up and opened the door, not masking the frailty in his
gait.
He found it more tiring than ﬁghting Meursault. If he made the
slightest mistake, his spirit would’ve been completely crushed, and he
would obediently answer any question that the other party asked.
No, if it wasn’t for the fact that my spirit is special and how it’s been
subjected to the test of raving and screaming for a long period of time,
allowing me to maintain my calm and rationality under certain
circumstances, I would’ve most likely had a mental breakdown just now…
Klein walked back down the corridor, his back feeling cold.
At this moment, the sergeant from before came over and said, “Come
with me to ﬁll out some forms. Lawyer Jurgen is waiting to bail you
out.”
Phew… Klein secretly exhaled and completely relaxed.
He knew that the danger was over.
Chapter 231: Losses
Klein met Jurgen Cooper in an oﬃce at the Rice Police Station. This
young senior solicitor was still dressed formally as though he was
always ready to go to a posh dinner party.
He wore a black double-breasted attire, a white shirt with a stiﬀ
collar, a huge bow tie, and bright leather boots, which made the
policemen act very polite to him.
Jurgen held his half top hat and looked at Klein with his blue eyes
while saying, “The formalities are over. You can leave if you pay the
bail of ten pounds.”
“Thank you.” Klein didn’t say anything more, but followed the good-
looking but seemingly old-fashioned Jurgen to the police station’s
ﬁnancial aﬀairs oﬃce that was nearby, where he ﬁshed out his wallet
and pulled out two ﬁve-pound notes.
He was grateful that he had all his cash—95 pounds—on him, or else
he might’ve had to borrow it from his good neighbor, Jurgen.
Of course, the worst-case scenario would be if he had left the money
at home. Klein wasn’t certain how much of that would be left after
the police searched the scene. Yet, he couldn’t put it in the world
above the gray fog, because it was possible that he needed to oﬀer
bribes to free himself.
At present, many newspapers and magazines were discrediting the
police as being unsupervised, violent, corrupt, extortionary, and
vicious. Klein didn’t dare to believe it fully, but neither did he dare to
doubt it. After all, Meursault’s money could very well end up in the
pockets of someone in the police station.
After paying the bail, Klein followed Jurgen out of the police station
and shivered when hit by the humid, cold wind.
“After the case is closed, your bail will be returned to you. Of course,
you can’t expect them to voluntarily notify you. Yes… In a week, if
no one notiﬁes you that your presence is required back at the station,
you can come here and ask for your bail to be returned. In theory,
you could still get appropriate compensation, if any, from the other
party’s estate.” Jurgen walked over to a carriage parked nearby.
The rain that had poured down during the entire day had ﬁnally
come to a stop, but the crimson moon remained hidden by the dark
clouds. The only light that could be seen on the street was from the
gas lamps.
“Alright.” Klein almost believed that he would have to part with the
ten pounds forever.
He couldn’t help but calculate how much it cost him to take up Ian’s
job. He had been paid ﬁve pounds, but many pieces of furniture and
tea sets were destroyed at his home. He either had to buy new ones
or get someone to repair them for him. With the materials used, the
cost of the carriage, and the cost of mending his clothes, the math
seemed to imply that he would be losing money…
If I don’t manage to get back the ten pounds worth of bail money, this
would be a great loss! Well… the Beyonder characteristic left behind by
Meursault is actually worth quite a bit of money… Klein got into the
carriage and frowned slightly.
He had always thought that the private detectives who used their
own residences as oﬃces would, at most, not be entrusted with
anything and wouldn’t suﬀer any losses, but in the end…
Klein turned his head to look at Jurgen, who was sitting up straight,
and he said with sincerity, “Thank you. Thank you for coming to bail
me out. How much should I pay you?”
Jurgen nodded very formally and said, “This one’s pro bono.
“I heard from Sergeant Faxine that you were involved in an incident.
I believe that we’ll have many opportunities to work together in the
future.”
There will be many opportunities to work together in the future… Klein
couldn’t help but laugh as he said, “Lawyer Jurgen, are you cursing
me?”
Jurgen shook his head solemnly and said, “No, it’s not what you
think. It’s very common for a private detective to have a ﬁxed lawyer
he works with.”
Sir, you sure lack a sense of humor… even though you look rather
young… Klein lampooned before saying with a smile, “Coincidentally,
I’m in need of a lawyer to help me draw up an investment contract.”
“Investment contract?” Jurgen asked in a slightly stunned tone.
“I know that this isn’t part of the work of a private detective, but I
happened to chance upon a good investment opportunity,” Klein
explained simply. “Lawyer Jurgen, how much would a contract cost
according to your usual fees?”
“Generally, it’s based on the total amount of the contract and the
level of ease,” Jurgen answered seriously.
“The total amount is one hundred pounds, the terms needed are…”
Klein described his needs in detail, including a preemptive right, veto
rights, and so on.
Jurgen thought hard for a few minutes before saying, “Two pounds.
I’ll give it to you Monday morning.”
“Alright,” Klein said no more regarding the matter. Instead, he began
asking Jurgen information about the case that night.
On the way back to Minsk Street, Klein took the initiative to pay the
carriage’s fare of 3 soli. After bidding farewell to the young but
serious lawyer, he walked back to his house.
He opened the door and when he saw the messy scene, his heart
winced.
He never expected that he would start his detective business with a
loss.
Just as Klein took oﬀ his coat and began working on cleaning up the
mess, the doorbell rang.
He opened the door in puzzlement and saw Julianne, the maid from
next door in a black-and-white skirt.
“Good evening, Mr. Moriarty. Mr. and Mrs. Sammer wish to invite
you over to discuss something,” Julianne said with a tone that had
traces of fear.
Here it comes… the problem regarding compensation… Klein revealed a
smile and said, “Alright.”
He changed into a clean coat and followed the maidservant next
door. Luke Sammer and his wife, Stelyn Sammer were sitting on a
sofa in the living room.
The stout Luke, with a pencil-thin mustache, stood up and extended
his hand as he said with a chuckle, “Good evening, Mr. Moriarty. I
only just learned that you were a private detective. That’s quite
unbecoming as a neighbor.”
“No, it was my fault. I didn’t know if I was suited for this career and
might ﬁnd other jobs at any moment,” Klein said as he shook the
hand of the male master. “I’m very sorry for what happened tonight.
I’ll compensate you.”
“It’s just an accident,” Luke said reassuringly.
The blonde, blue-eyed, and pretty Stelyn asked out of curiosity, “Did
you really kill the intruder? Heh, you must want black tea, right?”
Klein nodded.
“Perhaps he was just a thief.”
He didn’t mention that the problem stemmed due to one of his jobs,
in order to prevent the Sammer couple from having any unpleasant
feelings.
Since the police didn’t inform them, there’s no need for me to do anything
unnecessary… Klein silently added.
Luke Sammer laughed and said, “You must possess excellent combat
skills. As a neighbor, I feel very safe. Perhaps we will have matters to
entrust you in the future.”
Klein seemingly gave a self-deprecating laugh.
“Actually, I was almost killed.”
“Regardless, you were the ultimate victor,” Luke said.
After chatting about this topic for a while, Stelyn picked up a
porcelain teacup and took a sip.
“I’m very curious about how many commissions a private detective
receives a week, and how much can they earn?”
Klein didn’t try to hide anything as he laughed.
“It depends on the situation. Just like when there are good and bad
harvests in the farms. I earned ﬁve pounds and ﬁve soli last week.
But after last night’s incident, I might have made a loss.”
As if she didn’t hear the latter half of his words, she continued, “If
you can maintain this income, you’ll get a pretty good life in
Backlund’s Cherwood district at 5 pounds a week. There’s no need to
sublet another room, and you can hire a maid to do odd jobs, listen
to a symphony every other week, or go to the theatrical opera once.
Once a week, you can play tennis or squash, join a reading salon, and
go to a nice restaurant. Of course, if you’re already preparing for
marriage, you need to save a little money. A weekly salary of ﬁve
pounds is still a little short of being truly decent.”
“Then, what is the required weekly salary to be truly decent?” Klein
asked.
“Seven pounds, at least.” Stelyn lifted her chin slightly.
Klein turned to Luke and said casually, “I heard from your wife that
you work at Coim, but I’m not sure what its main business is.”
“Anthracite and charcoal,” Luke answered with a smile.
It’s no wonder you became a member of the Soot Reduction Association…
Klein pondered for a moment and said, “In Backlund, how big of a
salary does a manager receive? It’s seldom mentioned in the
newspapers and magazines.”
“Haha, it depends on the industry, as well as the actual position’s job
scope. Backlund Bank’s best manager earns 5000 pounds a year, but
for me, it’s about 430 to 440 pounds including bonuses,” Luke said
casually.
That’s about eight pounds a week… No wonder… Before Klein could
open his mouth, Stelyn Samuel grumbled, “Actually, we could’ve
lived in the suburbs, and I’ll have a garden and a lawn. Luke would
then be able to have a stable and buy a new carriage and the two
foals he’s been eyeing all this time, but he would waste too much
time on his commute to work. That would be even more valuable.”
A new carriage including horses costs about a hundred pounds… Eight
pounds a week is indeed impressive; unfortunately, it hasn’t been long
since I had a pay rise when… Klein could only smile in response.
After exchanging a few more pleasantries, he bade farewell and left,
sighing to himself in his heart.
Mr. and Mrs. Sammer are still considered nice. If I had a mean landlord,
I’d have had my deposit deducted and refunded and be asked to get lost
after what happened tonight…
After returning home, Klein began laboring. He wasn’t in a hurry to
go above the gray fog to examine the warm current on the back of his
hand, nor was he in a hurry to do divination because he was afraid
that the military’s special department was still keeping tabs on him.
He decided to go to the bar which Ian had described tomorrow night
to buy a gun so as to deal with people who might assault him
recklessly in desperation.
Klein even planned to ﬁnd the means to hire a bodyguard, a powerful
Beyonder bodyguard. This was so that ﬁrst, he could take advantage
of the opportunity to contact Beyonder circles without exposing
himself, and second, it was because he was also afraid that the
ambassador’s next assailant would have the ability to hide from the
military’s special department.
Although it was a slightly comical thing for a Sequence 8 Beyonder—
a vengeful evil spirit in hiding—to need a bodyguard, as safety was of
paramount importance to Klein.
If the price is too high, I’ll blow the copper whistle for Mr. Azik, which, of
course, might be more dangerous… I don’t know much about Sealed
Artifact 0-08… After cleaning up the house, Klein silently muttered.
…
After the puriﬁcation ceremony ended, the man in the white mask
said to Xio and Fors,”No matter what kind of sinister spirit it is, it has
already been exorcised by me. Heh, if it has reached the level of an
evil spirit that I’m unable to exorcise, it should’ve given a response.
However, there was none.”
As he spoke, he poured the water which had condensed on the
emblem of the Sun into a small metal bottle and handed it to Xio.
“Sprinkle it in your room to ward oﬀ any remnants.”
“Thank you.” Xio paid him while feeling the pinch, but she felt a lot
more relaxed.
Moments after she returned to the living room with Fors, the
attendant delivered a note to them.
“Miss Arbiter, who has just bought the Sheriﬀ formula, would you
mind having a chat in the study? I might have what you need.”
Chapter 232: The Bravehearts
Bar
Who? How did that person know that I purchased the Sheriﬀ recipe? Xio’s
dark green pupils contracted as she surveyed her surroundings in
astonishment, but she didn’t see anyone suspiciously watching her.
According to Mr. A, the transactions here should be very safe and
conﬁdential here…Finally, Xio couldn’t help but look at the single sofa
where Mr. A, whose face was covered by a hood, sat. He was still
quietly sizing people up without revealing anything odd.
She nudged Fors with her elbow and whispered, “Should I go?”
Fors took the piece of paper, glanced at it, and replied without
hesitation, “Go, at least you still have Mr. A watching. No one would
dare to do anything to you, so you can take the opportunity to ﬁnd
out what the other party’s goal is. Who knows? You might actually
obtain the potion materials you want as a result?”
“That makes sense…” Xio, who was a very proactive person,
immediately nodded to the attendant, followed him to the study, and
ﬁnally, put on a hooded robe.
This hood can cover my entire face, so much so that I can’t see the path in
front of me… Having worn the hood, Xio opened the door and saw a
man dressed in a tuxedo sitting behind a desk.
The man wore a golden mask that revealed his eyes, nostrils, mouth,
and cheeks, but it was impossible to identify him.
The light brown eyes behind the golden mask shifted as the man
pointed to the chair opposite the desk and said, “Have a seat.”
His voice was deliberately hoarse; otherwise, there was nothing
special about it.
Xio closed the door to the study, stuck her chest out and raised her
head, and sat down in the designated position without feeling
intimidated. She then asked, “Do you have the main ingredients for
the Sheriﬀ potion?”
The masked man chuckled and said, “Yes, I have the eyes of a Terror
Demon Worm and the right palm of a Silver War Bear.
“In fact, that Sheriﬀ potion formula you bought was sold on my
behalf…”
No wonder… Xio was often mocked as a brainless person by her good
friends, but to survive in the circle of Beyonders, in the gangs of the
East Borough, and among the poor, she wasn’t a completely reckless
person. She had the intuition for danger that was akin to a wild
beast.
She asked in a deep voice, “Why are you doing this?”
“To select suitable helpers.” The masked man chuckled. “With your
ﬁnancial situation, it’ll be diﬃcult for you to gather the money
needed for these two Beyonder ingredients in a short period of time.
Of course, you can sell the formula at other Beyonder gatherings, but
please, believe me, this will bring you unnecessary danger. Our
circles might not overlap, but I’m not the only person.”
Xio frowned and said, “Since you have such a massive organization
and possess the formulas to the Sheriﬀ and Arbiter potions, why do
you need my help?”
“There are certain matters we do not wish to deal with ourselves.
There are many reasons, but there’s no need for me to tell you that.
And every Arbiter that embarks on the journey as a Beyonder by
themselves has, more or less, some connection with the aristocracy.
This is something we need,” the masked man explained, simply.
It seems like he doesn’t know about my origins, nor is he aware of my
reputation in the East Borough… Xio relaxed a little.
The masked man continued, “Just treat it as additional missions
beyond the Beyonder gatherings. I will give you some missions and
pay you with the corresponding rewards. If you feel that it’s
dangerous, you can reject them. This is a fair and free trade. Once
you save up enough money, you can purchase the ingredients from
me.”
This… Xio, who was still struggling with her ﬁnancial situation,
suddenly had her heart stir. She continued acting reserved for nine
seconds before she said, “As long as I have the right to reject
missions, I can consider it.”
“No problem.” The masked man laughed. “We can agree on where
and how we’ll meet in the future. To make you feel at ease, we’ll
concede the right to decide the details to you.”
“Alright.” Although Xio was still baﬄed and didn’t understand why
the other party was oﬀering her missions to perform, she still agreed.
At the very least, she couldn’t identify any obvious dangers at the
moment.
…
Klein busied himself with buying chairs and tea sets and mending his
clothes the whole of Sunday. He spent a total of 6 pounds 9 soli to
restore the living room, the dining room, and himself to their original
states.
What a loss. I hope that the police department compensates me for my
losses from Meursault’s estate. Sigh, the chances are slim since it’s, at best,
just a portion. Klein placed the invoices and receipts neatly in place,
waiting for them to be used in the future.
Of course, in terms of income alone, he had made quite a killing.
Meursault’s Beyonder characteristic was worth at least 300 pounds,
or more.
The premise of all of this was that Klein had access to a circle of
Beyonders.
After dinner, dressed in a turtleneck sweater, a solid-colored sweater,
a grayish-blue worker’s coat, and a cap, Klein went out, once again,
and made two transfers before arriving at Iron Gate Street in the area
of the Backlund Bridge.
He saw Bravehearts Bar after taking a few steps. He saw a seemingly
heavy black wooden door and a nearly two-meter-tall brawny man
with his arms folded.
The brawny man sized up Klein, but he didn’t stop him from pushing
open the door, but his throat moved when he heard the cheers inside.
This was when the bar was experiencing its peak business. Before
Klein even entered, he felt a heat wave engulf him. He could smell
the strong aroma of malt beer and hear a din.
Unsurprisingly, he saw two stages in the middle of the bar. One of
them was having a rat-baiting with dogs competition, and the other
stage had two boxers patiently waiting for the ﬁght to begin.
The aroma of alcohol mixed with the smell of sweat emanated. Klein
lifted his gold-rimmed glasses and pinched his nose. While protecting
his belongings, he squeezed his way to the bar counter.
Before the bartender could say anything, he said, “One glass of
Southville beer.”
This was the best beer that the Loen Kingdom produced.
“Five pence,” the bartender replied like clockwork.
Klein took out a handful of coins and counted out ﬁve pence before
handing them over in exchange for a large wooden cup of golden
beer. The aroma of the beer was alluring.
“In front of it, many beers can’t even be called alcohol and can only
be considered as beverages.” The bartender chuckled.
Klein lifted up the cup and took a swig. It was cool and refreshing,
ﬁrst bitter and fragrant, but later, the ﬂavor of malt burst out. It had
a slightly sweet aftertaste.
After putting down the cup, he looked at the tiny white bubbles and
took the opportunity to ask, “Where’s Kaspars Kalinin?”
The bartender stopped wiping the glass in his hand as he looked up
and observed Klein for a few seconds before pointing to the side.
“Billiard room 3.”
In the spirit of not wasting anything, Klein carried the cup and
walked to the third billiard room.
With just a light tap, he allowed the door to creak open.
The two men inside stopped and looked towards the door.
“I’m looking for Kaspars Kalinin.” Amidst the silence, Klein hurriedly
added, “Old Geezer introduced me.”
Upon hearing this, a ﬁfty-year-old man with a big nose and a linen
shirt said in a deep voice, “Come in.”
He had a huge, twisted scar running from the corner of his right eye
to the side of his mouth, and his nose was a typical brandy nose, one
that almost completely red.
Klein slowly walked in with the cup in his hand and saw that
Kaspars’s billiard opponent had put aside his cue stick like clockwork
and left the room before closing the door behind him.
Kaspars Kalinin hobbled over and asked, “What do you want?”
“A powerful custom revolver and ﬁfty rounds.” Klein took another sip
of his Southville beer.
“3 pounds 10 soli.” Kaspars gave the price. “This will deﬁnitely be
more expensive than a regular weapons store. The price includes the
risks I have to undertake.”
“Deal.” Klein took ﬁve one-pound notes he prepared from his trouser
pocket and counted them.
Kaspars checked for the notes’ authenticity before nodding.
“You’re more straightforward than you look. Give me ﬁve minutes.”
He put the notes on the billiard table, leaned against a crutch, and
limped to the door.
After watching Kaspars leave, Klein glanced back at the currently
trendy billiards and found it to be very similar to snooker on Earth.
It must be you, Emperor Roselle… He nearly lost his composure and
laughed while shaking his head.
After a short wait, Kaspars pushed the door open and entered,
carrying a package wrapped in brown paper and two ﬁve-soli notes.
Klein took the money and the item and opened it on the spot. His
eyes caught the long, silvery barrel of a revolver. The grip seemed to
be made of walnut wood.
In addition to that, there were ﬁfty glistening rounds neatly placed in
the box.
Klein tried the empty gun, loaded ﬁve rounds, stuﬀed the revolver
into his armpit holster he bought some time back. Then, he gathered
up the remaining bullets and looked up at Kaspars. He deliberated
and asked, “If I wish to hire a good bodyguard, who should I look
for?
“A very good one, the kind that exceeds human limitations.”
Kaspars rubbed his red nose and his eyes turned cold.
He carefully examined Klein for two minutes, using his silence to
create a terrible sense of oppression.
“I can make the query for you, but there’s no guarantee that someone
will accept this mission.”
He seems to know more than one Beyonder… Klein smiled and said, “No
matter what the result is, please allow me to express my gratitude in
advance.”
Kaspars put away the bills on the billiard table and walked out again.
It was a full ten minutes before he returned to his room. And by then,
Klein had already ﬁnished his huge cup of Southville beer out of
boredom.
“He wants to meet you before making a decision,” Kaspars said in a
deep voice.
“No problem. I would also determine the diﬃculty of the mission if it
were me.” Klein smiled and nodded.
He followed behind Kaspars who hobbled past the crowded boxing
ring and into the kitchen of the bar.
Kaspars suddenly stopped and lightly knocked on a door. After
gaining permission, he pushed it open and entered with Klein in tow.
It was a card room where more than ten people were playing Texas
poker.
A man wearing a black vest and a white shirt slowly stood up after
seeing Kaspars and Klein enter the room. The others who were
playing cards stopped in their tracks and didn’t make a sound.
With a single glance, Klein frowned indiscernibly.
Apart from the man that had stood up, he noticed that all the other
players had an indescribable sense of strangeness to them. Their faces
were pale, and their eyes were like those of wild beasts.
Tapping his left molar twice, Klein secretly activated his Spirit Vision.
His muscles tensed up abruptly, and he almost couldn’t control his
expression because the auras of those players were dark black!
That meant that, apart from the man who stood up, the ten plus
people playing cards were all dead!
No, they weren’t just dead, as the dead had no aura colors
These were all zombies!
The feeling of rotting came over him, and the man in the white shirt
and black vest walked in front of Klein.
His face was equally pale, and there seemed to be deep malice in his
eyes.
Chapter 233: A Man Cannot Be
Judged By His Looks
The more he thought about how a living person was playing cards
with more than ten corpses in a dimly lit room into the night, the
more his scalp tingled.
Klein suppressed his instinctive fear and looked at the pale face, the
malicious brown eyes, and the man who was about twenty-eight
years old that suﬀused madness. He pretended to be intimidated by
the man’s dominance and took a step back. During this time, Kaspars
left the room and closed the door.
The man asked in a deep voice, “You’re the one looking for a
bodyguard?”
“… Yes.” Klein gulped deliberately.
The man’s strangeness made him feel fear, but it also brought him
peace of mind.
The stronger the bodyguard, the safer he would be!
The pale-faced man in the black vest lifted his chin and asked, “Why
are you looking for a bodyguard? How much are you willing to pay
for this?”
Klein didn’t answer straight away. He thought for nearly twenty
seconds before saying, “I’ll tell you the details of the mission ﬁrst.
Give me a price after you assess it. If I can pay for it, or if I have an
item of equivalent value, we would have ourselves a deal. Otherwise,
I can only give up and look for someone else.”
The ﬁerce-looking man didn’t say a word. Instead, he nodded as a
gesture for Klein to recount his story.
Klein deliberately looked at the zombies, treating them as normal
card players. Then, he gave the man an inquisitive look saying:
“Before I answer, do you want to kick these guys out of the room?”
“There’s no need for that,” the pale-faced man said in a deep voice.
Klein hesitated for a moment, then honestly said, “I oﬀended a big
shot who might have a country supporting him.”
The room suddenly turned still and silent. The man, who had a hint
of madness and malice in his eyes, froze on the spot as if he had
turned into a plaster statue.
After nearly a minute, he slowly said, “This mission is priceless.
“Get out.”
Ah? Klein didn’t manage to react until the man turned and walked
back to the card table. Only then did he realize that there was no
deal.
You played cards with a bunch of living corpses in the room and presented
yourself as a person of high standing and strength. Yet, you were scared
oﬀ just like that? You’re clearly a little crazy… Klein didn’t know
whether to laugh or cry as he added, “The big shot doesn’t have that
much freedom in Backlund.”
The man in the black vest ignored him and sat down again. The
zombies began to hand out cards, look at their cards, and throw out
chips.
Klein exhaled and backed out of the room only to see Kaspars
Kalinin. He had been waiting outside with his brandy nose and
hideous wound.
“We didn’t come to an arrangement.” Klein threw up his hands.
Kaspars didn’t show a look of surprise as he pondered for a few
seconds before saying, “Did he request too high a price?”
“No, he ﬁnds the mission too diﬃcult.” Klein didn’t hide the reason.
Kaspars frowned.
“Maric is the scariest person I know. He isn’t even afraid of bullets,
and since he thinks the mission is diﬃcult, I don’t think I can help
you get in touch with other powerful people.”
“What a pity.” Klein sighed.
Kaspars clenched his right ﬁst and struck his left chest.
“May the Storm be with you.”
Then I’m dead… Klein said with a smile as he made the best out of it,
“Thank you.
“You can try asking around for me. I’ll pay you a fee. Yeah… I’ll
come again tomorrow night. ”
After receiving a positive answer, he left the Bravehearts Bar feeling
slightly melancholic. He didn’t even have the interest to play a game
of billiards.
Was I being too honest? If I described the mission in a way that sounded
simpler, Maric would’ve agreed… I just wonder how much money he
would ask for… Sigh, it’s not my style to let someone else face the danger
for me through deceit… As a Beyonder, if I constantly go against my
heart’s true thoughts and my own principles, then I probably won’t be far
from losing control… Feeling mixed emotions, Klein changed carriages
and returned to Minsk Street.
…
After washing up, Klein didn’t waste any charcoal. He directly went
to the bedroom and pulled the curtain to isolate the room from the
outside world.
On the way back, he carefully thought for a while and discovered
that the possible danger wasn’t something that couldn’t be resolved.
To the unknown ambassador, his primary and fundamental purpose is to
ﬁnd Ian Wright. The reason he sent people to deal with me was because he
wished to obtain clues to ﬁnding Ian from me. If direct interrogation
doesn’t work, killing me and channeling my spirit could be considered… If
I let him know that I can’t ﬁnd Ian either, he wouldn’t take the risk to
deal with a hired detective when the military’s special department might be
monitoring the situation.
Of course, my appearance and strength far exceeded his expectations,
causing their operation to be exposed and causing them to suﬀer heavy
setbacks. If I were the ambassador, I would deﬁnitely think about revenge
and vent my anger, but it deﬁnitely wouldn’t be now, not when the
situation is so tense and turbulent… Yes, this is building on the premise
that the ambassador has brains, and he isn’t a good-for-nothing who got
to his position through connections and only knows to act rashly… For
him to be handling such an important matter, it must mean that he’s still
rather reliable…
In other words, the crux of the problem is Ian Wright’s whereabouts!
Hmm… There’s still some latent danger. Would the ambassador reveal to
the military’s special department that Meursault is a Beyonder after his
failure? That would make them ﬁnd my strength questionable, and use
them to retaliate against me… This can be done easily with an oﬀhand
remark with no diﬃculty involved. I have to be on my guard…
Klein analyzed his situation and suddenly had the urge to kill the
unknown ambassador.
However, just the thought of powerful Beyonders around him left
him depressed.
I wonder if the messenger can accept my delegations without Mr. Azik’s
permission… Probably not… Should I pay close attention to this matter
and ﬁnd an opportunity to silence him? Since he sent someone to kill me, I
wouldn’t feel any psychological burden from killing him… Yes, I can
consider setting a mission for the Tarot Club. Let’s see if Miss Justice and
Mr. Hanged Man have any solutions… Perhaps, a large sum of money
can tempt that “Mr. A” or some other powerful Beyonders… Klein
suddenly had an idea came to him as he thought of the Tarot Club.
With this idea in mind, he calmed down a lot. He found some paper
and a pen and wrote the divination statement: “Ian Wright’s
whereabouts.”
After conﬁrming that there were no hidden Beyonders in the room,
Klein looked at the curtain that shielded him from prying eyes. He
recalled Ian’s appearance and silently read out the divination
sentence before leaning back into his chair.
He quickly entered a dream and saw a dark, small, run-down room in
the dreamy world. There was a bunk bed and a ﬂoor mat that four
people slept on.
Ian was curled up at the top of the bunk bed, sleeping soundly under
an old satchel.
When the dream shattered, Klein opened his eyes and interpreted the
revelation.
Living quarters like that only exist in the East Borough and the Backlund
Bridge area, but it’s an abnormally huge place. Even if all the police in
Backlund are deployed, they still wouldn’t be able to ﬁnd it…
Ian was very careful. He didn’t leave anything with me. Otherwise, I
would’ve been able to ﬁnd him through dowsing rod divination…
After a few minutes of consideration, Klein picked up the pen and
added a paragraph to each of the divination statements, making it an
excuse:
“I don’t know Ian Wright’s whereabouts. I haven’t seen him since we
found Zreal’s body.”
That piece of paper was left on the desk with a pen pressed against its
edge.
After all was done, Klein got up and went back to his bed, making a
quick, less obvious ﬂick of the coin to make sure that no one was
watching him.
After obtaining a negative answer, he quickly took four steps
counterclockwise, chanted the incantation, and entered the world
above the gray fog.
Within the ancient and towering palace, Klein couldn’t be bothered to
inspect the situation around him, and instead repeated the divination
he had just done.
Seeing that the negative answer hadn’t changed, he stopped feeling
so nervous. Raising his head to the side, he realized that the core
position of the newly added crimson star had been dyed with a sun-
like gold.
“Is this the source of the warmth I felt?” Klein spread out his
spirituality and gingerly touched it in response to the prayer.
A blurry scene quickly appeared in front of his eyes.
The petite lady he had tried to pull up above the gray fog was
standing in front of an altar with a lady with slightly curled brown
hair. A man wearing a white mask softly chanted the honorary name
of the Eternal Blazing Sun, creating a warm and pure light.
Was she trying to get someone to do an exorcism? Klein almost laughed.
At that moment, he ﬁnally understood the reason behind the previous
situation. It wasn’t that someone had penetrated the gray fog and
locked onto him. It was similar to Justice and company reciting his
honorary name before making a prayer. And after the gray fog
received the message, it automatically give him feedback. However,
since it wasn’t a prayer, the illusory, overlapping voices ended up
becoming a warm current.
Notiﬁcation. This is a notiﬁcation, and not something that can cause harm
or inﬂuence… Klein made a deﬁnite judgment.
At the same time, he was roughly certain of one thing. The way the
mysterious space above the gray fog connected with Justice and the
others wasn’t absolutely abnormal or above the rules of this world. It
still suﬀered particular restrictions that could cause eﬀects of varying
degrees by using speciﬁc methods.
Klein continued watching the scene before him and listened to the
voice speaking. He was surprised to ﬁnd that it lasted longer than
ever before.
Before this, he wouldn’t be able to take the initiative to spy on the
corresponding target of the crimson stars, unless the other party had
prayed for it, and only then would he be able to receive the
corresponding scene.
In another situation, when he gave his feedback, he would be able to
see the scene and hear synchronized voices at the same time.
However, once the response ended, he would no longer be able to
gain any additional information.
Now, it was like watching a long video whose footage was ﬁlled with
mosaicked reality TV footage.
He saw the petite lady talking to a man in a golden mask in the
study, heard her companions address her as Xio, and realized that she
was looking for the Beyonder potion corresponding to the Sheriﬀ’s
potion.
It wasn’t until the two women returned home that Klein felt regretful
that he failed to identify their address. The “recording” thus came to
an end.
Watching the gradually dissipating gold colors, he nodded his head
thoughtfully. He vaguely understood why such an anomaly had
appeared.
In other words, the power of puriﬁcation helped me maintain the
corresponding passageway? Xio’s thirty pounds was worth it… I wonder
when I’ll be able to maintain it myself… Klein shook his head and
smiled. He took out a pen and a paper to continue to divine Ian
Wright’s whereabouts.
Chapter 234: The Night of the
Full Moon.
It was the same dream divination, but this time Klein saw more.
The ﬁrst scene was still the small, dark, squalid room with Ian Wright
sleeping soundly on a bunk bed.
The second scene was the same sewer they had both gone to. Ian
squatted in front of Zreal’s mutilated body, reached out with his hand
to rub the two rows of white teeth, and removed one of them.
The third scene was a busy and noisy street. The passersby were all
dressed in plain clothes, some of which that could be described as old
and tattered.
In the middle of the street, there were gardens and lawns, surrounded
by low chimneys that were puﬃng out smoke. Ian, in his old
overcoat and round hat, warily watched as he entered the telegraph
oﬃce not far from the center of the street. Diagonally across it was
the mall entrance to the steam metro.
The image quickly turned transparent. Klein opened his eyes, tapped
his index ﬁnger on the edge of the long bronze table and made a
preliminary judgment.
From that tooth and the telegram, it seems that Zreal and Ian aren’t just a
detective duo that found themselves involved in a dangerous situation.
They have an organization behind them!
I should be able to determine where the third scene is…
Klein was in no hurry to deeply analyze it, as he didn’t want to stay
too long above the fog.
Leaving the high back chair belonging to The Fool, he went to a
corner, rummaged through the paper bag that he had been placed
there previously, and found Meursault’s Beyonder characteristic.
Holding the crimson, jelly-like object, Klein sat down again and
wrote a new divination statement: “The corresponding potion name.”
As he silently recited the statement, he held onto the Beyonder
characteristic with one hand and the piece of paper with the
divination statement in the other. With the help of Cogitation, he fell
into a deep sleep.
In the gray, dreamy dream, the ambassador who was dressed to the
nines, appeared again before Klein with his thin, stubbly face.
Holding a bottle of crimson liquid, he said to Meursault, “Drink it,
drink this Hunter potion, and you’ll rule the Zmanger gang. Of
course, money is also indispensable, as Emperor Roselle once said—a
stick in one hand and a carrot in the other.”
“Hunter? Backlund is a huge metropolitan city…” Meursault frowned
and asked curiously.
To someone illiterate like him, hunters were associated with the
wilderness and animals.
The middle-aged ambassador chuckled and said, “The biggest city is
the largest dark forest.
“Here, everyone has two identities. One, the prey, and the other, the
hunter.
“Even the weakest hunter is a hunter. It’s possible for them to harm
stronger prey.
“Go, join this magniﬁcent hunt.”
…
The scene shattered and turned into countless specks of light. Klein
looked down at the crimson Beyonder characteristic in his hand and
said to himself silently, So it’s the Hunter potion. It’s no wonder
Meursault was so good at ﬁghting. He even used a blowpipe to shoot
poison darts.
It’s no wonder how he was able to track me here…
However, he doesn’t seem to fully understand the essence of being a
Hunter. He didn’t set any traps ahead of time or use any weapons. He
didn’t put his advantages to use… This is partly because he didn’t know
that I’m also a Beyonder, one that happens to be a Sequence 8. He
underestimated me. It’s also evident that he only recently consumed the
potion…
The Hunter pathway is both wielded by the former Intis royal family, the
Sauron family, and the Feysac Empire’s rulers, the Einhorn family, as well
as the secret organization, the Iron and Blood Cross Order, which
appeared in the past two to three centuries. Taking into account his attire,
that ambassador’s identity can essentially be conﬁrmed… a high-ranking
diplomat of the Intis Republic, an ambassador of the Loen Kingdom…
I wonder what that important item he’s trying to get his hands on is…
As his mind churned, Klein wrapped himself in his spirituality and
began the rapid descent.
As soon as he returned to his room, he immediately checked his
surroundings vigilantly, but he didn’t notice any unusual changes.
Phew. Klein let out a silent breath. He felt a bit more conﬁdent that
he would be able to convene the members of the Tarot Club on time
tomorrow afternoon.
He rummaged through the map of Backlund that he had bought on
the steam locomotive, looking for a telegraph oﬃce that was along
the subway line, one that wasn’t far from the middle of the street.
There were only a few subway lines in Backlund, so Klein quickly
identiﬁed three targets: one in West Borough, one in St. George
Borough, and one at the junction of East Borough and the Backlund
Bridge.
He recalled how most of the pedestrians in his dream were dressed to
determined their socioeconomic statuses and arrived at the ﬁnal
answer.
The third spot!
The place where the East Borough intersected with the Backlund Bridge!
Sometimes, interpreting a revelation requires a plethora of practical
knowledge and the ability to infer… Klein mocked himself, walked to
the desk, and added another sentence after the previous statement,
adding more to the contents written on the piece of paper.
I don’t know where Ian is. I haven’t seen him since we discovered Zreal’s
corpse. However, I learned through my own channels that Ian Wright had
appeared at the telegraph oﬃce on Bacardi Street.
After he ﬁnished writing, Klein didn’t fold the piece of paper and put
it away. Nor did he burn it with his spirituality. Instead, he allowed it
to remain spread out on the desk, freely revealing its contents.
After giving it a deep look, Klein went back to the bed and took oﬀ
his clothes to sleep.
Outside the tightly closed curtains, the crimson moon peeked out
from the layers of clouds, shining brightly and perfectly.
…
In a house at Hillston Borough.
Fors, who didn’t sleep with Xio, sat up suddenly and put her hands to
her head.
Her relatively pretty face was extremely twisted as if she was a devil.
Fors pressed against her ears and constantly tossed about in bed, as
though she was resisting the illusory muttering.
Sweat trickled down her forehead, and veins bulged on the back of
her hands.
Her body randomly tensed up or rolled. Her originally teasing and
languid pale blue eyes were ﬁlled with pain.
In the depths of those pupils, countless layers of light and shadows
seemed to appear.
“No!” Fors ﬁnally couldn’t hold it in anymore as she let out a low
tragic cry.
Her hands stopped covering her ears and resorted to yanking at her
hair, as though she was going to ﬁght pain with pain.
After a few minutes of writhing, she ﬁnally stopped.
She released her hands, looked at the handful of slightly curled
brown hair, and weakly laughed at herself.
“I lied to Xio, telling her that the murmurs every full moon don’t
have much of a negative eﬀect on me… At least losing hair is a
serious concern…”
With diﬃculty, Fors sat up and looked at the curtain that half
covered the window. Through it, she could see the dreamy crimson
moon outside.
“It’s getting worse each and every time. Will I lose control the next
time because of this…” Fors could no longer suppress the weakness
that she had buried deep in her heart.
She had attempted to separate herself from the bracelet that allowed
people to teleport through the spiritual world, but it no longer
resulted in the disappearance of the murmurs during a full moon.
She had tried to take sedatives, had tried chanting the name of the
God of Steam and Machinery, had tried some ritualistic magic, but it
hadn’t changed the fact that she was gradually slipping into the
abyss.
“If only I could understand what the murmurs are saying… I wish to
die in the know, and not be buried clueless… P-perhaps, I might be
able to hear it clearer after advancing to Sequence 8? But I’ve never
encountered anyone selling the Trickmaster potion formula.” Fors
looked out the window in a daze as her eyes were dyed red by the
moonlight.
…
On Monday morning, Klein woke up early from his restless sleep and
got out of bed.
He went to his desk and began to draw the curtains and open the
window to let the light and wind into the room.
At that moment, he caught sight of the paper on the desk at the
corner of his eye.
It was facing the window, maintaining its original spot.
However, Klein clearly remembered that before he slept, this piece of
paper was facing the chair and the bed!
It had ﬂipped over and changed orientation after a night’s sleep!
Klein’s pupils constricted as he abruptly reached out and pulled the
curtains open. He saw that the oriel windows were still shut tight, not
letting even a waft of wind in!
Without any wind, the paper had rotated hundred and eighty degrees
by itself!
No, someone came in without me noticing! Klein felt a chill run up his
spine to his head.
He was shocked that he didn’t realize it while sleeping!
This meant that he was almost at the mercy of others, and his life and
death depended solely on the other party’s mood and thoughts!
Was it a member of the military’s special department, or was it a powerful
Beyonder sent by the ambassador? From the fact that the paper wasn’t
returned to its original orientation, it’s more likely to be the latter,
indicating a certain level of warning… To be able to sneak in like that
without a trace, how incredible… Should I thank him for his kindness?
No, there must be a reason why he didn’t do something that could’ve been
so conveniently accomplished… They don’t want to alarm the members of
the military’s special department who are monitoring the area? Klein
couldn’t help but think of countless reasons.
The reason he wrote those words last night and spread the paper on
the desk, was to let others see it. He wanted to let the ambassador
know what he wanted to know and delay any possible acts of revenge
until the matter was over so that he himself could have more time to
prepare.
However, Klein had expected that the other party would sneak into
the room while he was out, and when the surveillance of his house by
the special military department would be reduced. Who knew that
the person in question was able to bypass the Beyonders around him
and quietly enter the bedroom while he was still sleeping.
The feeling of having his fate controlled by someone else was
extremely uncomfortable!
A Beyonder who’s very powerful or with extremely odd abilities… Klein
turned his back and faced away from the oriel window and pulled out
a copper penny.
“Someone sneaked into this room last night.”
…
He silently chanted the statement, and with the help of his body’s
concealment, he ﬂicked the coin.
The coin tumbled in the air and fell without exceeding Klein’s
shoulder height and landed in his open palm.
This time, the number faced up.
It was a negative result.
No one had sneaked into Klein’s bedroom last night!
The paper wouldn’t have turned around for no reason… Could it be
sleepwalking? No, I can even stay awake after the Captain invaded my
dream… Klein suddenly frowned and thought of two possibilities.
First, the divination was disrupted and resulted in misleading results.
Two, the one who sneaked in was not human!
Chapter 235: The Busy Monday
Klein was in no hurry to conﬁrm his general assumptions. He
pretended that nothing had happened and turned the page so that it
faced him.
The information he wrote about Ian Wright was completely true. He
would still get a positive answer even if he used divination
techniques to conﬁrm. Therefore, he believed that the people under
the ambassador’s charge would follow this investigations trail and
gain something in return. It was unlikely that they would have the
motivation to seek revenge on him for the time being.
Similarly, he would continue to spread the paper out on his desk for
the military’s special department who were monitoring him. It would
direct their attention away from him as they shifted their focus to Ian
Wright. It would then be a race against time to ﬁnd him before the
ambassador.
This way, Klein would be even safer.
It feels like I’m walking on a tightrope. Is this a Clown’s special trick? He
shook his head in amusement. He opened the oriel window, hoping
to take in the fresh morning air, but there was thick, choking smog
outside that made him quietly close the windows.
Pressing down the paper with Ian’s information with an ink bottle,
Klein went to the closest bathroom and quickly washed up. He then
picked up the black double-breasted suit and the half top hat that
hung from the rack and walked all the way to the ﬁrst ﬂoor.
He had an appointment with Lawyer Jurgen for breakfast today.
Pulling his black silver inlaid cane from the umbrella stand in the
foyer, Klein walked along the edge of the street in a thick fog that
provided visibility of no more than ten meters until he reached 58
Minsk Street. He rang the doorbell of the dark house.
As the clanging sound echoed, a black green-eyed cat with a raised
tail suddenly appeared in his mind.
Brody the black cat walked straight to the door. After preparing itself
for two seconds, it leaped up and grabbed the handle of the door.
Then, it inevitably fell and twisted the handle with its weight, and
opened the door.
With a creak, the morning wind blew in, and the door slowly opened.
Brody the black cat glanced at Klein haughtily as it walked to the
side.
“What a clever cat,” Klein praised as he faced the old lady, Doris, in
her white apron.
Doris laughed as her wrinkles eased.
“It depends on its mood. Most of the time it acts stupid, as though it
doesn’t know what you’re talking about. Oh, I’ve prepared my best
bean turnip soup for you. Eat it with bread.”
Bean turnip soup… Sounds like something randomly mashed together…
Klein smiled.
“I’m looking forward to it.”
The lawyer came out of the bathroom. Even at home, regardless if he
had just woken up, he was dressed to the nines. His white shirt was
ironed and his brownish-yellow vest was tightly ﬁtted, the lines of his
trousers appearing to be freshly ironed.
“The contract you wanted is complete. Check to see if there are any
omissions.” Jurgen’s blue eyes swept over. He didn’t make small talk
as he went straight to the point.
His brown hair was neatly combed back, and the sheen from the
pomade was unmistakable.
“Alright.” Klein leaned his cane, took oﬀ his hat and coat, and
followed Jurgen into the study on the ﬁrst ﬂoor, where he received a
thick contract.
He stood there, casually ﬂipping through it. The more he read, the
more his head hurt. In the end, he only skimmed through the key
clauses.
I hope that everything that’s needed is in there, as well as the previously
omitted clauses, such as the establishment of the three instances that will
determine how much money is to be supplied to Leppard based on his
progress, rather than a lump sum payment of 100 pounds. The ﬁrst
instance involves 50 pounds… Yes, that way I won’t have to go to the
Backlund Bank for the time being and take out the remaining hundred
pounds from my anonymous account. What I have on me is enough…
Klein closed the document, smiled at Jurgen, and said, “I’m satisﬁed.
Your professional skills are better than I imagined.”
As he said that, he took out two one-pound notes that he had
prepared.
Jurgen took the money, gave Klein the remaining contracts, and said
in a serious tone, “If an error is made during the signing, there are
two extra copies. Remember to shred the remaining contracts when
everything is over.”
The current iteration of shredding machines was a hand-cranked
mechanical shredder.
Klein was about to nod his head, when Mrs. Doris suddenly shouted
from the dining room, “Good lads, it’s time for breakfast!”
“My grandmother’s hearing has deteriorated,” Jurgen explained as he
invited Klein with a hand gesture.
Klein followed him into the dining room and saw that Mrs. Doris had
scooped out a spoonful of yellow and green liquid from a black pot
and poured it onto the corresponding plate.
“Here, try the bean turnip soup. Here’s your bread.” Mrs. Doris
smiled and pointed to the suspicious pile of food.
Klein looked at Jurgen who looked even more serious than before.
His heart skipped a beat.
Forcing himself to sit, Klein broke oﬀ a piece of white bread, dipped
it in the yellow-green soup, and stuﬀed it into his mouth with the
spirit of an adventurer.
“…” He was surprised to ﬁnd that the ﬂavor was actually quite good.
The faint salty taste had a sweet tang to it that stimulated his
appetite. It also perfectly brought out the soft, fragrant ﬂavor of the
bread.
“My grandmother was once an excellent cook,” Jugen said casually as
he slowly savored his breakfast.
… Then why do you have to keep a straight face… I really don’t have any
appetite watching you eat… Klein lampooned silently before immersing
himself into the relaxed and happy feelings brought by the delicacy.
After leaving the Jurgens, he made three transfers to Sird Street in St.
George Borough, where he made a formal agreement and paid
Leppard the ﬁrst ﬁfty pound. The second sum of thirty pounds would
be paid in two weeks’ time, depending on Leppard’s progress.
At this point, Klein was left with only 21 pounds 8 soli.
Then, he returned to Cherwood Borough and went to the public
library to read the Tussock Times of the past year in search of news
regarding the Intis ambassador to the Loen Kingdom.
When it was almost noon, he ﬁnally saw the black-and-white photo
and conﬁrmed that it was the one he had seen in his dream
divination.
“Bakerland Jean Madan,” Klein recited the Intis Republic’s
ambassador’s name silently. He left the library and found a small
restaurant for lunch.
…
At ten minutes to three, Klein pretended to take a nap. He drew the
curtains, took four steps in the counterclockwise direction, and
arrived above the gray fog.
He ﬁrst divined if the military’s special department had relaxed their
surveillance on him and received a positive result. He then wrote a
divination statement that he had thought of in the morning: “The
inﬁltrator from last night.”
Leaning back in his chair, he muttered the sentence. Klein’s eyelids
drooped as he fell asleep.
His bedroom came into view in a world of illusion, separation, and
obscurity.
At that moment, Klein saw a black shadow squirming in the crack at
the bottom of the door!
A slender, iron-black threadworm drilled its way into the room. It
arched at the center and then ﬂattened itself, constantly repeating it
as it proceeded towards the desk.
Its movements were extremely stiﬀ, as though it had broken down a
series of slow motions, making it appear quite odd.
The black threadworm crept to the front of the desk and crawled to
the top, leaving a trail of quickly evaporating mucus behind.
It stopped at the written piece regarding Ian Wright. Its head lifted
up as the middle of its body rose, leaving only the tail to support the
body.
At this moment, it was just like a human!
After examining it for a moment, the black-iron threadworm turned
the paper around and disappeared back the way it came from.
So that was the case… That is to say, it wasn’t that the inﬁltrator didn’t
want to take revenge on me last night; he simply didn’t have the ability to
do so… Unless this iron-black threadworm is highly venomous… Klein
nodded in enlightenment, he then used divination and obtained
conﬁrmation that the Beyonder who manipulated the black-iron
threadworm had done so under Ambassador Bakerland’s orders.
After doing all of this, he completely covered the paper bag in the
corner with gray fog and sent a message to The Sun, Derrick.
When the hands of the pocket watch were in place, Klein pulled in
Justice, The Hanged Man, and The Sun at the same time.
This week’s Tarot Club happened as scheduled!
…
The familiar gray fog and blurry human silhouettes appeared.
Audrey, who had successfully advanced to Sequence 8, half stood up,
lifted her skirt, and happily greeted them, “Good afternoon, Mr.
Fool~ Good afternoon, Mr. Hanged Man! Good afternoon, Mr. Sun!”
Klein, who had activated his Spirit Vision earlier, noticed the change
in the surface layer of the Astral Projection in the depths of Miss
Justice’s Ether Body with the help of the gray fog’s uniqueness. With
a chuckle, he said, “Welcome, our ‘Miss Telepathist.'”
Audrey smiled reservedly and said a few words of humility before
turning to face the person across her.
“Mr. Hanged Man, you should be handing this week’s six pages.”
Perhaps, when Mr. Fool reads it, he will think of something and shares
with us a little more of his “general knowledge”… The corners of her
mouth curled up in anticipation.
Alger nodded and began to produce the six pages of Roselle’s diary
with Klein’s help.
Previously, he had thought about consulting The Fool about whether
he should directly submit the rest of the diary via a sacriﬁce.
However, seeing that The Fool didn’t seem too interested or take the
initiative to mention it, he gave up on this idea.
And this was in line with his understanding of The Fool. Roselle’s
diary had a certain eﬀect on the godlike-man—Mr. Fool—but it
wasn’t that great. He would collect it, but he deﬁnitely wasn’t in a
rush.
The six pages of the diary were completed very quickly. As Alger was
about to oﬀer it to The Fool who sat at the end of the long bronze
table, he suddenly remembered something. He hurriedly said
respectfully, “Mr. Fool, I have obtained a piece of information related
to the Secret Order.”
There was no obstruction of information on the ocean; it just wasn’t
timely enough.
The pirates also valued intelligence and often sent people to the
colonial island to exchange information that they had gathered. It
was through these channels that Alger learned something about the
Secret Order.
“Very good.” Klein nodded his head slightly, giving his permission to
The Hanged Man to recount what he knew. He didn’t stop the
presence of Miss Justice and The Sun from letting him speak.
This would help the former gather more information about the Secret
Order, while the latter understood nothing.
At the same time, he allowed the six-page diary to appear in his
hands.
The Hanged Man said unhurriedly, “The Secret Order has some
connection with the Intis Republic.”
The Intis Republic. Yes, Emperor Republic was from Intis, and Zaratul had
sought him out in Trier, the capital of Intis… The Secret Order was also
involved in the famous incident at Intis… Well, it’s not too surprising that
the Secret Order still has some connection with the Intis Republic today…
After validating this new piece of information with what he knew,
Klein conﬁrmed that the information provided by The Hanged Man
was true.
Heh, just in time, I’m going to deal with the ambassador of the Intis
Republic… Klein was in no hurry to read Roselle’s diary. He looked up
at the three members.
Chapter 236: Internal
Commission
As Klein’s knowledge of mysticism and Beyonders deepened, as well
as his experiments with some of the powers of the space above the
gray fog, he no longer felt anxious when facing Justice, The Hanged
Man, and The Sun. He became less preoccupied with maintaining an
enigmatic and unfathomable image so as to prevent the Tarot Club
members from keenly noticing his facade.
He now knew that although the deities in this world were powerful
and bizarre, they were by no means omniscient and omnipotent. This
description was something that only the legendary Creator of
everything could do, one that only the City of Silver was still
worshiping.
The deities had their limitations, and the deities could also be put
into tough situations. That was something Klein could now conﬁrm.
Be it The Book of Storms or The Revelation of Evernight, they more
or less touched upon this.
Therefore, at the recent Tarot Gathering, Klein was consciously
building “character traits,” slowly shaping himself into a restricted
powerhouse who, for some reason, couldn’t move freely but was
almost a deity.
This way, even if he occasionally showed that he didn’t understand
certain things and occasionally asked for help, it wouldn’t arouse the
suspicion of the Tarot Club members.
Of course, the premise of all this was that, through his previous
attempts and through the power displayed by his “adorer,” Azik, he
had undoubtedly embedded the image of a deity-like existence into
the minds of Justice, The Hanged Man, and The Sun.
Phew, I hope that this building of character traits will succeed. That way, I
won’t have to worry about not being able to answer their questions in the
future… Of course, things that are part of “general knowledge” still have
to be known, and I shouldn’t show fear… Klein tapped the edge of the
ancient table and said with a chuckle, “I want to issue a mission.”
Mission? Audrey’s ears pricked up slightly as her eyes widened. She
was astonished, expectant, and perturbed at the same time.
She clearly remembered that this was the ﬁrst time that Mr. Fool had
oﬃcially issued a mission!
Although “He” had previously made a few requests, they all involved
prepaid rewards. It seemed like “He” had randomly selected missions to
conform to the principle of equal exchange… This time, He used the word
“issue”… As a Telepathist, Audrey was already very good at reading
the hidden meanings behind words.
At the same time, she keenly realized that although The Hanged Man
appeared to remain unperturbed, he was actually abnormally tense.
As for The Sun, he seemed to be muddle-headed, treating this as a
very normal thing.
“You can choose to accept it or not.” With the help of his Clown’s
powers, Klein’s tone sounded much more relaxed. “Another adorer of
mine has arrived in Backlund. He wants to ﬁnish a matter, but it’s not
convenient for him to show himself.”
Another adorer… The Hanged Man nodded, seemingly in thought. He
wasn’t surprised at all.
In his eyes, for a powerful godlike existence like Mr. Fool, possessing
many adorers was a matter of fact.
I wonder what the Sequence number of Mr. Fool’s adorer is… Well, I still
owe “His” previous adorer a reward… Even though Mr. Fool’s reward was
paid by Mr. Hanged Man, and “He” doesn’t really care about money, I
did pray for help at that time. Furthermore, Rear Admiral Hurricane was
killed by that adorer…”His” adorer would still need some funds for their
activities… Audrey thought with some guilt.
Frankly speaking, thirty thousand gold pounds and a large plantation
was an enormous amount of wealth to her, but that alone didn’t have
any signiﬁcant eﬀect on her life.
It’s good having it, but it didn’t matter if I didn’t. Well, I might feel the
pinch a little…Audrey nodded to herself earnestly.
As a teenage girl who wasn’t considered an adult yet, ignoring the
large plantation, she actually didn’t have absolute control over the
remaining thirty thousand pounds. She could only go with her
father’s arrangements, purchasing some stocks from Backlund
Munitions Corporation and invest in a company that was attempting
to spinoﬀ some of the technology in ironclad warships for
commercial ships.
The amount she ultimately received and could be used as an
allowance was only 5000 pounds. However, her ﬁxed annuity had
increased by at least 2000 pounds from its original range of 15,000 to
25,000 pounds.
Seeing that Justice and the others hadn’t spoken, Klein issued the
mission.
“The task he wants to be completed is the assassination of the Intis
Republic ambassador to the Loen Kingdom, Bakerland Jean Madan.”
“Assassinate the Intis Republic’s ambassador!?” Audrey lost her
composure as she asked in surprise.
This would cause conﬂict between the two countries and might even
be an act of war! As a qualiﬁed aristocratic lady, her ﬁrst thought
was about international foreign aﬀairs.
As for why Mr. Fool didn’t do so himself, she found the answer
obvious.
Which mighty ﬁgure would always be helping their subordinates?
After the Kingdom suﬀered defeat at the east coast of Balam, the King
didn’t personally set oﬀ. At most, the general would be replaced and
new troops deployed.
Hmm, rumor has it that His Majesty wanted to set oﬀ for the frontline,
but was stopped by the nobles and oﬃcials…
Alger was only mildly surprised by the task; his focus was on another
matter.
Mr. Fool is indeed unable to strongly interfere with the real world… My
guess is right… I wonder to what extent can “He” inﬂuence us after
establishing our connection… Can “He” easily take one’s life away?
Alger, a little pleased with himself, began to let his thoughts wander.
Derrick blanked out listening to the conversation.
What’s the Intis Republic? What’s an ambassador? These words sound so
strange in Jotun!
Klein swept his gaze around and maintained his casual attitude.
“Which one of you is willing to accept this mission?
“What kind of reward do you want?”
Eh… I can’t convince myself to kill an innocent man for no reason. And it
could very well lead to a disaster, a disaster caused by war… Audrey,
who wanted to raise her hand, hesitated.
Just then, The Hanged Man chuckled and said, “I’ve heard that this
Ambassador Bakerland is also the intelligence chief of the Intis
Republic in the Kingdom. He secretly supports bloodshed, planned a
number of incidents that destroyed the relationship between the
nobility and the rich, and spread rumors to incite the public into
standing against the government.”
He seemed to notice the hesitation in Justice, so he described the
dark side of Bakerland in detail.
Then, he added, “I’m not sure if the ambassador is a Beyonder, but
there are many clues that suggest he may very well be.
“He has quite a number of Beyonders around him, Beyonders that
come under the Intis intelligence web. And this department is
inﬂuenced by the original royal family in Intis, the Sauron family.
They’re in control of the early Sequences of the Hunter pathway.
“Moreover, the possibility of a war between the two countries
depends only on whether or not the upper echelons of both sides
want to ﬁght. It has nothing to do with the life or death of a
diplomat.”
After the assassination of Emperor Roselle, Intis suﬀered several great
shocks but ultimately managed to maintain a stable republican
system. Because the Sauron family suﬀered a brutal blow during
Roselle’s reign, their strength fell tremendously in all aspects. All
they could do was accept the reality and change their goal to ﬁghting
for a seat in parliament and secretly inﬂuence the country’s
intelligence department and parts of the army.
After listening to the information provided by The Hanged Man, the
hesitation in Audrey’s heart disappeared. She gracefully nodded and
said, “For the past few years, the Feysac Empire has expanded
rapidly, having defeated the Kingdom and the Intis Republic on the
Balam east coast and the Highlands. As long as we push the blame to
them, the higher-ups and the citizens of the Intis Empire, it will be
something acceptable and believable.”
Audrey didn’t know much about politics, but with her father being a
Member of Parliament in the House of Lords, she still knew certain
things.
Be it the shirking of responsibility or shifting the focus onto the
Kingdom’s internal problems, the unpopular northern barbarians
were the popular and easiest targets for the nobles and ministers.
Whether they did it or not didn’t matter.
Of course, more than a hundred years ago, this role was played by
Intis and Roselle.
After pondering for a few seconds, Audrey looked at the seat of
honor, feeling a little perturbed and a little guilty.
“Mr. Fool, I can attempt to complete this mission, but I cannot
guarantee its success.”
On the one hand, she was going to ﬁnd her father and conﬁrm that
Ambassador Bakerland was really the head of the Intis intelligence
service. On the other hand, she wasn’t going to do it herself either. As
a Spectator or a Telepathist, neither one of them was good at combat,
and all she could do was gather as much information about
Ambassador Backlund from high society as she could and delegate
the mission.
Well, I could get Xio and Fors to ask Mr. A to do it… Or ﬁnd the hosts of
the other Beyonder circles… I cannot be exposed. Things have to be kept
secret, and there might be Intis intelligence agents lurking in those circles. I
don’t know how much money I’ll have to pay, but 5000 pounds might not
be enough… Audrey was already beginning to think of the subsequent
plans.
Klein didn’t pin his hopes on Sequence 8—Miss Justice—to succeed.
He nodded and said, “What compensation would you like?”
“The formula to the Psychiatrist potion,” Audrey said before
hesitantly adding, “as well as the corresponding Beyonder
ingredients. Oh, we can wait until the mission is completed before
discussing further. If it doesn’t succeed, I’ll bear the expenses. I-I still
ow-owe your adorer the bounty money.”
Bounty money? So it was given to Miss Justice… 10,000 pounds. That’s
5000 if we split it equally… Shrouded in the gray fog, Klein pondered
for a few seconds on how much Ambassador Bakerland was worth
and ﬁnally decided that he was deﬁnitely more valuable than Rear
Admiral Hurricane Qilangos.
“Sure,” Klein replied in a normal tone.
At this moment, The Hanged Man Alger added, “I’ll also accept this
mission. The compensation can be determined after the mission is
completed.”
“Didn’t you return to the sea?” Audrey asked in surprise.
“Just because I’m not in Backlund doesn’t mean I can’t kill
Ambassador Bakerland,” Alger said with a smile without giving any
detailed explanations.
Derrick, who was beside him, never had the chance to join in on the
conversation.
Klein nodded in agreement.
“Okay.”
He immediately turned his gaze to the Roselle diary in his hands.
Chapter 237: Sequence 2
“29th October. The leader of the Secret Order, Zaratul, visited me
once again. He didn’t mention anything speciﬁc and just casually
chatted with me. I wasn’t able to guess his true intentions. It seems
like he just wanted to strengthen the communication between us and
understand each other better?
“I’ve already met the two High-Sequence Beyonders from the Church,
but I felt that Zaratul was much more powerful and mysterious than
them, so I asked him what Sequence number he was without much
hope, and in the end, he actually answered me!
“He told me that he was a Sequence 2, Miracle Invoker!
“Sequence 2? In the Church’s categorization, that’s the position of an
angel, close to that of a deity!
“He truly is more powerful than the Alchemist and Arcane Scholar
that I met before!
“But my intuition tells me that Zaratul isn’t telling the whole truth.
Sequence 2 might just be his former position, or that he’s about to
advance.
“Miracle Invoker? A master at creating miracles? The name of this
potion makes one’s imagination run wild!
“This is the corresponding Sequence 2 of Seer, a Miracle Invoker who
controls fate?
“I tried probing Zaratul if the word miracle refers to the miracle of
fate? That the Seer pathway is one that slowly understands and
grasps fate so as to control it?
“Zaratul ignored the ﬁrst question. He told me that fate is just one of
the parts of the Seer pathway, and it’s not even its main focus. The
pathway that truly represents fate is Monster!
“He raised a few examples which were all potion names of the
Monster Sequence. Sequence 7 The Lucky, Sequence 5 The Lucky,
Sequence 2 Soothsayer, and Sequence 1 Snake of Mercury! It’s also
known as the Snake of Fate.
“This was the ﬁrst Sequence 1 I got to know. It hit me right in the
face!
“According to what I know, the Monster pathway should be
controlled by the Life School of Thought. This school seems to also
have parts of the Apothecary Sequence pathway. They propose three
major divisions, the world of absolute rationality, the world of the
spirit, and the material world. Yea, it’s pretty cool.
“Zaratul told me that the Life School of Thought specializes in
astromancy, seeking to use medicine, music, light, wine, and
fragrance, to eliminate paths with unfavorable star readings and fate.
They believe that disasters and diseases are caused by the loss of
balance between man and nature, as well as the balance between
man and his own mind.
“He added meaningfully that the Life School of Thought worships the
moon.
“Why worship the moon and not go one step further, the Evernight
Goddess?”
This diary took up two pages and was clearly copied from both sides
of the original.
That’s a lot of information… Klein sighed in heartfelt silence.
This was also the ﬁrst time he was learning of a Sequence 1 potion’s
name.
Snake of Mercury and Snake of Fate really made one feel a pining
for!
Similarly, it’s my ﬁrst time learning of a Sequence 2. I now know the
corresponding Sequence 2 of Seer… The name Miracle Invoker sounds
pretty good. It contains deep meaning and doesn’t sound lowly. Of course,
compared to Soothsayer, it does seem a little inferior…
Fate is only part of the Seer pathway and it’s not even its main focus. I
have to remember this. I should constantly reﬂect on myself and not end
up steering towards fate. It might result in the failure of my “acting”…
Zaratul’s words don’t seem contradictory… The Monster pathway is the
real path of fate… So, Soothsayer is a Sequence 2. If that’s the case, then
I already knew of a Sequence 2 in the past…
Although he didn’t take his eyes oﬀ the paper, Klein was seriously
considering his own Sequence chain.
Due to his experience in digesting the two potions, “Seer” and
“Clown,” and because he could spy and revere fate, he was able to be
a little prescient regarding fate. However, he would still be helpless
toward the development of fate. He had slowly been equating the
essence of his Beyonder pathway to fate. If it wasn’t for this diary, it
was very likely that he would’ve used this as a premise to
comprehend and “act” for the subsequent Sequences.
As for whether or not Zaratul was lying, what Klein was certain of
was that the Monster pathway was deﬁnitely the Sequence of Fate,
which was consistent with what he had seen from the conﬁdential
information of the Nighthawks and with the potion name he had
heard of earlier, “Soothsayer.”
Now that there was a Fate Sequence, the “Seer” pathway was
unlikely to be a repeat. This would result in some degree of
overlapping, and it would be inconsistent with how each of the
current Sequences had diﬀerent characteristics.
Therefore, Klein was inclined to believe what Zaratul had said. He
was inclined to believe that fate was only part of the Seer’s pathway,
not even its main focus.
The value of these two pages is invaluable to the present me… The
Alchemist and the Arcane Scholar should be the higher Sequences of the
Savant pathway. From Roselle’s tone, they deﬁnitely don’t belong to
Sequence 2 and 1. That is to say, they are Sequence 4 and Sequence 3…
For the time being, it’s impossible to determine which is Sequence 4 and
which is Sequence 3… Klein gathered his thoughts, ﬂipped the diary,
and continued reading.
As for why the Life School of Thought only worshiped the moon and
didn’t believe in the Evernight Goddess which symbolized the
crimson moon, he was unable to ponder too deeply about it due to
the lack of information.
The third page was Roselle’s recount of inventing a practical steam
engine. At times, he was afraid of suﬀering crackdowns, and at other
times, afraid that the fruits of his labor would be seized by powerful
ﬁgures. His words displayed his fear of being persecuted.
To think that even Emperor Roselle, who thought of himself as the
protagonist of an era, would have such a perturbed and worried side
to him… The corners of Klein’s mouth twitched as he ﬂipped to the
fourth page of the diary.
“18th April. Matilda is pregnant.
“It’s to be expected, and I can even tell you exactly which love-
making session she conceived in, because I felt a decrease in my
Beyonder characteristic.
“Once the conception is successful, my own Beyonder characteristic
will follow a mysterious connection, and part of it will be transferred
to my child.
“After that, I asked Archbishop Fan Esti worriedly. He told me that
this is a normal phenomenon. For Sequence 7 and below, Beyonder
characteristics will not be passed on to the next generation, but it
isn’t absolute, Sequence 6 and 5 will naturally pass down a portion,
but it will not aﬀect the parent’s strength. As for the child, they
would be born with certain Beyonder powers, close to that of
Sequence 9. But as a result, their pathway is basically ﬁxed.
“At high Sequences, the inheritance of Beyonder characteristics is
something one can control. One can choose to pass down or not, or
one can even choose to pass down just a little bit, a third, half, or all
of them.
“In other words, the children born from High-Sequence Beyonders
might be born as Beyonders. As for the Sequence number, it’s up to
either one of the parents to decide.
“I wonder if the descendants of the deities are like this as well…”
After reading the diary, there were only two phrases in Klein’s mind:
“Law of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility” and “Law of
Beyonder Characteristics Conservation.”
Is the law governing the survival of Beyonder creatures? It’s no wonder
that some magical animals will reproduce only before they die… It’s no
wonder there would be the phenomenon of increased killing and bloodlust
after childbirth. The target would be of their own race or even their
partner. This is to supplement their Beyonder characteristics… According
to this logic, if we trace this all the way back, where did the earliest
Beyonder characteristics come from? Produced out of thin air? From the
Creator who created everything?
Since Miss Justice had already advanced to Telepathist, Klein
controlled the urge to nod and continued to leaf through the pages.
The ﬁfth page was Roselle’s criticisms about how no one could enjoy
his pop music and thought that he was making noise, while at the
same time, he mused how refreshing stories was a common pursuit of
diﬀerent people from diﬀerent worlds, and that the popularity of the
novels he plagiarized from The Count of Monte Cristo allowed the
newspaper he founded to ﬂourish.
… Emperor, is there anything else you haven’t done? With a smile, Klein
turned to the sixth and ﬁnal page.
“10th November, I received the great pirate Savigny Solomon in
secret at the White Maple Palace. Solomon. I hope that he will
plunder my opponents on the new sea route and strike at the ships of
Feysac, Loen, and Feynapotter.
“And I promised to help him advance to a High-Sequence Beyonder.
“The Beyonder pathway of Dark Emperor has names that are as
strange as the Demoness pathway—Corruption, Confusion, The
Fallen, Disorder… However, in order to match the Dark Emperor,
they added on their own suﬃxes, Baron of Corruption, Mentor of
Confusion, Count of The Fallen, and Prince of Disorder.
“In order for Savigny to live up to his name, I decided to confer him
the title of Count of the Court in secret.
“Savigny has a child named Nast Solomon, and my intuition tells me
that he will dominate the Five Seas in the future.”
Nast Solomon… The King of the Five Seas, Nast? Nast, who claims to be
a descendant of the Solomon Empire? To think that he was born during
the Roselle period! Klein was stunned.
Since Roselle had mentioned the term “new sea route,” Klein had
easily determined the corresponding year.
It was in 1194 that the new sea route was discovered and the
Southern Continent was found, and Roselle was assassinated in 1198.
The diary could only have been written between those two years.
That also meant that it was about 151 to 155 years ago.
If Nast, the “King of the Five Seas,” was the Nast Solomon, Roselle had
spoken of, he’s almost 160 years old… Is this due to other reasons, or do
High-Sequence Beyonders obtain an extension to their lifespan in the ﬁrst
place… Klein thought seriously.
He gathered his thoughts and let the diary disappear from his hands.
He then looked at Justice and said, “You are free to trade or
communicate now.”
Mr. Fool has no general knowledge to tell us today… Audrey was
slightly disappointed. She turned her gaze to Sun and said, “Can I
exchange information related to the dragon from you?”
She clearly remembered that Mr. Sun called the Spectator pathway
“the Dragon pathway,” and that he said it originated from the Dragon
race.
“Sure. I want the Sequence 8 potion formula for Bard,” answered The
Sun, Derrick, who had been silent all this while, in hesitation.
He had wanted to use this as an exchange for information on the
world where Justice and The Hanged Man were living so that he
wouldn’t always be confounded by what he heard. However, seeing
that his process of digesting the potion was nearing completion, he
still made his advancement his top priority.
Chapter 238: Dragon of
Imagination
Audrey wasn’t surprised by The Sun’s request. Since the “acting
method” had proliferated in the City of Silver, then the amount of
time that had passed suggested that it was likely that he was close to
the end of his digestion period. Seeking the subsequent potion
formula was deﬁnitely one of his highest priorities.
I wonder how the Bard acts? Sing poetry every day? When encountering
combat, dodge to the side and use his singing to bring courage and
strength to his companions? Or perhaps he would ﬁrst bless himself before
charging forward with a hammer or sword raised? I wonder if it will bring
about an improvement in his singing ability. If it’s possible, then he would
deﬁnitely be an outstanding singer or opera singer… Audrey thought
with great interest. She purposely didn’t express her stance in a
hurry, so as to not let The Sun raise the price again.
This wasn’t something she learned from her tutor or from the
Beyonder gatherings she had attended. It was purely a technique she
had developed herself after she had advanced to become a
Telepathist.
“I will try my best to ﬁnd the Sequence 8 potion formula
corresponding to the Bard pathway, but it won’t be today. Are you
satisﬁed with this condition?” Audrey said in deliberation before
looking at the seat of honor at the ancient table. “We can seek Mr.
Fool’s help to bear witness to this agreement.”
At that moment, Klein laughed and replied, “Miss Justice, perhaps I
can provide the Light Suppliant formula for you.”
Audrey’s eyes lit up as she quickly nodded slightly.
“No problem! Then, what should I use to exchange with you?”
I haven’t thought of it yet… Klein chuckled and said, “Don’t worry;
perhaps my adorers will require help in certain matters in the
future.”
His thoughts were very simple. If he allowed Miss Justice to obtain
the formula of Light Suppliant in her Beyonder circles, then wouldn’t
the knowledge he had stolen from the Eternal Blazing Sun at the cost
of near immolation be for naught?
At the very least, it would be wasted at the Tarot Club!
“Alright, I will do my best to help them!” Audrey promised happily.
Klein pressed his hands together and a yellowish-brown piece of
goatskin parchment appeared before him. On it was the formula for
the Light Suppliant potion, including substitute ingredients and their
ancient names. Furthermore, they were all translated to Jotun.
“Main ingredients: a piece of Brilliance Rock or powder of Dazzling
Soul; Blood of a Mirror Hedgehog or the Heart of a Magma Titan;
Supplementary ingredients: a Golden-edged Sunﬂower, three drops of
Aconite Juice…”
With a gentle push, the goatskin appeared in front of The Sun.
Although he could pray to Mr. Fool to recall the formula even if he
forgot it completely, Derrick still diligently memorized the formula. It
took him quite a while before he said, “Miss Justice, we can talk
about the dragons.”
“Mr. Fool, I seek your permission to speak with Mr. Sun alone.”
Audrey quickly raised her hand.
She originally believed that The Sun would put the appropriate
content on paper for her to read, but it would be inconvenient for her
to ask questions. She would have to pen her questions and push them
back to him. Such a way of communication was utterly cumbersome.
Speak with him alone? In such a conversation, you probably wouldn’t
understand what The Sun is saying; likewise for The Sun… Klein nodded
as his voice remained placid.
“Alright.”
In the Beyonder circles, Hermes was a language one had to master.
Ancient Hermes was something that one could learn and was
relatively popular. Jotun, Dragonese, and Elvish were relatively less
popular, so few people knew them.
The moment that was said, Klein isolated The Hanged Man,
preventing him from seeing or hearing.
Alger had a certain interest in the knowledge of the dragons, but it
wasn’t enough for him to pay the price of listening, so he kept silent
and waited.
Seeing that Mr. Fool had made a gesture for them to start talking,
The Sun, Derrick, remained silent for a few seconds, organized his
words, and said, “The dragons are mortal enemies of the Giant King.
They all look like magniﬁed lizards, and their entire bodies are
covered in scales of diﬀerent colors. Their four limbs are thick and
powerful, and their wings are wide enough to drive their giant bodies
to ﬂight. They are the rulers of the sky.
“They have a myriad of abilities, some have the ability to breathe
ﬁre, others the ability to command lightning, bring corrosion, or even
creating frost. But these are not mainstream among the dragons. The
Dragon of the Mind occupies the greatest number of dragons with
Dragon King Ankewelt as their representative. The Beyonder pathway
that stems from the Dragon of the Mind is the Spectator. In the City
of Silver, we typically call it the Dragon pathway.”
With regards to similar trades, Derrick had initially prepared to
regurgitate the historical texts, but upon discovering that Miss Justice
and Mr. Hanged Man didn’t seem to share the same “world,” he
gradually realized the value of the widely-known history of the City
of Silver. Thus, he only talked about dragons this time and spoke
nothing of giants, elves, mutants, phoenixes, vampires, etc.
The King of Dragons Ankewelt… This aligns with the records of the
Church… Audrey nodded slightly, politely refraining from
interrupting The Sun’s narration.
Derrick recalled the contents of his textbook and said, “Back then, the
most powerful and most terrifying dragon was the Dragon King
Ankewelt, also known as the Dragon of Imagination. Apart from it,
his son, Alzuhod blanketed the sky as well, overlooking the famous,
powerful ﬁgures across the land and sea. Its name was the Dragon of
Nightmare.
“Regarding the Dragon of Imagination Ankewelt, there was a legend
that whatever he imagined would manifest. The kingdom he
imagined would deﬁnitely descend upon the material world. The
future it declares would deﬁnitely play out and become reality.”
This… Klein suddenly frowned. If it wasn’t for the fact that Justice
Audrey was focused on listening to The Sun, she deﬁnitely would’ve
noticed his abnormality, even if he was covered by the thick gray fog.
The description made him think of Sealed Artifact 0-08!
A declared future would deﬁnitely play out… They share similar
characteristics!Klein leaned back in his chair; he looked relaxed, but in
fact, he was even more focused.
Dragon of Imagination, how cool… That’s the mark of a deity! Audrey’s
eyes lit up when she heard him, ﬁlled with excitement and
anticipation.
Derrick paused for a few seconds before continuing, “Its son, Dragon
of Nightmare, Alzuhod, is similarly terrifying. It can control the
hearts of every living creature and make them act according to his
will. And these living creatures will ﬁnd it hard to sense it, believing
that their actions were of their own will. It will also fabricate real
nightmares into reality, causing many living creatures to
unknowingly participate in them. It would then give them the
cruelest and shocking ends.
“Legend has it that it especially loves mischief, that it will let a prince
kiss a princess to wake her up, but the princess has already mostly
rotten away. It will make ordinary girls wear dancing shoes and
dance in front of the prince, but ﬁnd themselves unable to do so until
their deaths. It will create all kinds of coincidences and push the fates
of many living creatures towards tragedy.”
All kinds of coincidences… This sounds even more like a 0-08… Of
course, I don’t know much about the Sealed Artifact… Klein resisted the
urge to stroke his chin as he made himself look like an immutable
ancient well.
“What a vile dragon… However, its abilities are very interesting,”
Audrey said, half sighing, half excited.
Is this the future of the Spectator pathway? No, I have to call it the
Dragon pathway! I don’t want to switch to another Sequence! Audrey
wished that she could immediately become a Sequence 7 Psychiatrist
and continue her rapid advancement.
The Sun Derrick answered sincerely, “It has been two to three
thousand years since the history of the dragon and the Giant King.
Everything I know comes from textbooks and legends, so there is no
guarantee of its authenticity.”
“At least your history remains intact.” Audrey was in a good mood.
“And then?”
“Then? The Creator awoke, and the Dragon of Imagination, the
Dragon of Nightmare, and other famous dragons fell from the sky,
losing everything, including their lives. This resulted in a lack of
sunlight for 49 days, causing countless volcanoes to erupt, as well as
tides that drowned everything. And after the dragons declined, they
could only hide away in various dangerous areas. Later on, the Giant
King was destroyed by the Creator as well,” Derrick said in a heavy
tone.
This is diﬀerent from the history I know… Wasn’t it the Lord of Storms,
Eternal Blazing Sun, and the God of Knowledge and Wisdom who led
humanity to defeat the dragons, giants, and kill their kings? Audrey felt
confused, as though time and history were somehow out of place.
Klein was also puzzled by this and felt that the true history was
riddled with mysteries, especially as it was from the Second Epoch, a
time more ancient than history.
Most of the legends recorded in the Church’s ancient texts should be fake,
but the history of the City of Silver cannot be completely believed… What
would real history be like? He gathered his thoughts, smiled and asked,
“Is the exchange over?”
“That’s all I know,” Derrick replied in shame.
He felt that the information he had provided didn’t match the value
of the Light Suppliant potion formula.
Audrey quietly drew a breath, as the corners of her mouth curved
upwards.
“I’m very satisﬁed.”
I know my future direction… she added happily in her mind.
After a few more exchanges, Klein announced the end of this week’s
Tarot Club.
After sending oﬀ Miss Justice and the others, he didn’t linger any
longer and quickly returned to his bedroom to reduce the risk of
being discovered by others.
…
In Empress Borough, the opulent villa of Count Hall.
Audrey happily paced back and forth, planning to reward Susie with
a few dog treats.
Just then, she heard a knock at the door.
From the sound of her footsteps and the gait, she could tell that it
was her personal maid, Annie.
“Come in.” Audrey looked at the mirror, smoothed her hair, and
straightened her back.
Annie came in with a piece of paper and smiled.
“Miss, a telegram for you came from the Southern Continent.”
Southern Continent? Alfred? Audrey suddenly thought of her elder
brother, took the paper in delight, and examined it closely.
It was indeed from her second elder brother, Alfred Hall. He had sent
a telegram from the east coast of the Balam Empire and it read:
“I’ve found the Rainbow Salamander you wanted. Two in total.
Please await its delivery.”
But, I don’t need it anymore… Audrey froze, blinked, and turned her
head sharply to Susie.
The large golden retriever wagged her tail with a stupeﬁed
expression.
Chapter 239: Each Having Their
Own "Gathering"
Well, I don’t need it anymore, but I can give it to Susie, and I can
exchange it for other Beyonder ingredients. Well, Susie’s potion is still
short of the spinal ﬂuid from a Farsman Rabbit… Some things are easier
left to Susie, it’s far more convenient for her than for me… Every “famous
detective” needs a good assistant. Uh-huh! Audrey quickly made her
decision. To her, this was no longer something she particularly cared
about.
As she put down the telegram, her pleasure subsided, and the worries
of reality began to emerge.
I still owe Mr. Fool intelligence regarding the Secret Order, the mission to
assassinate the Intis ambassador, and a request from his adorer… I’ve
ﬁnally experienced the feeling of being riddled in debt… Audrey, we can’t
delay any longer! Let’s start! The girl quietly clenched her ﬁsts. She
wanted to ﬁnd a pen and paper and write a letter to Viscount Glaint
so that he could arrange for her to meet Xio and Fors as soon as
possible. She needed to delegate the mission.
She picked up a fountain pen, dipped it in ink, and suddenly, Audrey
held her wrist in midair without writing.
She had just thought of a crucial problem which was that she knew
very little about the Intis ambassador Bakerland. In such cases, it was
easy to misjudge the diﬃculty of a mission, either because no one
was willing to accept it or because the mission had been entrusted to
an unsuitable person, dooming the mission to fail at the very
beginning.
The resulting growing cost wasn’t her main concern; instead, she
believed that The Fool would better reward her and help her even
further.
After pondering for a moment, Audrey turned her head to her
maidservant, Annie, and said, “Tell Countess Jaria that I accept her
invitation and will punctually attend her ball tomorrow evening.”
Jaria was the wife of Count Wolfe, and she had invited ambassadors
to Loen from every country to her upcoming ball, including
Bakerland Jean Madan.
Audrey had planned on declining the invitation with the excuse of
being sick, but now she was interested in the ball.
After she observed Ambassador Bakerland and gathered enough
information, she would meet with Xio and Fors! Audrey suddenly felt
the excitement of participating in a major event that she always
dreamed of!
…
First Manor in the Rorsted Archipelago, City of Generosity, Bayam.
Having returned to the real world, Alger Wilson changed into attire
that was considered gaudy in the Intis Republic and went through the
back door of the hotel into the alley and made several detours.
He stopped in front of a house with no garden or lawn and put on a
familiar white mask.
Next, he knocked on the door with three heavy knocks and two light
ones, separating them with two lengthy pauses and two short pauses
respectively.
After about ten seconds, the door creaked open. A man wearing a
pirate’s headband stuck his head out and looked around quickly.
“Come in,” the man said with a deep voice as he made way.
Without a word, Alger quietly walked into the room.
Creak!
The door slammed shut.
…
At 15 Minsk Street, Klein drew the curtains open and sat down at his
desk.
The information about the Secret Order that was given to him by The
Hanged Man made him realize that his target might have certain
connections to the Intis Republic. At the same time, he was reminded
of the words The Hanged Man had used to describe the Antigonus
family—”strange” and “terrifying.”
The Beyonder who sneaked into my room last night to read the
information and leave me a warning was indeed strange… The Sequence
pathway that the Antigonus family has in their control is the Seer pathway
which the Secret Order possesses. The two can be equated… That is to
say, one can speculate that the Beyonder from last night was a member of
the Secret Order who works part-time as an Intis Republic spy? Or could
the person not be a member of the Secret Order, but someone who used
the connection between the Intis Republic and the Secret Order to obtain
the corresponding formulas and potions? Klein began to boldly assume
that as he carefully tried to verify.
This can explain why my Clown’s premonition ability didn’t trigger when
the strange threadworm intruded. This is the suppression eﬀect of a
Beyonder from a higher Sequence that shares the same pathway as me…
Of course, it’s also possible that the iron-black threadworm posed no
concrete threat to me…
Similarly, it can be explained why the threadworm inﬁltrated my room the
same night that I wrote the information regarding Ian Wright.
Furthermore, it went straight for the desk… The other party is equipped
with Seer abilities, making matters appear reasonably logical…
After repeatedly verifying his speculation, Klein felt that his guess
was very likely close to the truth.
If the person in question is a relatively higher Sequence Beyonder from the
Seer pathway, what Sequence number would he be? And what would the
potion name be? To have the threadworm in his control, could it be
another component of a circus, the Beast Tamer? Klein shook his head
in a self-deprecating manner while feeling amused.
Perhaps my subsequent potion formula will be obtained from him… Is this
the true meaning of the revelation I received from my former divination?
Backlund really is the Land of Hope… Klein muttered a few words to
himself and began to consider what to do next.
He had entrusted the task of assassinating the Intis Ambassador
Bakerland to put an end to all latent dangers. He had to avoid
suspicion, but he didn’t have the ability needed to do so.
After Ian Wright’s whereabouts were revealed to both sides, he was
conﬁdent that Ambassador Bakerland wouldn’t have time to exact
revenge on him in the near future and wouldn’t add to his problems.
Finding the extremely important item he mentioned was obviously
what he was most concerned about.
In other words, before that item is found, I will be safe. I won’t need to
rush to hire powerful, Beyonder bodyguards… Hmm, even if there’s any
follow-up revenge, it’s unlikely the ambassador will hire a High-Sequence
Beyonder to deal with me. It’s neither economical nor necessary; after all,
Backlund isn’t his home ground…
The highest possibility is that he would still get the Beyonder who sent the
iron-black threadworm to inﬁltrate my room last night. He would at least
be at Sequence 7, and perhaps even Sequence 6 or 5. He has the strength
required and is familiar with the situation… When the time comes, I just
need to hire a bodyguard according to this standard… I hope that before
then, the Ambassador will never be able to issue such an order… Klein
looked out of the window at the fog which had ﬁnally dissipated,
seemingly in a daze.
He decided to continue heading to Bravehearts Bar tonight. Firstly,
this was to come into contact with other Beyonders through Kaspars
so as to choose a suitable bodyguard. Secondly, he could ﬁnd an
opportunity to sell Meursault’s Beyonder characteristic, gather some
funds, and see if anyone was selling any powerful mystic items to
enhance his strength. This was a plan that would never go out of
date.
After conﬁrming his plan, Klein pretended to leisurely read the
newspaper. He waited until the sky turned dark before slowly getting
up and making himself tomato oxtail soup.
After eating and drinking to his heart’s content, he drew the bedroom
curtains as usual and decided not to open them tonight.
Then, summoning himself and responding to himself, he turned into
the unique spirit body, bringing back Azik’s copper whistle,
Meursault’s Beyonder characteristic, the self-made charms, all sorts of
materials, and the tarot cards to the real world, leaving behind only a
few items, such as the bloodied contract.
After doing all of this and equipping the corresponding items, Klein’s
strength returned to its peak, and he was once again half an expert in
mysticism.
He straightened his collar, took his hat and cane, and left 15 Minsk
Street.
…
Iron Gate Street, inside Bravehearts Bar.
In exchange for a glass of beer, Klein found Kaspars in a card room,
playing Fighting Evil while betting on a boxer outside. He was
leading quite a pleasant life.
The familiar surroundings reminded Klein of the last time he had met
Maric playing poker with more than ten living corpses. He was
suddenly glad that he hadn’t brought Azik’s copper whistle with him.
If I carried the copper whistle that Mr. Azik had given me, I think that a
dozen or so of Maric’s zombies would mutiny on the spot and come to
“entertain” me warmly… I wonder what kind of expression he would
have… Klein stood by the door, nodding at Kaspars Kalinin to
indicate his intentions.
Kaspars covered his cards and swore. He got up, walked to the door,
and said in a low voice, “I’ll take you to a place where the people,
although they aren’t as good as Maric, are pretty strong. As for
whether or not you can make a deal, it has nothing to do with me.
However, I have to warn you in advance, you are not to anger them,
or you might not be able to see the sun tomorrow. Of course, it’s not
easy to see the sun in Backlund after September.”
“Do I need to pay you?” Klein asked sincerely.
Kaspars nodded, pleased.
“Two pounds.”
I can buy a revolver with that money at a weapons store… Although they
set the price at more than three pounds, it can basically be haggled for
around two pounds…Klein grumbled and gave Kaspars two one-pound
notes.
Kaspars turned his head to his fellow players to inform them that he
was leaving. Hobbling along, he led Klein towards the bar’s kitchen,
and from there, entered the back alley and circled around a darkened
house.
He took out an iron mask that could only cover half a face, handed it
to Klein, and chuckled.
“Just pretend that you bought this for two pounds.”
I can buy a lot more with two pounds… Klein wore the iron mask and
deliberately messed up his hair.
Seeing that he was ready, Kaspars knocked on the door rhythmically.
Seven or eight seconds later, a small wooden board on the door was
suddenly pulled open, revealing a pair of brown eyes behind it.
After a long moment of scrutiny, Klein ﬁnally saw the door open
behind him.
A man wearing an iron mask stood there and handed Klein a hooded
robe. He said to Kaspars in a hoarse voice, “Next time, remember to
tell me in advance. Otherwise, hmph!”
He closed the door, turned, and led Klein through the darkened living
room into the activity room on the ﬁrst ﬂoor.
There was a candle burning on the coﬀee table, and the room was
dimly lit.
There were about ten people sitting on the sofas and chairs around
the coﬀee table. They were all wearing hooded robes and wearing
iron masks.
After putting on the long robe, Klein quietly found a chair in a corner
and sat down. He heard a fat-faced man complain, “Recently, there
has been a group of wild beasts in the sewers that have gnawed away
a lot of the herbs I grew.
“They’re very smart and didn’t even touch the poisonous ones. I need
someone to help me clean them up. You know, this isn’t my specialty.
I’m only good at concocting medicine and treating your illnesses.”
Chapter 240: Trying Your Luck?
Good at concocting medicine, treating illnesses, and growing quite a few
medicinal herbs in the sewers… Is he an Apothecary? I wonder if he’s a
member of the Life School of Thought or a believer of Mother Earth? Of
course, it’s more likely for him to be unaﬃliated… Klein listened
thoughtfully but didn’t speak out carelessly.
In the Loen Kingdom, due to the Church of the Lord of Storms
rejecting the Eternal Blazing Sun and the God of Knowledge and
Wisdom, while the Church of the Evernight Goddess and the Church
of the God of Combat were irreconcilable; as a result of this, among
the foreign religions, only the Church of Mother Earth had obtained
the right to preach, but under the tacit suppression from the three
Churches. They only had a few churches with very few believers, to
the point that they didn’t even need to form a team of Beyonders.
And even if they did, they wouldn’t be recognized by the government
and couldn’t cooperate with the police department. They would be
considered as vigilantes.
According to the conﬁdential information of the Nighthawks, the
Church of Mother Earth had two sequence paths in its control:
Planter and Apothecary. However, the latter was apparently
incomplete.
The suspected Apothecary didn’t have his hood on. He revealed a
black iron mask on his face, but it only covered the part above the
bridge of his nose, making the quivering fat on his cheeks appear to
stand out.
“I repeat, I need someone to clean up the newly appeared beast in the
sewers. I only need the area around Backlund Bridge cleaned up.
Payment will be with four bottles of my precious medicine; two of
them can eﬀectively stop bleeding and stimulate the healing of
wounds. Trust me, this is better than going to the clinic to do a suture
operation, and it’s eﬀective for six months,” the man suspected to be
an Apothecary stated his requirements and corresponding conditions.
He suddenly let out a soft laugh and continued to describe the case,
“The other two bottles can last one and a half months, and can allow
a man to ﬁnd the urges from back when he was seventeen or
eighteen years old and become a Beyonder on the bed. Hehe, you
know what I mean. Even if it exceeds the use-by date, it can still
produce eﬀects, but it will also spread throughout the body. The user
will become abnormally violent and their strength, speed, and agility
will greatly increase before exhaustion kicks in half an hour later.
Why does he look like those old military doctors who plaster their tiny
advertisements everywhere… And shamelessly promoting the eﬀects of his
expired drugs… Klein couldn’t help but silently lampoon.
Seeing the silent room after he said his piece, the suspected
Apothecary could only grit his teeth and say, “I’ll add 30 pounds on
top of my 4 precious bottles of medicine!”
Finally, a man sitting somewhere along the periphery of the couches
spoke up.
He surveyed the area and said in a deep voice, “I accept this
commission. You should pay an advance with two bottles of
medicine, one of each kind. Mr. Eye of Wisdom will bear witness.”
“No problem,” said an elder seated on a single sofa with a nod.
The lines on his cheeks were deep, his skin a little shriveled, and his
voice had an ancient quality to it, so Klein judged him to be an
elderly gentleman.
“Alright.” The suspected Apothecary heaved a sigh of relief.
After the conclusion of this transaction, the gathering seemed to turn
more lively. Soon, a woman with her face completely covered by a
hood said, “I want to sell two weapons.”
Weapons? Klein adjusted his posture and became more focused.
Since he was temporarily unable to advance, he could only increase
his strength by using external items.
“One of them is an inscribed steel sword. It was smithed by the
Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun. It comes with purifying and evil
warding eﬀects. It’s the nemesis of Water Ghosts, Wraiths, Zombies,
and other undead creatures. It can still be used for another three
years. Of course, it’s sharpness is enough to kill.” The woman’s voice
ﬂuctuated in volume, a clear attempt to hide her characteristics. “500
pounds or the Sequence 8 potion, Barbarian, and it will be yours.”
How expensive… For me, there’s no reason I must have it… If I were to
encounter an undead that I’m currently unable to deal with, blowing the
whistle is the best solution… Even without Mr. Azik, the messenger alone
should be able to intimidate many undead creatures… Klein shook his
head and listened to the lady’s introduction of the second weapon.
“Meat Cleaver, with exquisite mechanical structure. It can be
transformed, making it easy to carry. This is a combat weapon, made
by an outstanding craftsman. It’s rarely seen, and will cost 25
pounds.”
There sure is a huge diﬀerence in pricing between weapons with Beyonder
eﬀects and those without… Klein watched from the sidelines until the
steel sword was bought by a sullen gentleman in another corner, and
the Meat Cleaver became part of Mr. Eye of Wisdom’s collection.
There were successes and failures in the few deals that followed. The
only thing that tempted Klein was a “Fortune Accessory,” a Beyonder
item that could make a person’s luck with fortune rise for three
months. However, this wasn’t his main goal, and the price wasn’t that
great.
Seeing that the atmosphere had turned silent once again, he slowly
exhaled and said in a suppressed voice, “I want to sell something.”
After attracting everyone’s attention, he took out an iron cigarette
case and pushed out the crimson Beyonder characteristic which
resembled jelly.
Without needing to organizing his words, he introduced it with
something he had already prepared ahead of time.
“This is something I obtained from a corpse. I’m not sure what use it
has; it’s just that I ﬁnd it very magical. Maybe some of you know
what this is?”
Klein deliberately didn’t mention that this was a Beyonder
characteristic, nor did he mention that the crimson “jelly” in his hand
could replace the main ingredient of the Hunter potion.
This involved the Law of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility,
and he didn’t want to beneﬁt the members of this Beyonder gathering
with this knowledge.
In addition to this, Klein had the intention of probing to see if anyone
there knew the Law of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility.
Such a person would deﬁnitely be stronger than the rest, or perhaps
someone with a powerful background, making them suitable as a
bodyguard.
At the same time, he continued to disguise himself as an ordinary
person who didn’t know much about the Beyonder community.
Although the members of the gathering couldn’t see his appearance
through the iron mask, Kaspars Kalinin knew what he looked like,
and quite a few people in the room probably knew Kaspars.
Being “careful” and “prudent” were the two things Klein had
emphasized to himself before leaving home today.
Gazes examined the crimson object in his hand, but Klein wasn’t a
Spectator and couldn’t tell what they meant.
After more than ten seconds, no one spoke. The room was as quiet as
a cemetery.
At this moment, the old gentleman sitting on the sofa, Mr. Eye of
Wisdom, coughed and said, “I have a rough idea of what it is and
what it does, but knowledge needs to be exchanged with something
in return.
“I’ll pay four hundred pounds; believe me, it’s a perfectly fair price.
Of course, you have the right to refuse.”
The main ingredients of Sequence 9 potions are about 150 to 200 pounds.
Two are needed, and they add up to about 400 pounds… The oﬀer is very
reasonable… This old gentleman with the code name Eye of Wisdom
seems to recognize that this belongs to the Hunter Sequence… He had no
need for divination, and he was able to recognize it immediately…. Could
it be the Sequence 7 of the Sequencers pathway, Appraiser?
Klein thought for a moment and said, “Deal. However, sir, you don’t
need to rush to pay. I still have another request.”
“What request?” Eye of Wisdom asked in an old voice.
Klein pondered and said, “The thing is, I oﬀended someone. Uh,
according to your circle, he should be Sequence 6 or maybe, 5. I wish
to hire a bodyguard.”
“Sequence 6, maybe Sequence 5? Why don’t you just die quietly? If
we reached that level, why would we be attending such a small
gathering?” the suspected Apothecary blurted out with a bit of a
sneer in his astonishment.
Although the other members of the party didn’t say anything, from
the looks of it, no one planned on accepting the request. Their
thoughts were similar to those of the suspected Apothecary.
Eye of Wisdom chuckled and said, “Maybe you don’t know our circle
well enough. People at Sequence 6 or Sequence 5 are very, very
powerful and terrifying people. Yes, there have been many cases of a
lot of Sequence 8 and Sequence 9 Beyonders killing someone that
strong, but those are events that are still very hard to replicate. I
think no one here is willing to take such a huge risk to protect you,
uh… If you’re certain that the other party is only Sequence 6 and
doesn’t have any mystical items, there might be someone who will
want to accept the challenge this mission entails.”
“Well, I’m not sure…” Klein shrugged and said, “Then I’ll have to try
to save myself. What can I get for 400 pounds? Uh, the mystical item
you were talking about?”
“Believe me, a mystical item worth 400 pounds certainly won’t be
able to deal with your enemy, and it will even bring you more
danger. I suggest that you apologize to him. Sincerely apologize and
perhaps 400 pounds will be enough to buy his understanding,” Eye of
Wisdom said sincerely.
Frankly, I’ve thought about it, but I don’t think they’ll accept it… Klein
was about to answer when the man who had accepted the task of
cleaning the sewer beast suddenly laughed.
“Maybe, you can try your luck.
“I have a mystical item here that I can sell you for 400 pounds.
“It can let you hear the voice of a great being. If you’re lucky and can
decipher some useful information, you’ll become very powerful, and
it will no longer be diﬃcult for you to protect yourself. Well, if you’re
unlucky and end up deciphering a curse, or fail to decipher it, then
you’ll be hurt, or even end up dying.
“Do you want to take the gamble?”
Before he could ﬁnish his sentence, Eye of Wisdom growled, “Black
Snake, don’t mention that ominous item of yours!”
Black Snake laughed and said, “I’m not lying, I’m not violating the
rules here either. I told him about the advantages and disadvantages
and left him to make his own choice. Hmm, the probability of getting
useful information is approximately 10%; do you want to take the
gamble?”
The Russian roulette of the Beyonder world… Hearing the voice of a great
being… Is this the Aurora Order’s Listener? An item left behind after a
Listener lost control?Klein looked at Black Snake, that he suspected to
be a member of the Aurora Order, and made many connections.
Perhaps I can bet on it? No, I can’t call it a bet, because I’ll bring this item
to the world above the gray fog before using it… I can already bring real
objects there… This way, I can avoid most of the danger… However, this
is only an item left behind by a Sequence 8 Beyonder. The corresponding
beneﬁt might not be that good… Four hundred pounds isn’t cheap… As
his thoughts raced through his mind, Klein nodded solemnly and
said, “Deal.”
Chapter 241: Language of
Foulness
There was only a single candle that illuminated the room. The
atmosphere in the living room was so silent that it was as if
everything had frozen.
A few seconds later, the suspected Apothecary ﬁnally muttered, “Why
don’t you leave an address? That way, I can get something out of
your body.”
He looks like he’s cursing me, but he’s actually persuading me otherwise…
Klein pretended not to understand and said to Black Snake, “I don’t
have any chance of survival if I don’t gamble. There’ll be that sliver
of hope if I gamble on it.
“I won’t sit back and wait for death.”
Hearing this, Eye of Wisdom, who was about to say something, shut
his mouth because he couldn’t oﬀer any other hope.
“I really admire your character!” Black Snake laughed.
“I also admire you. In the past, I had quite a few friends who had
such characters. Now, I visit their tombstones every year and place a
bunch of ﬂowers there,” the suspected Apothecary mused in a
mocking but actually persuasive manner.
He didn’t care that Black Snake was a better ﬁghter than he was. He
said whatever he wanted to.
Mr. Apothecary must have suﬀered because of his temper… Klein was
secretly grateful.
He handed the iron cigarette case containing the Hunter Beyonder
characteristic to the attendant who brought it to Eye of Wisdom.
The old gentleman counted out 400 pounds in cash from the suitcase
beside him and got the attendant to pass it on to Black Snake.
Black Snake casually took a glance and said, “I believe in Mr. Eye of
Wisdom.”
He took out a small wooden box, bent down, and placed it on the
ground. He pushed the box so that the object slid to Klein without
going through the attendant.
The moment Klein’s ﬁngers touched the surface of the box, he heard
faint illusory sounds and immediately felt a strong sense of dizziness.
For him, this wasn’t something he couldn’t handle. It wasn’t even
comparable to the illusory voices of Justice and company when they
pray to him.
After sitting up straight again, Klein carefully opened the wooden box
and saw a “ear” inside!
The ears looked real, except that the skin was dark and there were a
few green areas where it had rotted.
“How do I use it?” Klein asked.
Black Snake casually replied, “Grasping it without gloves is the same
as using it. Heh, you’d better go home and try it when you’re alone.”
Klein didn’t ask any further questions. He closed the box and put it
into his pocket. He deliberately smiled bitterly and said, “This makes
me dizzy.”
After a short moment of silence, the suspected Apothecary suddenly
shouted, “I want to buy Spring of the Elves marrow crystals, who has
it?”
As his voice echoed in the air, no one answered.
The Apothecary smacked his lips and mumbled, “Seriously, there’s no
answer every time this is asked.”
“Maybe you could book a cruise to Sonia Island,” Eye of Wisdom
quipped.
The Spring of the Elves was also known as the Sonia Golden Springs,
and one could tell from its name where it came from. The Spring of
the Elves was a commonly seen liquid and was an object with rich
spirituality. However, the marrow crystals were considered Beyonder
ingredients and not easily purchasable.
After that, there were a few failed transactions at the gathering. Eye
of Wisdom clapped his hands and said, “Let’s end it here today.
According to the convention, we leave one by one, each separated by
three minutes.”
Leaving one by one… Each separated by three minutes… This is to
prevent the Gathering members from being tailed and robbed? When
Klein received the signal from Eye of Wisdom, he stood up and,
guided by the attendant, left the activity room, and went to the door.
He took oﬀ his hooded robe and handed it back to the attendant
before following the path in his memories back to the back door of
the Bravehearts Bar. He then removed his iron mask and walked
through the kitchen to see Kaspars standing outside the card room,
over the barking of dogs and clamoring of people.
“I’m delighted that you could come back.” The red-nosed elder
heaved a sigh of relief, the nasty wounds on his face seemingly
trembling.
Klein leaned over and said in a low voice, “Are there such gatherings
in the future?”
“It seems like you didn’t get what you wanted. Holy Lord of Storms, I
don’t think you should continue wasting your time.” Kaspars scanned
this customer he felt worried for. “Maybe it’ll take a few days. I don’t
know the details. Let’s see if you can make it in time.”
Klein nodded and asked, “Is Maric here?”
“You’re still trying to convince him? No, it will only anger him!”
Kaspars warned him in a deep voice. “He’s in the card room behind
you.”
No, I’m not going to convince him. I’m trying to stay as far away from
him as possible so that his zombies won’t go into mutiny… Klein touched
Azik’s copper whistle in his pocket.
“I understand.”
He left the Bravehearts Bar at once, went to the one-bedroom
apartment in East Borough to relieve himself before returning to
Minsk Street.
Inside the card room, Maric had gone all-in and conﬁdently ﬂipped
open his cards.
He had three Kings and a pair of Nines, and the zombie opposite him
had a pair of Sixes and an Eight.
Suddenly, the zombie took the initiative to reveal its hidden cards, a
pair of Sixes!
This round, it won with four Sixes!
The pale Maric sat there blankly and immediately felt all the
surrounding zombies coldly staring at him.
A few minutes later, he staggered out the card room on shaky feet
and almost collapsed at the door while his usual entourage of
subordinates inside the room fell to the ground.
“Don’t let anyone in before dawn,” Maric ordered in a hoarse voice as
he looked at the stunned Kaspars.
He took out a white handkerchief and wiped the corner of his mouth.
The handkerchief was quickly dyed with a dark blue tint with some
redness.
After receiving Kaspars’s acknowledgment, Maric found a chair to sit
and asked for a barrel of Southville beer. He stared blankly as he
drank.
…
At 15 Minsk Street, Klein followed his usual routine of washing up
and returning to his room before he drew the curtains.
After waiting for over ten minutes and conﬁrming that there were no
specks of spirituality around, he started to summon himself. He
responded to himself and brought the wooden box containing the
black ear into the mysterious space above the gray fog.
The illusory crimson stars didn’t twinkle at all as Klein sat at the seat
of honor of the long ancient table and opened the wooden box.
This time, he didn’t hear any murmurs or feel dizzy. The boundless
gray fog seemed to isolate all external sounds.
Klein let out a sigh of relief. He was now much more conﬁdent with
his impending attempt and much more conﬁdent about his own
safety.
With a thought, he blocked his own hearing and performed a few
experiments to conﬁrm the eﬀects.
That’s right… Klein nodded in satisfaction, reached out, and grabbed
the black ear with signs of rot.
He felt its coldness and slipperiness, but he didn’t hear the voice of
the great being that was described by Black Snake.
Completely isolated? This won’t do… It’s impossible to use it alone…
Klein muttered to himself, puzzled as he thought of the methods he
could use to stimulate an eﬀect.
After a dozen or so seconds, he conjured a pen and paper, intending
to emulate the process he used to spy on the Eternal Blazing Sun
previously.
That time, I looked directly at the Eternal Blazing Sun through the use of
divine blood. This time, I’m only using the remains left behind by a
Listener, so it deﬁnitely isn’t that dangerous… Klein wrote down a
divination statement without any hesitation:
“The origin of this item.”
He took a breath, held the black ear, and leaned back as he recited
the divination statement.
After reciting it seven times, his eyes darkened as he entered a deep
slumber.
In this blurry, shattered, and gray world, Klein saw a man struggling
on the ground. He rolled, screamed, and his eyes bulged out. His
body swelled like a balloon, and countless hairs on his body turned
black and long.
Soon after, an extremely evil and foul voice rang in Klein’s ears,
waking him up instantly.
It was diﬀerent from the ravings and howling that came from the
mysterious space above the gray fog. This sound was more
penetrating, more purposeful, and more active!
Klein covered his ears and isolated any fallout, but the same voice
echoed in his head.
He saw his vessels and veins bulge out as if they had become thick
squirming venomous snakes.
Bang!
His blood vessels burst, and his veins broke oﬀ from his body,
spreading out into slippery tentacles ﬁlled with sinister patterns. The
gray fog slightly swayed, making the giant’s palace look like it was
about to corrode.
Unlike the incident with the Eternal Blazing Sun, Klein still retained
his sanity and didn’t roll over on the ground. He gripped the handrail
tightly and endured the pain.
After a few seconds, the slightly swaying gray fog regained its calm,
and the evil voice that echoed in Klein’s mind completely died down.
One “tentacle” after another fell to the ground, and his wounds began
to rapidly heal.
Interacting with deities is truly a dangerous matter, regardless of the
method… Thankfully, I didn’t face the True Creator directly this time. If
not, I’ll have remnants of madness and signs of losing control and would
aﬀect my body in the real world…Klein weakly leaned back into his
chair and silently mocked himself.
This process was within his expectations, and it didn’t go out of his
control.
The only thing that surprised him was that the True Creator appeared
to be slightly stronger than the Eternal Blazing Sun…
Just as Klein’s thoughts were about to wander oﬀ, he saw the black
ear in his palm suddenly crumbled, turning into tiny specks of black
light.
It has become a pure Beyonder characteristic? Amidst his confusion, he
saw through the corner of his eyes that the sinister-patterned
tentacles were still twitching on the ground. They were the aspects of
madness and loss of control that had been stripped from his body.
These tentacles gradually turned transparent and were about to
disappear.
A ﬂash of brilliance came to Klein’s mind. He scattered the tiny black
light specks in his palm at those slippery tentacles.
An illusionary black gas rose up and turned into a sky that constantly
streaked with lightning. The background was extremely dense and
gloomy.
All of this quickly disappeared from Klein’s eyes. On the surface of
the iron-black charm on the ground were many symbols, magic
labels, sinister patterns, and twisted path numbers.
Klein bent down and picked it up, with the feeling that what was
sealed inside were howling maniacs.
With the help of his divination techniques, he was able to barely
decipher the use of this charm from its revelation. It was to let the
opponent hear a terrifying roar, infecting them with madness. As for
the ﬁnal result, it depended on the target’s ability to resist such
attacks. If the target was strong, then they might beneﬁt from it, but
the price was becoming a devout believer of the True Creator, and if
he was weak, he would collapse on the spot, dying amidst tragic
cries.
I’ll call it Language of Foulness… Klein muttered and set an incantation
to activate it.
Chapter 242: Bakerland
Early Tuesday morning, Klein woke up naturally and prepared two
slices of toast, a piece of butter, a serving of bacon, and a cup of
coﬀee before leisurely reading a newspaper while having breakfast.
With the terrifying Language of Foulness charm, he was much more
at ease. He was no longer as tense as he was before.
Klein ﬁnished ﬂipping through the Backlund Bulletin, picked up the
Tussock Times, and saw a news article on the second page.
“At two o’clock this morning, there was a ﬁerce gunﬁght at Red Brick
Alley in the East Borough. According to the police, it is suspected to
be a clash between two gangs, one of which is the notorious Zmanger
gang.”
The Zmanger gang… Red Brick Alley in the East Borough… A thought
occurred to Klein as he left the dining table and found the map of
Backlund.
With just a glance, he noticed that Red Brick Alley wasn’t far from
Bacardi Street. Furthermore, Ian Wright had previously appeared at
the telegraph oﬃce on Bacardi Street.
Was Red Brick Alley where Ian Wright was hiding? Was the violent
conﬂict between the military’s special department and the intelligence staﬀ
of the Intis Republic? I wonder what the result will be… Klein picked up
the last of the bacon, put it in his mouth, and chewed it slowly.
He had “informed” both sides about the divination the previous
morning and they had already locked onto Ian’s location that very
night, which implied quite a high level of eﬃciency.
After taking a sip of coﬀee, Klein put down the newspaper and fell
into deep thought.
Suddenly, he heard the tinkling of the doorbell.
“Who is it?” Klein wiped his mouth with a napkin and headed for the
door, puzzled.
Could it be a new commission? For the past few days, I’ve been out and
about because of the Intis Ambassador. I wonder how many jobs and
potential clients I’ve lost… It’s such a waste of my advertising money… If
this goes on, my ﬁnances will be stretched to the limit… Klein suddenly
thought of something and opened the door.
Standing outside were two ladies, one of them being Mrs. Sammer,
who wore a dressing gown. She had intricate makeup on her face,
making her look more beautiful than at home and nothing like she
was in her thirties. The other lady wore a wide-brimmed hat with a
black tartan veil, and a darker, more ﬂuﬀy dress.
“Detective Moriarty, I have a friend who needs your help.” Stelyn
Sammer held onto her veiled hat, but there was no hint of a smile in
her blue eyes.
“Please come in.” Klein pointed to the living room, and while he was
turning around, he took the opportunity to fasten the top button of
his shirt and adjusted his black vest.
Stelyn nodded slightly and, without another word, led the black-
veiled lady into the room.
She knew the place very well, and without Klein’s guidance, easily
found the sofa and took her seat.
Klein wanted to immediately start asking, but then thought about
Stelyn Sammer’s style of doing things, so he asked with a smile,
“Coﬀee or tea?”
In his eyes, Mrs. Sammer was a lady who pursued a high quality of
life and tried to showed her superiority all the time.
“There’s no need.” The other lady took oﬀ her hat.
She had good features, but the combination was disappointing. In
addition, her cheekbones were too high, and she looked older than
her actual age.
A little anger, a little sadness, a little hesitation, a little fear… Klein read
the lady’s emotions.
It wasn’t that he suddenly possessed the abilities of a Spectator, but
that the lady’s actions were just too obvious.
“Yes, neither coﬀee nor tea can solve the problem.” Stelyn imitated a
position found in magazines, trying her best to appear classy. “This is
Mrs. Mary Gale, a shareholder of Coim Company.”
“What would you like to entrust me with, Mrs. Gale?” Klein sat down
on a single-seater, leaning forward slightly and resting his arms on
his thighs.
“Don’t call me Mrs. Gale. Just call me Mary.” Mary Gale pursed her
lips. “I wish for you to tail my husband and conﬁrm if he has a
mistress. It’s best if you can obtain material evidence.”
As a result of the Church of the Evernight Goddess’s active push for
years, the Loen Kingdom was more radical in its marriage laws than
the other countries, such as Feysac, Intis, and Lenburg. It stipulated
that those who committed adultery had to pay a ﬁnancial price for it,
which meant that the adulterer would be at an absolute disadvantage
during the division of property.
I’ve heard that at least four out of ten of the other private detectives are
investigating extramarital aﬀairs… I didn’t expect that I would receive
such a job too… Klein said thoughtfully, “Material evidence is not
easy to obtain.”
“I’ll lend you the latest portable camera,” Mary replied without any
hesitation. “As long as you have the evidence, I will pay you ten
pounds. If you only conﬁrm that he has a mistress, you will only
receive three pounds.”
You mean the so-called portable camera that’s about two-thirds the size of
my head? 10 pounds, this isn’t a low price… Mr. Klein has been
focusing on entrepreneurship and knew about the latest cameras.
He hesitated for two seconds before saying, “Alright.”
“But you have to provide me with detailed information about your
husband and his regular activities.”
“… No problem!” Mary paused for a second before gathering all her
strength to say it.
“Thank you for your help. I hope you won’t tell anyone else about
this,” Stelyn reminded him.
Hearing this, Klein immediately sighed, “I’m a person who upholds
conﬁdentiality, and I often get into trouble for that.”
…
In the lobby of Count Wolf’s house, men and women were dancing
amid violin tunes.
Audrey was carrying a glass of pale gold champagne when she
“accidentally” bumped into the Intis Republic ambassador to Loen,
Bakerland Jean Madan.
“You’re the most beautiful young lady I’ve ever met.” Bakerland, with
his thin face and slight stubble, pecked Audrey’s white-gauzed glove
with a kiss according to propriety customs. His eyes looked
passionate and bold.
Audrey rolled her eyes and said with a chuckle, “Is this the way
people from Intis talk?”
“Yes, we are never stingy with praise for beautiful things.” Bakerland
chuckled. “If it wasn’t for the style of the Loen Kingdom, I might have
called you my angel.”
Old pervert… Audrey maintained her graceful smile and said, “The
people of Loen and Intis are indeed diﬀerent.”
“Heh, that makes me think of a joke. Please allow me to be
presumptuous.” Bakerland squinted his eyes and said, “After a good
time with a beautiful girl, most Loen men would say, ‘Oh, dear, I’d
like a cigarette’, but most Intis men would say…”
He deliberately paused, and Audrey tilted her head, trying her best to
keep her nausea in check while looking puzzled.
“What would they say?”
“Most of the Intis men would say, ‘Oh, baby, I have to return now
and can’t be discovered by my wife.'” Bakerland raised his glass and
laughed.
“… People who can laugh at themselves always have an additional
charm to them.” Audrey smiled politely.
Her beautiful, clear, dark green eyes suddenly turned to look behind
Ambassador Bakerland.
“I’m sorry, a friend is looking for me.”
“It’s a pleasure talking to you.” Bakerland bowed and moved aside.
Audrey moved forward gracefully and didn’t look back again.
Just as she was considering who she should ﬁnd as the object of her
excuse, a young gentleman approached her and, lowering his voice,
warned her, “Audrey, don’t be fooled by that Ambassador Bakerland,
he’s a dirty old man! I don’t know how many women he’s tricked into
bed.
Bakerland is lustful? This is in line with my observations… This is a
weakness…Audrey smiled without hiding her disgust.
“Kance, do you have a misconception about me? Goddess, how could
I be bewitched by that Ambassador Bakerland? His cologne makes me
want to vomit; his words are so foul, and his taste is like a male
peacock.”
Kance was Viscount Leerhsen’s youngest son, and their family was on
fairly good terms with the Hall family.
According to Audrey, Kance had entered MI9 after graduating from
Tingen University and had become quite enigmatic.
Her original plan had been to have a chat with Ambassador
Backlund, and observe him up close before using the pretext of
exasperation to get more information from Kance and his other
friends from the intelligence community to learn more about him. To
her surprise, she didn’t need to seek out Kance Leerhsen since he
came over and started the corresponding conversation on his own
accord.
“Your feelings are correct.” Kance gave a sincere smile. He surveyed
his surroundings and whispered, “Besides, Bakerland is a very
dangerous fellow.”
“How dangerous?” Audrey asked curiously.
“Have you heard of Beyonders? I know that you’ve always been
interested in such matters,” Kance said with some deliberation.
Audrey gently nodded.
“I know quite a bit, most of it being told to me by Glaint.”
Kance took a glance at Bakerland, who was chatting with an aﬄuent
lady, and said with a serious expression, “He’s Intis’s intelligence
head in our Kingdom. He’s done numerous atrocities, but we haven’t
been able to gather any evidence of his crimes. He’s a Sequence 6, a
Conspiracist.”
He didn’t go into details with an outsider like Audrey, nor did he
mention that Conspiracist was part of the Hunter pathway.
However, Audrey was already aware of this. She feigned naivety and
sighed.
“He’s really amazing!”
“He has an assistant in the shadows, one that has perhaps reached
Sequence 5. In addition to that, all of the Intis intelligence agents in
the Kingdom are under his management. Many of them are
Beyonders. Unfortunately, we only know a few of them…” Kance
added in passing. “Don’t be too happy if Bakerland praises you either.
It’s not what he truly thinks. He just wants to use this opportunity to
gather more information.”
I don’t like what you’re saying… Audrey looked up at the ornate
chandelier and thought for a few seconds.
“Is Bakerland very smart? You haven’t managed to get any
incriminating evidence…”
“He truly is good at scheming, but he also has a lot of problems. He
likes to chase after women and loves the feeling of romance. He takes
risks and is quite radical. If it wasn’t for his identity as an ambassador
preventing us from taking action easily, he would’ve been captured
long ago.” Kance stroked his chin and said, “However, he’ll be
replaced very soon. Very soon.”
“Why?” Audrey asked in surprise.
“My dear beautiful lady, this isn’t something you should know.”
Kance adhered to the principle of conﬁdentiality.
When the ball was almost over, Audrey, who had gathered quite a bit
of information, found Viscount Glaint and asked him to help her
contact Xio and Fors.
Chapter 243: Catching the
Adulterous Act
Wednesday morning, across from the Coim Company, in the
Cherwood Borough.
Klein was sitting on a wooden bench outside the Gardeley
department store, clutching a paper bag containing the most famous
Cyndi Desi pie in the area with one hand, and holding a cup of iced
tea in the other.
Beside him, a tramp was curled up on the other side of the bench,
sleeping. Ten minutes later, the mall’s security guard woke him up
and shooed him away.
Klein wore gold-rimmed spectacles which didn’t provide for any
vision correction and a silk half top hat. He didn’t look much
diﬀerent from most of the gentlemen around him.
He idly looked across the street at the Coim Company, lifted his right
hand, and took a large bite of the Cyndi Desi pie. He felt the rich
aroma gush out and ﬁll his oral cavity.
The reason why this pie from Desi Bay stood out amongst the
southern pies was that it used a lot of oil and fat, but the meat was
chopped into very tiny bits. With the fat and lean meat mixed
together, it didn’t feel too heavy.
The rich, meaty juice seeped into the outer crust, neutralizing the
dryness and made up for its shortcomings. The wheat fragrance was
clearly brought out, and the small pieces of crushed apples were used
to stimulate appetite with a slightly sour and sweet taste while
neutralizing the oily taste.
It’s okay… Although the weather isn’t good and the pollution is terrible,
Backlund is far superior to Tingen in many other aspects. Foods of all
styles can be found everywhere. There are all kinds of operas and plays
available. They can be enjoyed as long as one isn’t afraid to spend
money… Although I might not necessarily eat or partake in such
entertainment, I have these options at the very least. This is the advantage
of a big city… Klein raised his sweet iced tea and took a sip.
He never took his eyes oﬀ the Coim Company’s entrance. For that ten
pounds, he had been sitting there since eight in the morning. Even
his breakfast was bought on the way there.
Of course, for most private detectives, a commission of ten pounds
was an absolutely enviable business, equivalent to about three weeks’
salary for a member of the middle class!
According to the information provided by Mary Gale, her husband
was currently the ﬁrst manager of Coim Company and was Luke
Sammer’s superior; however, their shares in the Coim Company came
from Mary’s father, and Mary had inherited it.
One of the immediate reasons she suspected her husband of having a
mistress was that an employee in the company had divulged to her
that Doragu Gale would leave the oﬃce on Wednesday and Friday
mornings alone and only return in the afternoon. In addition, he
would leave work early for two days a week, and Mary had never
seen her husband return home before seven.
After breakfast, Klein waited another hour plus before seeing his
target walk out of Coim.
He was wearing a black top hat, a double-breasted tweed coat, and a
standard bow tie. He was slightly fat, with yellowish temples, slightly
brownish eyes, and a slightly long face.
Doragu Gale… He silently recited his target’s name, stood up, picked
up his cane and his heavy portable camera, and crossed the road.
Instead of getting his carriage driver to pick him up, he stood by the
side of the road and looked around for a rental carriage.
Klein took the opportunity to cross the road and arrive beside him.
Pretending to be careless, he bumped into his target.
“Sorry, I’m quite lost.” Klein bowed his head in apology.
Doragu frowned, but remained silent, waving his hand to indicate
that it didn’t matter.
Klein bent down, bowed, and walked to the end of the street.
He didn’t run into Doragu in order to steal his belongings and use the
dowsing method to easily track him. That would’ve been easily
noticeable.
Instead, Klein had only done one thing when he collided with
Doragu. With the help of his agility as a Clown, he had secretly
slipped a spare button of his into one of the pockets of Doragu’s
double-breasted coat.
Going around a corner, he stopped and looked back just in time to
see Doragu board a rental carriage.
Klein was in no hurry to tail him. He waited patiently for a few
minutes before slowly getting into another horse carriage and said to
the carriage driver, “Just go according to my instructions. Head to
the end of the street ﬁrst.”
“Alright.” The driver didn’t ask why.
Inside the carriage, Klein leaned his cane and began performing a
divination.
However, his divination statement wasn’t directed at Doragu Gale;
instead, it became “the whereabouts of the spare button of my
clothes!”
The Dowsing Rod Seeking was originally the most practical technique
to ﬁnd objects. Only Seers were able to use it to seek people. Now,
Klein was using it in its original form.
The easiest and most convenient items to ﬁnd were those that
belonged to himself!
Along the way, Klein kept getting the carriage driver to change
directions until they ﬁnally arrived at a street house in the Hillston
Borough. When they ﬁrst circled it, Klein noticed that there were
gardens and lawns behind the house, which was diﬀerent from the
other houses.
His dowsing method told him that Doragu Gale was inside that
